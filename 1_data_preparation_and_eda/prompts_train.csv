He made the points you had prepared. Kinder agreed to shelve the legislation for this session. He said he had been hearing from several others including Proctor and Gamble (which has a big facility in his district) that the legislation was not going to help competition develop in the state. He expressed willingness to work with us on a better package and also expressed interest in coming to Enron's offices. He is going to be in San Antonio in August and would like to come to Houston around that time. [/INST] Category: Logistic Arrangements(meeting scheduling, technical support, etc)"

Below are some of my observations: While it's premature to say we have an energy crisis we are witnessing the triple threat of high summer gasoline prices spiking electricity prices and high natural gas prices for the upcoming heating season (I'll send along some of the data). There is at least the potential for this to become a prominent national political issue: Gore has focussed relentlessly on Bush's ties to big oil (which includes us by the way though we produce nary a drop) and Congressional republicans have blamed the current administration for failing to have a coherent energy policy (though at least so far the dominant characteristic of the administration's policy has been a republicanesque reliance on the market). Notwithstanding the issue's potential to become political fodder and its prominence in the popular press many Americans seem blissfully ignorant at least on the electricity issue. We did some focus group testing recently in Southern California -- a mere 15 minutes from the epicenter of the San Diego price quakes -- and most people knew nothing about it. So while the issue has the potential for political traction it may not have caught on yet (except in places like San Diego and New York city. The reaction in California has been to call for government intervention in electricity markets. Investigations of out of state price gougers and profiteers have been undertaken and wholesale and retail price caps have been put in place. They have not worked -- at least in wholesale markets. Suppliers are deciding to site plants elsewhere and when prices are high elsewhere in the West power flows out of California to those other markets. Ironically though I can't explain it in classical economic terms the setting of rate caps in wholesale markets has had the effect of pulling prices up to the capped levels in offpeak times when there is more than enough supply. For the most part though the caps and the other political reactions have been somewhat muted: policy makers have been reluctant to throw the deregulation plan out and start over and the retail price caps have been relatively narrow ... so far. Outside of California the authors of other states' deregulation plans have distinguished their proposals from California's. Regulators and legislators from such diverse places as Connecticut Texas and Alberta have gone out of their way to defend their plans and explain why California won't happen here. For the most part then the reaction to California has been positive from Enron's perspective in states that have already deregulated. There does remain some threat that aspects of the state plans (e.g. utility plant divestiture) may be postponed or cancelled. The story is a bit more grim in states that were considering deregulation but have not gone forward with their plans: I think it's off the agenda in most places. The fact that most of the major markets (about 70% of total electric revenue) are already deregulated/deregulating is a blessing in that regard. At the federal level there has been a combination of the burn the village in order to save it approach -- allow some price caps to remove the pressure to reverse the whole deregulation program -- and a more positive call for comprehensive reform. All in all I believe we're OK so far and we need to look at this as an opportunity: business is booming we sell protection from price volatility and the need for such protection is now plastered over the front pages of major newspapers. On the public policy front we need to convert the controversy into productive action. Our target has been FERC -- they are somewhat removed from the white hot rhetoric in California and they are a single commissioner's vote away from taking action to further open the market. Enron's response: Initially we hoped to feed information into industry groups and let them carry the message our concern was that Enron -- a company which was in and out of the residential market in Cal. -- would not make the most attractive champion for the open market message. We hoped that the new generators in Cal would take up the mantle. It's fair to say that they fumbled the ball: they are now locked in a pitched battle with the utilities over price caps and fall all to easily into the out of state profiteer label .... standing between Aunt Millie and rate relief. They were also extremely slow out of the blocks with a more productive message. We are now working the issue directly. We are working the issue on a number of levels: 1) PR - we have good contacts in the press and have talked to numerous reporters and editorial writers. As time goes on the information and reporting has gotten somewhat better. 2) Govt relations - we have been pushing for power plant siting legislation in California (the market wants to build capacity but the government won't let it). This may be the best environment we'll ever see for streamlining the permitting process. Also in typical Enron fashion we put a deal on the table. We offered to sell power to the local utility at a price which would enable them to lock in stable rates for their customers at below current rates. Our offer was followed by nine others and we tried to make something of the fact that the market was offering better solutions than California politicians. SDG&E dropped the ball unfortunately. Instead of seizing the opportunity they ended up going along with a government granted rate discount which will cause them to accrue a massive deferral account. At the federal level we are contacting members the DOE and FERC. Here we are making a push for FERC action to finish leveling the playing field in wholesale markets so power can get from where it is to where its needed. Additionally we are developing a prepackaged system (including software) for nondiscriminatory open access (to take away any lingering excuses or delays). 3) Overall messaging -- we have been working with a well known political pollster to check our messages for their resonance at the grassroots level. As we hone these messages we will be using them in the fora we are currently working. Overall we have more opportunity than risk in the current environment but capitalizing on those opportunities continues to be a long shot. An intersting rhetorical challenge for us is this: much of the problem in power markets is blamed on high upstream fuel prices particularly natural gas. The gas market is open and structured pretty much the way we are advocating for electricity so how can we maintain that the problem in power markets is an absence of open markets when the most open commodity market on the planet (natural gas) is producing such outsized prices? The answer is somewhat complicated and therefore a bit unsatisfactory in the current debate: gas prices are still lower in real terms than they were pre-deregulation long term prices are also lower than historical levels ( the curve is backwardated (sp?) meaning that prices in later years are lower than today so you can buy gas for 3 years at a price lower than current spot prices) and the economy is booming and driving up demand for basic inputs (this begs the question: why didn't the market react sooner and avoid the spike?). When all else fails a big part of the problem can be blamed on OPEC. We haven't had this thrown at us yet but we are trying to anticipate it and have answers at the ready. This is just the tip of the iceberg. The issue is a great example of the intersection of our business interests with public policy debates and should promote a lively discussion when we get together. Let me know if there is anything else you need. [/INST] Category: Company Business, Strategy, etc.(elaborate in Section 3 [Topics])"

Doug Ose (energy subcommittee chairman of the Government Reform Committee) and Ose's energy advisory board on Wednesday of this week and said similar things. He made a big deal out of a Big Mac analogy -- saying that whether you ordered one in Portland Oregon or Portland Maine the product is the same. With RTOs he supposedly said this meant if the rules are standardized the number of RTOs becomes less important. Those in the room including EPSA staff came away with the impression that Wood is backing away from only 4 RTOs based on this and other comments. Ditto on a 12/15/01 deadline. On the positive side he did say that he had been consulted on the Administration's comments on the Bingaman bill and agreed that legislation without RTO language or bundled/unbundled is OK. He understands the high risk that Congress would go the wrong way on these issues.  [/INST] Category: Company Business, Strategy, etc.(elaborate in Section 3 [Topics])"

Tax is. In summary if a person is terminated from Enron or one of its subsidiaries as a result of a business reorganization the forfeiture penalty is waived. The amount of the waived forfeiture penalty is added to that individuals income as salary (imputed income) and is subject to Federal State and FICA taxes. V&E and I recommend that the changes are effective as of now and not retroactive back to the start of the plan. A retroactive date would weaken the plan as it stands and take out some of the teeth that we put in at its inception.

I read the article below as unsympatheticand almost mocking in its tonetoward Enron. It's noteworthy theBeverly Hills meeting was not covered in the Los Angeles papers. Instead this article comes fromthe front page of the Bay Area's San Francisco Chronicle (Democratic bastion and home to both of California's United States Senators power broker Willie Brown Attorney General Bill Lockyer and the state's public utility commission). Consistent with myconcern about a coast-to-coast firestormengulfing Enron the New York Times ran two articles today that were unsupportiveof the company. q Senator Calls for Hearings Into Energy Regulators' Moves By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS Senator Dianne Feinstein called for hearings into possible improprieties between members of the F.E.R.C. and private energy interests. q Enron's Dispute With Utility in India Grows More Tangled By SARITHA RAI The dispute between the Enron Corporation and Indian federal and state government officials keeps getting messier. These follow the Times' tough piece on Ken Lay yesterday. Undoubtedly the Washington Post will have to get into fray soon. My feeling is that just as with the business side Enron's public policy strategy needs be well informed sophisticated and comprehensive. I fear that anything less will fuel the potential of undesirable outcomes for Enron's reputation leadership and shareholdervalue. Kevin 213-926-2626 PS - May I have a copy of the position paper that was circulated in the Beverly Hills meeting. The Gate www.sfgate.com Return to regular view Enron's secret bid to save deregulation PRIVATE MEETING: Chairman pitches his plan to prominent Californians Christian Berthelsen Scott Winokur Chronicle Staff Writers Saturday May 26 2001 ?2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: Energy executive Kenneth Lay head of powerful Enron Corp. quietly courted Arnold Schwarzenegger Richard Riordan Michael Milken and other luminaries this week in Beverly Hills to drum up support for his solution to California's energy crisis. His prescription called for more rate increases an end to state and federal investigations and less rather than more regulation. Lay a close friend of President Bush and one of his largest campaign contributors hosted a private 90-minute meeting in a conference room at the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills on Thursday. Among the participants were Milken the former head of the Drexel Burnham Lambert investment banking firm who pleaded guilty to fraud charges in 1990 and who now runs a think tank based in Santa Monica movie star Schwarzenegger and Riordan the mayor of Los Angeles. Schwarzenegger and Riordan have been courted recently as GOP gubernatorial candidates. One participant who agreed to speak on the condition he not be identified said the meeting appeared to be geared toward getting participants to support Lay's vision and then champion it to officials who are trying to solve the state's energy mess. PLAN TO RESCUE DEREGULATION The source said the timing and tone of the meeting suggested Lay is concerned that California will abandon its disastrous experiment with power markets by either re-regulating the system or creating a government authority to provide electricity. Gov. Gray Davis signed legislation last week to create and fund a state power authority that would build buy and run power plants in California. They're trying to rescue deregulation the source said of Enron executives. They think the whole state power authority is a bad idea. At the meeting Enron representatives circulated a four-page position paper titled Comprehensive Solution for California which was obtained by The Chronicle. It said ratepayers should bear responsibility for the billions in debt incurred by the state's public utilities and that investigations of power price manipulation and political rhetoric are making matters worse. The paper made no mention of the possibility that much of the runaway electricity costs in California is due to market manipulation by power generators and traders -- a possibility given credibility in studies by regulators and economists. One of the talking points read: Get deregulation right this time -- California needs a real electricity market not government takeovers. Another point suggested giving consumers monetary rebates for conserving electricity. INVOLVED IN EARLY DAYS Lay has been an aggressive champion of deregulated electricity markets and was an early advocate in persuading California to begin its experiment with a competitive power market system. Lay has created a new kind of company in the process one that essentially produces nothing but makes money as a middle-man buying electricity from generators and selling it to consumers. During the first quarter of this year Enron's revenues increased 281 percent to $50.1 billion. Asked about the purpose of the meeting Karen Denne a spokeswoman for Enron said she would look into that and then did not return repeated telephone calls seeking comment. One participant said Denne was present at the meeting. D.C. CONNECTIONS Meanwhile Lay's power in Washington is reported to have reached unprecedented heights. According to a story in yesterday's New York Times Lay supplied the Bush administration with a list of candidates for jobs regulating the power industry and even interviewed one of them. The story also said Lay essentially threatened to seek the removal of the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Curt Hebert if he does not support Lay's desire to further deregulate the nation's electricity system. Lay denied the allegation. Also in attendance at this week's meeting were Bruce Karatz chief executive of home builder Kaufman & Broad Ray Irani chief executive of Occidental Petroleum and Kevin Sharer chief executive of biotech giant Amgen. Among those who were invited but did not attend were former Los Angeles Lakers star Earvin Magic Johnson supermarket magnate and Bill Clinton supporter Ron Burkle and Dennis Tito recently returned from the world's first civilian space trip. Milken through a spokesman confirmed that he attended the meeting but declined to be interviewed. Schwarzenegger could not be reached for comment through a publicist and Sharer did not return a call yesterday afternoon. A spokesman for Riordan Peter Hidalgo said the Los Angeles mayor attended but was not intending to formulate any kind of policy position on this issue. His intent is to listen to all sides. Attached to the Enron handout was a two-page open letter addressed to Davis and the state Legislature apparently prepared for those who support Lay's position and would be willing to sign their names to it. The source who participated in the meeting said those assembled appeared noncommittal and asked a number of questions of Lay but did not agree to champion his agenda.

Currently Trailblazer is conducting an open season to expand its facilities for service between Wyoming and Gage County Nebraska. A number of our contacts in the Powder River (including ENA) are making decisions on Trailblazer capacity right now. When we invested in the Bighorn gas gathering project in December of 1999 we viewed a connection between Bighorn and Northern Border Pipeline (250miles) as a strategic advantage to be exploited in the future. Strong gas prices and the ramp of Powder River production are accelerating the feasibility of making a pipeline out of the Northern Powder River Basin a reality. While connecting the Powder River Basin to NBPL using an intrastate pipeline through Montana remains a real possibility it also carries with it the negative baggage of NBPL being fully contracted through 2003 (and possibly beyond) with Canadian gas and a potential for Alaskan gas. In the short term this presents us with some problems getting shippers to sign up for transport on the new Montana intrastate. I would like you to think about the following concept . A new interstate pipeline named NBP-Dakota extending from the Recluse Wyoming area to Ventura Iowa and going into service in November of 2003. A tentative design and cost would be 24 diameter 1435 MAOP 480 miles with capex of approximately $270 million. Initial flow would be 300 mmcfd with expansion capability up to 490 mmcfd and an initial rate of just under 50 cents per mcf Recluse to Ventura. At today's Ventura price of $4.22 this could leave Powder River producers a margin of more than $2.00 an mcf. Using August 1999 Ventura pricing of $2.64 the margin would be 64 cents. If we can build the pipeline at the cost projected (NPNG has used Fort Union's actual construction costs for a 24 inch 1440psi system - Enron Engineering would not even be in the same cost universe) NBP Dakota would be more competitive than sending the gas to NBPL via the Montana intrastate. I am of the opinion that future looping the Trailblazer system would come in as 3rd place to the other 2 routes. NBP Dakota would need to get started with an open season this fall to allow for a 2003 in-service date. THE QUESTION I need your opinion about using NBP Dakota for this opportunity rather than feeding more gas into NBPL in the northern Montana area. Strategically are we willing to let NBPL carry the possible risk of decontracting after 2003 without support from the Powder River Basin ? For what it may be worth I believe NBPL can handle that risk successfully without the Powder River volumes. I need to know your views on this as the Montana intrastate topic is coming up for discussion at the Bighorn Management Committee meeting later this summer.

SB 28x (Sher/Battin) makes various changes to the siting process including many IEP-sponsored proposals. As you will recall two new provisions were added to the bill at the last minute before going to the Assembly Floor dealing with both retrofit schedules and environmental dispatch of generating facilities. Per the direction from IEP member companies IEP has decided not to negotiate on the environmental dispatch issue. If the provision remained in the bill IEP would continue to push the Republicans to hold their opposed position. We were however given the authority to negotiate on the retrofit issue as long as we were only talking about facilities that already have retrofit requirements. I will be faxing out the agreed upon language which in essence says the ARB shall set a schedule for the completion of any mandated retrofits. It does not expand the authority of the air districts and ARB to mandate retrofits under existing law. The schedule would require completion of the retrofits by July 1 2004 or such later date as the ISO determines is necessary to maintain reliability. With these amendments including some clean-up language SB 28x will be voted-on on the Assembly floor on Monday and go to the Senate for concurrence on Tuesday. The final version will include the following IEP-sponsored proposals: ? Conforming the timing of offsets for power plants to Clean Air Act requirements ? Substituting CEQA-style hearings for the trial-like proceedings of the CE= C ? Streamlining the permit process for the modernization of existing power plant sites ? Giving consideration to the positive environmental impacts of a proposed project. ? Improving the timeliness and coordination of state and local agency review. ? Extending the current deadlines for the expedited review process established in AB 970. Since SB 28x is only a first step in making changes to the siting process IEP member should now be thinking about what is next. IEP proposals still on the table include: ? Permitting local agencies to make zoning changes or other decisions for power plants contingent upon CEC CEQA Compliance ? Giving deference to other state and regional agencies ? Easing the threshold for override of local land use requirements. ? Making the ISO responsible for determining interconnection requirements -- Bad news on the =01&California First=018 issue quickly followed the good= news. The CEC staff analysis which said the State can't require builders of new power plants to sell electricity here even as a trade-off for expedited permitting was countered by another staff analysis that says the state can= . Both documents cannot be obtained due to attorney-client privilege. This issue is coming to a head next week with a decision pending by the CEC to include a California First clause on the approval of an expedited AES power plant project. AB 60x (Hertzberg) which ties to the siting process the requirement that a developer enter into a contract to sell power to specified California entities is still poised to be heard in the Senate Energy committee. IEP members company lobbyist should continue to lobby against this measure regardless of the CEC=01s decision on AES although our arguments are definitely strengthened if the addition of the clause at the CEC is denied. -- IEP has finalized negotiations with Senator Burton=01s office on amendm= ents attempting to solve our problem with the eminent domain provision in SB 6x (Burton) which is the State Power Authority measure. Attached is a copy o= f the bill in PDF form. The agreed upon language which clarifies that the Authority=01s purpose is to supplement existing generation activities can= be found on pages 6-7 (Section 3310) 13 (Section 3341.1) and 16-17 (Section3352). Considering the inflammatory remarks made by Senator Burton in the press lately regarding seizing generation assets this was most likely the best we could get. -- The first of Senator Dunn=01s hearings with the Senate Select Committee= to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Market occurred this week. This week and next week=01s topics will be to go over previous investigati= ons into market power. The committee heard or will be hearing testimony from: Frank Wolak Chairman Market Surveillance Committee CAISO Eric Hildebrandt Manager Market Monitoring CAISO and Elaine Howle State Auditor. -- The Assembly Electricity Oversight Subcommittee met this week and focused on the issue of natural gas collusion. Testifying before the committee were representatives from Dynegy and El Paso commenting on the rise of natural gas prices and whether illegal market manipulation and collusion occurred. The subcommittee plans on putting together a package o= f bills related to natural gas issues which would be the culmination of the committee=01s hearings over the last two months. This package will be up = for consideration first by the whole special Assembly Energy committee. -- Governor Davis came out this week supporting the construction of the Calpine Metcalf Energy Center the 600-megawatt power plant proposed for th= e San Jose region. The Governor urged the CEC to approve the plant siting so that construction can begin. -- Two long-term contracting bills are scheduled for hearings next week. IEP counsel is currently reviewing AB 57 (Wright) and SB 997 (Morrow) and will comment on their provisions as soon as possible. -- Attached is the most recent legislative tracking reports both the special session and regular session.

Key question is who will pay the Negative CTC overpayment? On trying to understand the PX Credit algorithim my concern is that to understand how much the overpayment was during Oct - Feb we need to understand how costs hit the structure during that time period.

Following discussions with the Prime Minister's office and a quick check with venues 31 October is firming up as the preferred date for a meeting with the Prime Minister and an office opening by the PM. Jeff Skilling Visit. The Nikkei and the Tokyo University have now made the decision to invite Mr Skilling to give the key note address at the symposium on 26 November in Tokyo. As mentioned the symposium is the most prestigious conference on IT in Japan. While the conference itself receives significant media attention the President of Nikkei has offered to interview Mr Skilling. This honour is usually reserved for Heads of State. The interview will be featured on the front page of the Nikkei and picked up by other major media services. kind regards Nicholas O'Day 08/29/2000 07:43 PM To: Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES Rosalee Fleming/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: John Mark Schroeder/LON/ECT@ECT Joseph P Hirl/AP/ENRON@ENRON Mika Watanabe/AP/Enron Takashi Kimura/AP/Enron Subject: Re: Ken Lay meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Ken Lay Visit. Balancing the need to push out the arrangement of high level meetings as far as possible with the desire to have a meeting with Prime Minister Mori prior to the US Presidential election the week commencing 30 October would be the optimum time for a visit by Mr Lay. PM Mori is generally available in that week. We will get a preferred time from the PM's chief secretary first thing tomorrow morning Tokyo time. Jeff Skilling Visit. The boards of Nikkei and Tokyo University Institute of Advanced Studies have yet to make a decision on the key note speaker for the one day invitation only seminar to be held on 26 October. As mentioned the boards will choose between the chairman of Cisco and Jeff Skilling. The conference is focused on the IT revolution and an invitation only event for approximately 600 of Japan's corporate leaders. The speaking panel and topics for discussion will be developed around the key note speaker. If Mr Skilling were to give the key note speech it is likely that key senior Government Ministers would be asked to present at the seminar. Following the Prime Minister's commitment at the Okinawa summit of US$15billion expenditure in the region on IT infrastructure and education Japan's focus on e-commerce is almost reaching fever pitch. There will be significant interest in the conference from senior levels of Government and the business community. Further as you would expect with the involvement of the Nikkei there is typically significant media coverage associated with the key note speaker's presentation. kind regards [/INST] Category: Logistic Arrangements(meeting scheduling, technical support, etc)"

The other congressional participants were staff to Reps. Steve Largent and Chip Pickering. After meeting all week (except Wednesday) the group was unable to reach an agreement or even a provisional consensus on what could be placed in an electricity title that could be added to the comprehensive energy package that the House Energy and Commerce Committee will begin to process next week. Congressional staff will report to their bosses on the status of the discussions as of this afternoon and from there the Members will determine whether to proceed further. There is a general perception that committee leaders will elect NOT to take up electricty legislation at this time and in the context of the broader package in the absence of broadly supported legislation. In the end the discussions did not bear fruit because divisions remained over the usual issues and along most of the usual fault lines. As the drafts progressed during the week we succeeded in deleting the original language that would have had Congress weigh into the bundled/unbundled and federa/state jurisdictional rules at the very time that likely adverse action in Congress could in turn adversely impact the Supreme Court case. A last minute attempt was made by the congressional staff to stitch together a minimalist electricity title that would have included reliability (with the understanding that the NERC discussions could produce modifications more to our liking) PUHCA repeal PURPA reform interconnection language and federal siting. However in each instance there were one more politically relevant interest groups not willing to go along. Cong. DeLay's staff also tried to link PUHCA repeal to those who had joined an RTO. There was also an attempt to strip it down to reliability interconnection and siting (eminent domain) -- but again there was either disagreement on the details or objection from those who favorite subject was left out of the minimalist package. There was one rather interesting discussion when the public power folks floated language on market power that included a sentence that would have made the filed rate doctrine inapplicable to antitrust challenges to market rates. Needless to say I strongly objected as did EPSA and others. As noted the lack of an agreement reduces our exposure when the mark up occurs. In the absence of an electricity title refund price control and other issues should not be germane to the package that the subcommittee will take up on Tuesday and the full committee next Friday. That package will have five issues addressed: conservation clean coal hyrdo nuclear and reformulated gasoline. Details to follow once legislative language is released.

From: Bill Donovan@ECT on 05/17/2001 03:29 PM To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron Maureen McVicker/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: Weekly Notes Steve - I will be taking this Friday the 18th off on vacation. Here are notes for your staff meeting. Buyer/Seller have executed Offer Letter on Falcon EX ($32750000 price). Aircraft goes to pre-purchase inspection this weekend. Close is no later than June 6th. All indications are that buyer is very motivated to complete the deal. Enron Center South (ECS) Project remains solidly on track. We are 10 weeks out on initial occupancy with Level 3 occupancy (EGM moves Aug. 3rd). Levels 4 (EIM ENW & Credit.Com) occupies two weeks later (Aug. 17). Level 5 (Power) occupies two weeks after (Aug. 31st - Labor Day weekend). Level 6 (Gas) occupies two weeks after (Sept. 14th). Level 7 (Executive) and the 1st floor public spaces occupies year end. Level 2 (Cafeteria) opens Nov. Found a Law firm interested in Azurix's present space in Three Allen Center (3 floors). Goal is cut deal and have them in by year end. Enron Broadband indicates an intent to remain on their present ECN floors (Levels 44 and 45) plus backfill balance of operations into Wholesale's vacated trading floors. This splits them into two elevator banks and becomes problematic for ETS - who wants continuous floors ECN Levels 39 through 46. We are seeking subtenants for Broadband's Portland office space. They plan to vacate the Riverplace building by Oct. Negotiating new food service contract with Sedexo Marriott to add ECS cafeteria. Total compensation will be based on 3% fee on gross revenue - only on individual sales of $2 or more (promote greater # of meals served) and bonus based on sharing of net operating income with Enron. Global Sourcing is participating with us in negotiations. Need to decide if Executive Car Care program is going to be continued (30 executives participate with employee paying $70 per month and business units subsidizing $275 per month). Decision needed because new Garage will require $60K in improvements to get set up for car washing. Present lease on remote car washing facility (@ $5k per month) expired and we are on month to month holdover. We are two weeks out to close on Beltway 8 land deal ($1.7 purchase price). Real estate being acquired for construction of new $18 mill. Data Center and Disaster Recovery Facility.

The proceeding was somewhat productive but turned into a witch hunt at a couple of points. Our view on this is: the problem is fairly straightforward (demand increases and new supplies are inhibited so prices go up and shortages ensue ... sound familiar?) and the solutions are straightforward (site the power plants suppliers are begging to build let the utilities hedge outside the exchange and finish the job of opening the interstate grid so power can get from where it is to where it is needed). What it comes down to at this point is FERC is the only entity with the authority to start fixing this problem now: Congress isn't going to get anything done this year and the California legislature is (thankfully) out of session now. Our political leaders need to give FERC the room they need to act. Good luck on your speech and give me a call sometime.

The EPSA staff draft of a letter to Barton on his RTO discussion proposal will be significantly strengthened and EPSA staff will start by incorporating the comments I sent over earlier in the week. The original draft said the Barton RTO language only needed technical corrections. EPSA staff reiterated that some member co. or cos. think Barton's draft could have been worse. My reply was this logic was like saying we should be grateful he shot us in the head instead of hanging us -- one method may be more humane but either way we are dead (OK the analogy may be too rough -- but it made the point.) (I subsequently confirmed that Reliant is the soft member -- their rep. told me they support the discussion draft although they wouldn't object if it is strengthened.) A stronger EPSA letter with more specific reasons why we oppose the Barton discussion draft will be circulated among EPSA members today or Monday with the goal of sending the letter first thing Tuesday when Congress returns. Some wanted a general letter requesting a meeting and deferring specific comments until the meeting. I pointed out that Barton is speaking to subcommittee members right now and that we needed to copy them on a more detailed letter ASAP so they hear from us before Barton gets to them. We will make the same contacts ourselves. In fact we have already started. Spoke to Reps. Chip Pickering and Rep. Greg Walden both subcommittee Republicans this week (did same with staff to Rep. John Shimkus). Key task when House staff return to work on Tuesday will be finding out where Ranking Member Rick Boucher is on the Barton RTO draft. Barton implied at a conference earlier this week that he and Boucher are in agreement on RTOs. [/INST] Category: Company Business, Strategy, etc.(elaborate in Section 3 [Topics])"

The NEPD Group (National Energy Policy Development) recommends that the President direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to propose multi-pollutant legislation. The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct the EPA Administrator to work with Congress to propose legislation that would establish a flexible market-based program to significantly reduce and cap emissions fo sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides and mercury from electric power generators. Such a program (with appropriate measures to address local concerns) would provide significant public health benefits even as we increase electricity supplies. Establish mandatory reduction targets to emissions of three main pollutants: sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides and mercury. Phase in reductions over a reasonable period of time similar to the successful acid rain reduction program established by the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act. Provide regulatory certainty to allow utilities to make modifications to their plants without fear of new litigation. Provide market-based incentives such as emissions trading credits to help achieve the required reductions. The NEPD Group recognizes the importance of looking to technology to help us meet the goals of increasing electricity generation while protecting our environment. To that end the NEPD Group recommends that the President direct the Department of Energy to continue to develop advanced clean coal technology by: Investing $2 billion over 10 years to fund research in clean coal technologies. Supporting a permanent extension of the existing research and development tax credit. Directing federal agencies to explore regulatory approaches that will encourage advancements in environmental technology. The NEPD Group recomemnds that the President direct federal agencies to provide greater regulatory certainty relating to coal electricity generation through clear policies that are easily applied to business decisions. The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in consultation with the Secretary of Energy and other relevant agencies to review New Source Review regulations including administrative interpretations and implementation and report to the President within 90 days on the impact of the regulations on investment in new utility and refinery generation capacity energy efficiency and environmental protection. The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct the Attorney General to review existing enforcement actions regarding New Source Review to ensure that the enforcement actions are consistent with the Clean Air Act and its regulations. The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct federal agencies to support continued research into global climate change continue efforts to identify environmentally and cost-effective ways to use market mechanisms and incentives continue development of new technologies and cooperate with allies including through international processes to develop technologies market-based incentives and other innovative approaches to address the issue of global climate change.

For the speaking engagement next Wednesday I would like you to focus upon the Enron strategic model of virtual integration of market forces in the evolution of energy development. Wyoming represents a huge material resource base and the commission is charged with the development and promotion of such. But the Governor's message is that we cannot see ourselves as producers and exporters in the traditional sense. We will continue to have the status of a colony if we do not recognize the new dynamics of how these market places are evolving. If you set the stage with a presentation of Enron strategy then we will discuss how a state with its agencies and auathority can play a role in this evolution. I have set your time for 45 minutes which can include a short Qand A period. But your message can be as succint as you can make it and get the point across. You may have to present the Enron case a number of different ways but the Governor will give you latitude to make the point. You will be welcome to participate in a following panel which will address role playing by the state and the commission. Plan to join us for lunch. If you need more detail let me know. Thanks!

The star witness was Gov. Davis. Others were Govs. Martz of Montana and Hoeven of North Dakota against price caps Sens. Murkowski Murray and Cantwell Washington State's attorney general Oregon's PUC chairman and the five FERC commissioners. Once Davis left after several hours of testimony and two rounds of questions most of the press and audience left. Enron was mentioned several times as follows: 1. Sen. Thompson the Ranking Republican mentioned Lockyer's Spike comments in the context of asking Gov. Davis about why business would make new investments in the state when on top of the regulatory uncertainty there is the broader political hostility expressed in this way by state officials. Davis had two chances to disavow Lockyer and did not. (Thompson gave him a second chance when he basically repeated the question and made specific reference again to Spike asking Davis if FERC acted this week because of the AG's Spike comments.) The first time Davis said that the people he represents are mad they want him to fight back this is rough business the industry people are used to a wildcatter's environment things occassionally get out of hand and we are not going to take it. On the second instance he said that the state was building new power plants and investment was not being diminished. 2. Sen. Bennett (R-UT) did an excellent job questioning Gov. Davis about his handling of the situation using quotes from California newspapers to make the case that Davis was slow to act. He also argued that the state had done a bad job as a power purchaser contrasting the state's recent 8-year contract with Constellation for power at $150 peak and $59 off-peak with Enron's willingness last year to sell them power for five years at $50. The Republicans also pressed Davis on why he attacks out-of-state generators but is not nearly as vocal about California munis who charged even more. Davis said they should make refunds too. 3. While not saying Enron by name Gov. Davis did make a comment about companies with trading floors that compete with the New York Stock Exchange with meteorologists and very talented people who might have the ability to find loopholes in the new order. He said this in answer to a question about what FERC needed to do now that the new order was issued and he said watch out for manipulation by those subject to the order. 4. Sen. Thompson pressed Washington State AG Gregoire about why she appeared to be investigating out-of-state suppliers even though they had a small percentage of the market in her state with lots of document requests and other investigative action while not doing the same to others. During that exchange either Thompson or the AG (I think it was the AG) said Enron had over $1 billion in sales to Washington State. Enron was not on the list of companies Thompson or the AG said were subject to her information demands. She said she would be expanding her inquiry though. Highlights and Analysis 1. As started at yesterday's Senate Energy hearing the mantra from the Western Democrats was: we want our money back. Chairman Lieberman and others pressed FERC about how California could get refunds and the same in other Western states particularly Oregon and Washington. Chairman Hebert said that the settlement conference process would allow all parties to raise all issues including refunds in California and outside California. He said that the conference could include issues that the commission could not act on itself including refunds not otherwise allowed under the Federal Power Act. Chairman Lieberman vowed to keep the committee active in overseeing FERC's activities in implementing the new order particularly as it relates to refunds. While he acknowledged that new legislation could not apply to pending cases he seemed inclined to pursue legislation to repeal the 60 day delay in the Federal Power Act relating to refunds. 2. Commissioner Wood spoke of the need to increase the penalities and enforcement tools available to the commission including the ability to order short suspensions of authority for regulated entities to transact business treble damages and other administrative penalties. There was also discussion among the committee and commissioners about beefing up FERC's market monitoring capabilities so that it acted more like the SEC FCC and FTC than it has in the past. 3. The Democrats on the committee and among the witnesses said that FERC's latest order is a step in the right direction. None of them called for legislative action on price caps as proposed by Sens. Feinstein and Smith. Sen. Murkowski had done a good job of taking the wind out of the legislated price cap sails by saying at the start of the hearing when he testified that the bill's sponsors had pulled back from swift action when they spoke at yesterday's hearing. Davis did say the still thinks that cost-based rates are better but he said the new order is some price relief and that it corrected the mistakes in the April order. 4. There was some discussion of natural gas again. Davis said that FERC should now turn its attention to natural gas. He said that El Paso controlled too much of the capacity until recently. He called on FERC to enforce laws against price manipulation. (Note: we have had several back channel reports that the Lieberman committee intends to look into the El Paso and Williams cases now at FERC about alleged affiliate issues.) 5. There was some discussion of the termination of the new FERC order. Lieberman pressed several witnesses about whether Sept. 2002 is too soon. Davis said it was and that they needed at least until the end of 2002 if not more time and that order should apply until California has enough new generation in place. Hebert did not back down when pressed by Lieberman later in the hearing saying there needs to be a deadline to get action on new supplies however he and the others basically said they would revisit the issue if events warrant. 6. Several times Sen. Lieberman and others said they generally support deregulation but that the effort to get more states to do so will never happen if the price situation is not brought under control and public confidence restored. 7. Gov. Davis did throw a few kind words toward Pres. Bush and Pat Wood saying that each was open to doing more about the high cost of natural gas to California including the possible reimposition of rate regulation of transportation to California. He said he liked Pat Wood and he noted that FERC did not take serious price mitigation action until the two new Bush appointees were on the commission. 8. Lieberman asked the Washington State AG whether the Justice Dept. or the FTC were doing anything to address high energy prices. She said not to her knowledge even though she has asked them to do so. We can expect a Lieberman et al request for Justice and FTC involvement going forward I suspect. 9. While Chairman Lieberman's tone and closing comments were in the nature of his normal thoughtful tone it is clear that he and others see this as a major issue for them to ride. He commended FERC at the end of the hearing for doing their best but pledged he would stay involved closing the session with a smile and the words see you soon.

Yesterday I spoke with Mark Bennett and Donn Salvosa of the EPSA staff. Mark did the talking. The upshot is that EPSA and EEI are meeting to see if they can't agree on reliability legislation. EEI is working off of the NERC draft and has sent a version to EPSA dated 9/14 (see attached) that was the basis for last Thursday's meeting. EPSA is now doing some drafting of its own. I need to read the 9/14 draft but the fact that they are working off of the old NERC language is of considerable concern. EPSA staff emphasizes the value of having EEI off the NERC reservation (which is good in terms of showing that there is NERC consensus) but I think EPSA staff may be too flexible in how they are approaching it. I reminded them of our position and concerns and of Jim's prepared statement on EPSA's behalf filed for the Sept. 11 Barton hearing. EPSA staff claims that other EPSA members are OK with them embarking on this project. It is not clear if this effort will succeed. EPSA staff said EEI's board insists on having engineers do reliability which is objectionable to EPSA. EPSA staff seems to think that some type of reliablity SRO is inevitable and that it is wise to get the best one they can. I will check with some other EPSA members.

When you stopped by my office about 18 months ago you asked if I had any students that might be appropriate for your group. Although I didn't at the time now I do. This student has excellent technical skills including an M.S. in Statistics and a Ph.D. in Economics by the end of the current academic year. His dissertation research is on the investment behavior of Independent Power Producers in the US. As a result of research assistance he has done for me he knows the California market very well and is familiar with the other ISOs. I think he would be an excellent match for you.

Keep the presentations by the officers . . . to talk about the business. I liked having other people from ETS/Enron there to better understand the big picture and where Enron is going. Continue to bring in invited guests to keep the group apprised of Corporate activities. I liked the opportunity to hear both Stan and Steve--the field staff don't get as many opportunities to hear from corporate management. Visits by Steve Kean and Stan Horton.

Stephen D Burns@ENRON 07/19/2000 01:47 AM To: Richard Shapiro/HOU/EES@EES James D Steffes/HOU/EES@EES cc: Scott Bolton/Enron Communications@Enron Communications Joe Hillings/Corp/Enron@ENRON Chris Long/Corp/Enron@ENRON (bcc: Steven J Kean/HOU/EES) Subject: BLM/Forest Service Right-of-Way Update The Senate voted on the Interior Appropriations Bill late yesterday. Our amendment passed which prevents either BLM or the Forest Service from enacting new fiber optic federal lands rights-of-way policies. The BLM made a last ditch effort to defeat this in the Senate but we had reached key Senators and staff and they got nowhere. Action now moves to Conference which for us means a focus on the House Conference members. Scott and I will spend the next 2 days meeting with the key Republicans in the House. We've already recruited the important Democrats. Interior Approps Subcommittee Chairman Regula remains opposed at least publicly but we think we can get other Members to swing him. We trust he'll come up with a sensible face saving compromise on his own eg formally beginning a review process with his Subcommittee having oversight -- at this point our language literally forbids BLM or Forest Service from even meeting to discuss the issue. We continue though on several other fronts: 1. We have the New Dems writing OMB on the issue and several Senators and Congressmen writing BLM and USFS 2. We've increased the pressure on the White House and are letting them know through very senior back door channels that in our opinion BLM/Forest Service have not gotten the message. Our position is that we'll be satisfied that they've changed their evil ways when the new assessment on the Mt. Hood EBS build is retracted. 3. We're preparing both Senate and House authorizing Committees for the longer-term issue next session. We have no trouble finding champtions eager to own the issue 4. We're engaging the Western Caucus for same 5. Our adhoc coalition continues to grow in numbers and clout with over 20 companies and associations now actively engaged. Enron chairs this initiative with a tangible side benefit being much increased visibility and stature as a serious communications player. 6. Scott is successfully engaging state and local officials to weigh in from the end-user perspective BLM is on the retreat and has asked for a meeting which we've refused. We don't think they've given up though and it's likely an issue of pride at this point. So until the Approps process concludes we're continuing with the full court press.

Proposes to replace ISO and PX boards with independent non-stakeholde= r=20 boards. 2.? Continued significant role for the presidents of PX/ISO who should be= =20 made voting members. 3.? Elimination of mandated buy-sell requirement for the IOUs (although no= =20 explanation as to whether this requires CPUC action). Over-reliance on spo= t=20 markets has been problematical. 4.?

However the generator will be required to=20 provide confidential reports to FERC explaining the necessity for bids ove= r=20 $150 through 12/31/02. 6.? The order requires forward scheduling of 95% of an scheduling =20 coordinator=01s schedule with a penalty applied for deviations which exce= ed 5%=20 As an incentive the proceeds of the penalties go to the schedulers who=20 comply with the tolerance band. 7.? Rejects the purchase price caps proposed by the ISO. The order would= =20 eliminate the ISO=01s price cap authority. 8.? Beginning 1/1/01 the prospect of refunds will be available. =20 ? Commissioner Hebert ? Due to a technical problem when I called in I heard only part of his =20 remarks. He announced that he will have a separate concurrence in the order= =20 but is troubled by some of its features. The $150 cap is questionable=20 whether described as a Soft cap or as a hard cap. His concern is that it will clearly discourage new investment in generatio= n.=20 He therefore recommended that the $150 cap should be escalated on a regula= r=20 basis (perhaps every six months) until it reaches at least $250.=20 ? He points out that the ISO and PX are required to make RTO filings to FERC = =20 on 1/16/01. These filings should address the major aspects of the Order=20 issued today.=20 ? Hebert also questioned the issue of refunds alleging that it was =20 disingenuous to suggests that refunds were a possible remedy.=20 ? Commissioner Breathitt=20 ? Breathitt announced almost all of the foregoing major points of the orderT= he=20 order is based on a market approach. In choosing our market-based approac= h=20 it is our goal to guide the markets to self-correct and not re-institute= =20 command and control regulation.? We have all worked too hard too long t= o=20 have this result. ? Commissioner Massey ? Sixty-five years ago the Congress decreed that prices had to be just and = =20 reasonable.? There is no exception for market-based approaches. He will =20 concur as the order does find that prices have been unjust and=20 unreasonable. The order does insure that prices should return to being jus= t=20 and reasonable. Cited Frank Wolak as proposing there ought to be an 18-24= =20 month forward product designed which the CPUC will years ago federal law= =20 dictated that prices had to be just and reasonable. The $150 is a soft cap and allows a generator to bid above it but if it= =20 does it will not set the price which other generators receive.

Under Steve Hopper's leadership the Chorety spill became a non-issue by Friday. During the crisis I collaborated with my counterpart from Shell/London Michael Megarry in developing a Key Messages and Internal Q&As document (attached). At the daily meeting/conference call there was an Operations Report from the site an analysis of the day's newspaper articles (which I handled) and discussions on how to respond to media that were reporting or airing inaccurate information that was damaging Transredes' image. I also developed a Stakeholders Action Plan (attached) for the Incident Commander to use in organizing and monitoring team member actions taken in response to stakeholder concerns. The Plan was updated daily by the Transredes PR Office and given to team members prior to every meeting/conference call. The Stakeholder Report is intended to complement the Operations Report. I also want to acknowledge the support of Karen and Dennis during the early stages of the crisis. It was extremely helpful.

He agrees to be available and cooperative with Enron and its counsel regarding litigation matters. He will agree to meet with counsel prepare for testimony review documents testify and provide other assistance as needed. 2. Through February 1 2001 Kevin would not be directly compensated for this cooperation/testimony (because he is to be receiving his salary pursuant to the terms of his employment agreement). After Feb.1 2001 he will be paid a rate of $125 per hour for his services in this regard. 3. Enron would agree to indemnify Kevin for his conduct taken in the ordinary course and scope of his employment with Enron up to the last date of his employment with Enron. Excluded from this indemnity would be allegations or claims based upon the following: -- any conduct that is outside the course and scope of Kevin's employment -- any conduct violating policies of Enron or ENA -- Kevin's intentional acts -- Kevin's gross negligence -- Kevin's reckless conduct -- conduct that is in violation of any law statute regulation or other legal obligation or -- the commission of an unlawful or illegal act. 4. Kevin would invoice Enron for time spent in performing the services after 2/1/01. The invoice would be paid within 30 days of receipt. In addition all related expenses would be reimbursed throughout the term of the agreement. Let me know if you have any questions or require additional information.

While it is highly objectionable and our goal is to kill it to do so we need to respond to requests to be specific about why we don't like it. One of the more objectionable provisions says that FERC can't change the scope governance etc. of any RTO that has been approved under Order 2000 prior to enactment of the legislation. If this applies to PJM the legislation would stop the Northeast-wide RTO in its tracks since several of you and PJM's Phil Harris testified last week that FERC has approved PJM. By contrast committee staff and the section-by-section they distributed on the RTO legislative proposal say that to date FERC has NOT approved any RTOs under Order 2000. They say that the legislative language would not apply to any RTO as of this date because FERC approvals of PJM Cal ISO and NePool have been approved under the ISO principles of Order 888. Your thoughts on the above would be helpful. Either way I think we can argue that the provision shows why the Barton proposal is a retrenchment rather than an advancement on RTOs. If it does not apply to PJM and the others as they contend there is no good reason to include it other than to freeze the process at FERC merely by having the legislation pending on the Hill much less enacted into law.

The only problem I see is that we would need a decision from the top that we're not going to turn the customers back if we get direct access (so we can end the debate). I don't think it helps us if we get lucky get direct access back then make a decision to return customers to the utility.

I strongly believe that the public hit we will take will be far greater than our actual out-of-pocket losses. We will be crucified by the public media consumer groups legislators governor attorney general etc. and this action will reaffirm our reputation of packing up and leaving when it's not in our interest. The impact of this action would be exacerbated since it is on the heels of UC/CSU. I would also argue that this hurts our national dereg efforts. If we're advocating that competition and choice benefits consumers and then we turn around and pull out of a market and abandon customers when we're not profiting we'll kill any chances we have of ever serving retail customers in California -- or in any other state. We look foolish advocating for direct access when we're not willing to serve our existing -- let alone future customers What about a preemptive strike that engages these 16000 customers to weigh in on direct access -- i.e. a letter that says Enron may be forced to cancel its contract -- call/write/send the enclosed postcard to your legislator and tell them you want to keep your right to choose your energy service provider. Our credibility is on the line. Before we take this action we need to be cognizant of all the long-range strategic implications and we need to seriously weigh the negative impact this will have on our corporate reputation on our legislative abilities and on our commercial success going forward. kd James D Steffes 04/12/2001 09:05 PM To: Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT Sandra McCubbin/NA/Enron@Enron Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron Janel Guerrero/Corp/Enron@Enron Mark Palmer/Corp/Enron@ENRON Karen Denne/Corp/Enron@ENRON Susan J Mara/NA/Enron Peggy Mahoney/HOU/EES@EES Harry Kingerski/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Dan Leff/HOU/EES@EES Subject: CONFIDENTIAL - Residential in CA In the meeting today no decision was made about what to do with Enron's 16000 residential customers. Each of the contracts gives a basic 30 day out right to Enron. That being said I think that we have a short window to push for DA before any public action impacts us in Sacramento. I realize that the ultimate action (which I think is inevitable) makes it harder for our advocacy on DA but real $ are flowing out of the company. EES will give us notice when a decision is reached.

The Real Wolf RECKONINGS By PAUL KRUGMAN ecently I received a letter from an economist I respect chiding me for my Naderite columns on the California energy crisis. He just didn't believe that market manipulation by power companies could possibly be an important issue it sounded too much to him like the sort of thing one hears from knee-jerk leftists who blame greedy capitalists for every problem be it third-world poverty or high apartment rents. The left has cried Wolf! so many times that sensible people have learned to discount such claims. But now a bona fide wolf has arrived whose predatory behavior is doing terrible damage to our most populous state - and nobody will believe it. True California would be heading for a summer of power shortages even if it had never deregulated. And even if there was workable competition in the wholesale electricity market prices in that market would spike during periods of peak demand transferring billions of dollars from either taxpayers or consumers to the generators. But the evidence is now overwhelming that there isn't workable competition in California's power market and that the actions of generators gaming the system have greatly magnified the crisis. The key fact is that California has somehow remained in a state of more or less continuous power shortage and very high wholesale prices regardless of the level of demand. A rash of outages has kept the electricity market conveniently - and very profitably - short of supply even during periods of low demand when there ought to be lots of excess capacity. As Frank Wolak the Stanford economist who also advises the state's power grid has pointed out an outage at a power plant is a lot like an employee calling in sick. You can't tell directly whether he is really sick or has chosen to take the day off for other reasons but you can look for circumstantial evidence. And such evidence has convinced Mr. Wolak that generators use forced outages strategically to withhold capacity from the market - a view shared by a growing number of other researchers. Which brings us to the latest move by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. On Wednesday the commission apparently decided to offer California some relief and put new price caps in place on the California electricity market. I say apparently because the more you look at the plan the less likely it seems to be any help at all. Indeed the measure was passed on a 2-to-1 vote with William Massey - the one commissioner who has been sympathetic to calls for price controls - voting against it on the grounds that it would be ineffectual. What's wrong with FERC's plan? First it caps prices only in emergency conditions - ignoring the fact that electricity prices have stayed at hard- to-explain levels even when there is no emergency. In effect the plan is laid out as if the electricity market were really competitive in spite of all the evidence that it is not. Second even those emergency price caps are full of loopholes offering extensive opportunities for what Mr. Wolak calls megawatt laundering - selling power to affiliated companies that for one reason or another are exempted from the price controls (for example the controls do not apply to imports from neighboring states) then selling it back into the California market. Severin Borenstein of the University of California Energy Institute adds that because the allowed price depends on the cost of generation at the least efficient plant generators will have a clear incentive to produce inefficiently: I predict we will find some plants we never heard of before that are suddenly operating again and they will be pretty inefficient. The general verdict seems to be that this is not a serious plan. There are serious proposals to mitigate the crisis out there - indeed last fall Mr. Wolak submitted a proposal that was well received by other experts - but FERC has ignored all of them. The charitable interpretation is that FERC still doesn't get it that it just can't bring itself to believe that this time the wolf is real. The uncharitable interpretation is that last week's action was meant to fail. The Medley Report an online newsletter calls the FERC plan a grand exercise in posturing without substance . . . a very clever temporary move by the Bush administration to deflect any political fallout from the looming disaster. Whatever the explanation the plain fact is that FERC and the administration have yet to offer California any significant relief.

Michelle Enron North America Corp. From: Felecia Acevedo @ ENRON 11/02/2000 08:56 AM To: Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Re: Privileged and Confidential communication to my attorneys Michelle who is GSP? Are they a legal entity? Are they on our payroll? If they are we filed EEO-1's for them. Below is the criteria to file an EEO-1 report: Standard Form 100 must be filed by - A. All private employers who are: (1) subject to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (as amended by the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972) with 100 or more employees EXCLUDING State and local governments primary and secondary school systems institutions of higher education Indian tribes and tax-exempt private membership clubs other than labor organizations OR (2) subject to Title VII who have fewer than 100 employees if the company is owned or affiliated with another company or there is centralized ownership control or management (such as central control of personnel policies and labor relations) so that the group legally constitutes a single enterprise and the entire enterprise employs a total of 100 or more employees. B. All federal contractors (private employers) who: (1) are not exempt as provided for by 41 CFR 60-1.5 (2) have 50 or more employees and (a) are prime contractors or first-tier subcontractors and have a contract subcontract or purchase order amounting to $50000 or more or (b) serve as a depository of Government funds in any amount or (c) is a financial institution which is an issuing and paying agent for U.S. Savings Bonds and Notes. All multi-establishment employers i.e. employers doing business at more than one establishment must file: (1) a report covering the principal or headquarters office (2) a separate report for each establishment employing 50 or more persons (3) a consolidated report that MUST include ALL employees by race sex and job category in establishments with 50 or more employees as well as establishments with fewer than 50 employees and (4) a list showing the name address total employment and major activity for each establishment employ-ing fewer than 50 persons must accompany the consolidated report. All forms for a multi-establishment company must be collected by the headquarters office for its establishments or by the parent corporation for its subsidiary holdings and submitted in one package. For the purposes of this report the term parent corporation refers to any corporation which owns all or the majority stock of another corporation so that the latter stands in the relation to it of a subsidiary. The OFCCP has always held that subsidiary companies that do not have direct govt contracts must comply with AAP regulations if the parent company or other subsidiary companies benefit from government contracts. Their line of thought is that the subsidiary without government contracts benefits indirectly from the contract as well. If GSP is completely free standing and they do not participate in Enron's benefits abide by our policies or procedures  participate in our bonus process that may partially or wholly be funded by Enron Corp.  etc. they may have some type of argement not to comply but I doubt it. If we own them over 51% I don't see a way they could not file EEO-1's and have an AAP. We do all the AAP's in Corporate so if this is a freestanding Business Unit I need to know. Thanks!

House hearing was in the Barton Subcommittee (Energy & Air Quality). Senate hearing was on last week's FERC order on a soft price cap and related issues. The House witnesses were dominated by California officials: Cal Energy Commission Cal Air Resources Board Chairman of Gov Davis Generation Implementation Task Force. In addition there were witnesses from the Western Area Power Admin and Bonneville PA. The Senate witnesses were the three FERC commissioners. HIghlights Chairman Barton said it is still his intention to try to mark up the Barton bill H.R. 1647 next week (many on and off the Subcommittee doubt this will happen we are gathering political intelligence on those prospects and will report back with more information and conclusions once that is done) Chairman Barton also said he may go to California next week. There was considerable emphasis at both hearings about the alleged role that higher natural gas prices into California play in the electric power rate increases several witnesses focused on difference in alleged transportation costs for similar differences between California and non-CA states FERC at the Senate hearing said that today the commission announced a staff technical conference for later this month on all aspects of the natural gas market as it relates to California a House member from Southern Illinois coal country attacked California for using only natural gas in its new power plants. The House witnesses primarily BPA but also the California witnesses attacked the negawatt provision in sec. 102 of the Barton bill the criticism was that BPA would be forced to purchase power on the open market at a high price since it is short sell it to the DSIs under contract let the DSI sell it at market rates and capture the difference BPA witness said that thus sec. 102 would make it difficult if not impossible to implement their strategy to avoid as much as a 200 percent rate increase on 10/1/01 BPA testimony will make it tough for Members of Congress from that service region to support sec. 102. Both hearings also touched on how difficult it would be to actually devise a price cap at the House hearing none of those advocating a price cap among the witnesses could answer excellent questions about exactly how this could be done the witnesses just said cost plus a reasonable profit and said leave the details to FERC at afternoon Senate hearing Chairman Hebert had the staff bring in 15 boxes from one FP&L case to show how a price cap would take too long to bring any relief to California this summer he said last week's soft price cap is much better. Also on the price cap Rep. Walden (R-OR) got the Cal Energy Comm chair to admit that if the price caps had been in place earlier California would NOT have taken the conservation and new generation steps that it has taken recently. The interplay among the FERC commissioners was much more contentious than it was a House hearing on Tuesday although it could have been worse when Senate Chairman Murkowski (R-AK) said that help is on the way in the form of the nominees for the two vacancies Sen. Dorgan (D-ND) made a comment that suggested that the confirmation process will not be smooth the same concern came from the interplay among the Senators which was also somewhat contentious at times. Please advise if you have any questions or would like further details. [/INST] Category: Company Business, Strategy, etc.(elaborate in Section 3 [Topics])"

I know you have a thousand other things on your plate not the least of which is California so I understand if the answer is no. However they've been contacted by someone else about the date so we may be forced to decide rather soon. On a related subject I'm contemplating another topic for the conference. I'd seen an article in Fortune several months ago titled Managing for the Slowdown. It talked about new challenges managers face in light of the economic downturn. (Most young managers have never experienced anything but boom times.) The article also outlines a dozen or so things companies should be thinking about now. (Use the downturn as a new opportunity to evaluate people. Overhaul your budget process. Don't stop communicating. etc.) I think it would be beneficial to address similar strategies and ideas with our managers. I'd love to get your thoughts on this idea.

PDT. AT ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME TIME CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR INITIATED ROLLING BLACKOUTS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE MARCH. COINCIDENCE? PROBABLY BUT THE CONNECTION SHOULDN'T BE IGNORED. THE POLICY DECISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ADOPTED IN CALIFORNIA TO DATE HAVE ACCELERATED AN ALREADY SERIOUS MARKET COLLAPSE SAID A HARVARD UNIVERSITY STUDY OF CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY CRISIS LATE LAST MONTH. THIS WEEK'S WINDFALL-PROFITS TAX BILL IS THE LATEST BLUNT INSTRUMENT WIELDED WITH POTENTIALLY DISASTROUS RESULTS. GOV. GRAY DAVIS WANTED IT AS A STICK WHEN (CONT) MEETING WITH EXECUTIVES FROM THE STATE'S MERCHANT POWER COMPANIES WEDNESDAY. THE MANEUVER WAS LESS THAN ADROIT AND THE GENERATORS WEREN'T IMPRESSED. AFTER THE MEETING WITH DAVIS RELIANT ENERGY'S (REI) JOHN STOUT SAID THAT IF THE TAX WERE IMPLEMENTED IN CALIFORNIA IT WOULD INSTANTLY BLACK OUT ALL THE GENERATION IN THE STATE. THE STATE'S LEADERS MIGHT KEEP IN MIND WHO WIELDS THE BIGGER STICK AT THIS POINT. CALIFORNIA SET UP A MARKET IN WHICH SELLERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CHARGE VERY HIGH PRICES FOR ELECTRICITY SINCE SUPPLIES STARTED GETTING TIGHT A YEAR AGO. SELLERS SAY THEY HAVE PLAYED BY THE RULES THEY WERE GIVEN AND NOBODY HAS PROVED OTHERWISE WITH THE ONE EXCEPTION OF A FINE PAID BY WILLIAMS COMPANIES (WMB) FOR ONE PARTICULAR INSTANCE OF VIOLATING A CONTRACT.

ALMOST EVERY ATTEMPT BY THE BUY SIDE - THE UTILITIES THE ISO AND NOW THE (CONT) STATE TREASURY - TO LOWER PRICES HAS RESULTED IN HIGHER PRICES OR BLACKOUTS OR BOTH. THE WINDFALL-PROFITS TAX IDEA IS THE MOST RECENT EXAMPLE BUT THOSE WHO INSIST ON PRICE CAPS SHOULD KEEP THIS IN MIND: THE ISO HAS HAD PRICE CAPS SINCE IT BEGAN OPERATION MORE THAN THREE YEARS AGO. OBVIOUSLY PRICE CAPS HAVEN'T WORKED JUST AS THEY HAVE NEVER WORKED EXCEPT DURING WARTIME. IN FACT PRICE CAPS HAVE BEEN A QUESTIONABLE MEDICINE PRESCRIBED FOR THE WRONG DISEASE. AT BEST PRICE CAPS MIGHT RESTRICT PRICE SPIKES. CALIFORNIA'S PROBLEM IS PERPETUAL HIGH PRICES. IT CAN'T AFFORD THE GOING RATE AT NIGHTTIME LET ALONE THE HIGHER MARKET PRICES DURING THE AFTERNOONS IN A HEATWAVE. CALIFORNIA MUST FIGURE OUT HOW TO PLAY BETTER THE GAME IT INVENTED. THE INSANELY COMPLICATED COMPUTER-BASED PURCHASING OF POWER ENDED A FEW MONTHS AGO AFTER THE CALIFORNIA POWER EXCHANGE WAS CLOSED DOWN BY FEDERAL REGULATORS AND THE ISO LOST ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO BUY POWER. THE MATCH BETWEEN THE PROGRAMS AND THE ENERGY TRADERS WASN'T EXACTLY IBM'S BIG BLUE VERSUS GARRY KASPAROV. ALMOST EVERYONE IN THE MARKET AGREES THAT THE UTILITIES' HUMAN TRADERS COULD (CONT) HAVE BOUGHT NEEDED POWER FOR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS LESS THAN THE PROGRAMS THAT THE UTILITIES WERE REQUIRED TO USE BY STATE LAW. SINCE THE DEMISE OF PROGRAMMED PURCHASING THE COMPUTERS HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY HUMANS BUT WITHOUT MUCH BETTER RESULTS. THE TEAM ASSEMBLED TO BUY TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF SPOT POWER EVERY DAY CONSISTS MOSTLY OF FORMER EMPLOYEES OF THE POWER EXCHANGE AND ISO AS WELL AS EXPENSIVE CONSULTANTS WITH NO ENERGY TRADING EXPERIENCE. ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE TRADING TEAM FOR EXAMPLE IS A FORMER PUBLIC RELATIONS DIRECTOR FOR THE POWER EXCHANGE WITH NO TRADING EXPERIENCE PRIOR TO THE CURRENT JOB. AS ONE ISO EMPLOYEE WAS WONT TO SAY: IT'S LIKE WATCHING A FOOTBALL GAME BETWEEN NOTRE DAME AND ST. MARY'S SCHOOL FOR UNWED MOTHERS. AND THE SIGNING OF TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF FIVE- AND 10-YEAR CONTRACTS IS BEING EXECUTED MAINLY BY FORMER EXECUTIVES OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON - PEOPLE THAT LEFT THE UTILITY YEARS AGO TO BECOME CONSULTANTS AND ALSO DON'T HAVE TRADING EXPERIENCE. GOOD IDEAS MEANWHILE HAVE LANGUISHED. (CONT) WE ARE GOING TO INSTALL METERS IN EVERY MAJOR COMMERCIAL CONCERN IN THE STATE THIS SUMMER AND GO TO REAL-TIME PRICING DAVIS TOLD WALL STREET ANALYSTS ON FEB. 28. THAT PROPOSAL WAS GREETED BY MANY OBSERVERS AS THE MOST CONSTRUCTIVE IDEA FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO DATE. WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO REAL-TIME PRICING FOR CALIFORNIA'S BIG BUSINESSES SINCE THEN? NOTHING. THE PROBLEM IS THAT EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA IS 'SPECIAL' SAID STANFORD ECONOMIST AND CALIFORNIA ISO CONSULTANT FRANK WOLAK. EVERY INDUSTRY FROM OIL REFINERS TO INTERNET SERVER FARMS HAS HAD LOBBYISTS IN SACRAMENTO SUCCESSFULLY SECURING EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE. MY POINT HAS BEEN THAT IF WHAT THEY DO IS SO VALUABLE THEN THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE HIGHER PRICES. BUSINESSES WITH ABOUT 10000 MEGAWATTS OF LOAD HAVE REAL-TIME METERS. EVERY ONE OF THEM SHOULD BE GETTING MARKET PRICES SAID WOLAK. (CONT) ONE OF THE GREATEST ADVANTAGES THAT SELLERS OF ELECTRICITY TO CALIFORNIA HAVE HAD IS THAT CONSUMERS HAVE FIXED PRICES SO DEMAND IS INFLEXIBLE. SELLERS KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH ELECTRICITY THE UTILITIES MUST BUY BASED ON TEMPERATURES AND THE TIME OF DAY WOLAK SAYS AND THEY SIMPLY SUPPLY THE MARKET JUST ENOUGH POWER AT HIGH MARGINAL PRICES. REDUCING OVERALL CONSUMPTION THROUGH HIGHER RATES WILL HELP THE STATE SOME BUT MAKING 25% OF DEMAND FLEXIBLE BASED ON PRICE WOULD GIVE THE STATE A FIGHTING CHANCE IN THE MARKET ACCORDING TO WOLAK. BUT THAT APPARENTLY IS TOO COMPLICATED OR POLITICALLY DIFFICULT. PRICE CAPS A WINDFALL-PROFITS TAX AND POLITICAL PATRONAGE JOBS FOR BUYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF POWER MAY NOT SAVE THE STATE FROM BANKRUPTCY BUT THEY ARE EASIER TO SELL - OR SLIP THROUGH - IN SACRAMENTO. -BY MARK GOLDEN DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 201-938-4604 MARK.GOLDEN@DOWJONES.COM [/INST] Category: Company Business, Strategy, etc.(elaborate in Section 3 [Topics])"

The vote was 50 to 5 to report the bill. Other committees -- Ways and Means Science and Resources -- also moved their energy bills this week. Thus the House is on track to consider a merged package before the start of the August Recess on August 3rd. As to electricity during the several days of debate this week both Chairmen Tauzin and Barton reaffirmed their intention to next move to electricity issues. Mr. Barton's staff advised me this morning that the subcommittee he chairs will hold a hearing on Friday July 20th on all electricity issues other than transmission. While Mr. Barton has publicly held out hope of marking up an electricity bill this month sources on and off the committee do not see this timetable as realistic. On the Senate side the majority staff is working on an electricity white paper that may be circulated for comment next week. Below is a recap of action on amendments of interest to Enron: 1. Last night on a largely partisan vote (with Democrats Hall Green and John voting with the Republicans) the Committee rejected an amendment by Rep. Jane Harman (D-CA) (that was to have been offered by Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA)) that would have retroactively amended the FERC refund date and essentially ordered refunds regardless of amounts owed to power sellers. 2. First thing this morning the Committee again on a largely partisan basis (with Democrats Hall Green John and Towns) rejected a Waxman amendment to impose cost-of-service rates on all power in the West (other than generation added after 1/1/01). (Originally Mr. Waxman was going to offer amendment to impose cost-of-service rates only on those who do not supply all available power during an emergency but he ended up offering basically what he had pursued in subcommittee on the old Californa Only bill.) 3. The Committee adopted an amendment by Rep. Shadegg to amend the Natural Gas Act to make it clear that a natural gas transportation facility shall not be added to the National Register of Historic Places until FERC has abandoned the facility. Apparently there have been some instances of old pipelines being considered as historic places under federal law. The House Resources Committee added a similar amendment to its package yesterday. 4. By voice vote the Committee rejected a Waxman Amendment to require the president to propose and implement a plan to bring U.S. greenhouse gases down to 1990 levels. There was strong opposition voiced by many Republicans and Democrats to this amendment. 5. By mixed vote of 24 to 29 the Committee defeated a Waxman Amendment to set cost and performance goals for renewables including wind power and authorize federal funds to assist with commercial project costs (up to 50 percent).

The intranet site will be placed on the home.enron.com webpage by Tuesday morning for all Enron employees to access. However today this comprehensive database is available to you for your California Power Issue needs. The database has been populated with the latest information that I have received concerning this topic and has been broken down in three categories: California Power Issues National Power Issues and Secured Documents. It has then been broken down further into subcategories. The secured documents sections will only be accessible to those that are receiving this e-mail. Please let me know if you believe others should have access to this information. The secured document section contains all the information that I have received that Luntz Consulting has helped us develop i.e. principals statements speeches and facts as well as talking points and other statements developed internally. These documents can be easily switched to open access to all Enron employees if you believe that these documents should not be restricted. To access the intranet site you must be logged on to the network and then go to this link: (It is best if you copy this link and paste it in your internet Explorer or Netscape browser.) Once you are at this site you will be able to access all articles and information that I have collected/received concerning the California Power Issue. You can navigate the site by using the links on the left hand side of the screen. While navigating this site keep in mind that the actual interface will be changed before we go live on Tuesday morning. To access the secured documents click on secured documents and type in your user name which is the same as if you are logging onto the network and then type in your password which is the same as if you are logging onto the network. However if you have difficulties entering this site you will need to change your Lotus internet password. Which is very simple to do and which you will need to do regardless if you decide to use this site or not it is all part of the current computer migration. To change your internet password go to this link and then hit the edit person key. Go to the last field that says internet password and type in whatever password you would like preferably your current network login password. (In the internet password section you will see a bunch of numbers and letters delete those and enter your new network password.) There are still some bugs that will be worked out by Tuesday but I thought since this is such a fast moving issue it was best to get this tool out so it could be used when needed.

Narrow because for every significant activity there are only a few who are in the loop and impermanent because very little information is committed to writing (most of it is exchanged in person or over the phone). This is I believe what lies at the heart of complaints about cross-department communication. We now have some solutions emerging -- software that enables more people to record and post information in HTML format on company intranet sites.

H.R. 2814 (Reps. Tom Sawyer (D-OH) and Richard Burr (R-NC)) On Aug. 2nd (the last day Congress was in session before the August Recess) the above named members of the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee introduced H.R. 2814 the Interstate Transmission Act. The legislation is bad because among other things it requires FERC to establish transmission pricing policies that provide incentives for voluntary participation and formation of RTOs with language prohibiting policies that have the effect of forcing transmitting utilities to join RTOs. Also objectionable is that the bill would limit pancaking but at the same time require FERC to establish a reasonable transition mechanism or period for additive charges. The legislation prohibits FERC from conditioning any order upon a transmitting utility being required to transfer operational control of jurisdictional facilities to an ISO or RTO. The bill would require that participating transmitting utilities must approve the form structure and operating entity of any RTO. In addition to the RTO language the bill has the old version of the NERC reliability legislation in it. The bill also has a PUHCA exemption for RTOs repeals Federal Power Act sec. 203 on the disposition of property and includes the tax changes that IOUs seek for transfers of property to an independent transmission company. Barbara Hueter advises that First Energy has its hq in Rep. Sawyer's district. Rep. Burr is from North Carolina so perhaps Duke had its utility hat on in working with him. I am checking into where Duke is on this issue. Rep. Burr is the Vice Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and close to Chairman Tauzin -- so his support for this legislation is significant (see Andy Black comment below). 2. Andy Black Meeting Andy is meeting with various trade associations this month to discuss electricity legislation. He is only meeting with a few companies on a one-on-one basis -- Enron Reliant Dynegy and TXU. His timing is to have a legislative draft for Chairman Barton to review when Congress returns after Labor Day. If Chairman Barton approves or makes changes the draft will be circulated to members of the subcommittee and the public for further comment. The intent is to mark up an electricity bill this Fall so that if the Senate acts on electricity in its comprehensive energy bill the issue will be ripe for consideration in a House-Senate conference committee. Here is a run down of my comments and Andy's comments on specific issues. a. RTOs Chairman Barton supports RTOs. At a minimum the draft will affirm FERC's authority as the commissioners have requested. Andy is considering going beyond that to mandate RTO participation. Not sure he can hold that position in the subcommittee. He is looking to Enron and others to help them explain and build support for RTOs. Informed him of our initial informal coalition steps. However Andy asked me to look at sec. 3 of the Sawyer-Burr referenced above which I realized after the meeting is the part that deals with incentive rates and negotiated rates to expand transmission and voluntary RTOs. I have a call in to Andy to reconcile these statements since the Sawyer-Burr bill is based on voluntary RTOs. Hopefully he is thinking of using the incentive and negotiated rate language and NOT the objectionable voluntary RTO aspects. I will strongly encourage him to do the right thing in that regard. b. PUHCA The draft will use the Pickering bill (H.R. 1101). Told Andy about our concerns with the record keeping provisions of that bill. Will send him our legislative language to clarify these provisions so that they do not open up all of Enron's records -- even those unrelated to transactions with a regulated utility affiliate. c. PURPA Prospective repeal. On back up power they are thinking of requiring that rates for back up power be just and reasonable until there is retail competition in the state. d. Interconnection They have received a proposal from Trigen that Andy says we will like. I am contacting EPSA to get the details. e. Net Metering They are likely to include the Inslee bill to require net metering. I explained our concern that the bill's mandate applies to all retail energy suppliers -- including EES -- even though this should only apply to utilities with an obligation to serve that it does not make sense to mandate it on service providers like EES (per Jim's helpful comments yesterday). I need to get more information to Andy. f. Transmission Jurisdiction Thankfully Andy is NOT going to use those portions of the bill as reported by subcommittee in the last Congress that gave use heart burn on jurisdiction. Specifically the draft will not say FERC does not have jurisdiction over the transportation component of a bundled retail sale -- the draft will not get into the bundled/unbundled issue at all. The draft will bring munis co-ops and PMAs under the FERC umbrella for transmission jurisdiction purposes. g. Siting On siting Andy is thinking of some type of mechanism that would give a State one year before federal eminent domain attaches. h. Reliability On a negative note Andy intends to use the latest NERC reliability language because NERC's version has strong support among the Members of the subcommittee and no other alternative has emerged with political support (i.e. not PJM). I explained our concerns. He said our best bet is for DoE or FERC to come forward to seek something other than the NERC version. He said Members eyes glaze over on reliability with everything else on the plate. i. Negawatts I raised the absence of negawatts on his issue list. He said he is open to considering it again but that there was left over political baggage and unresolved issues from when this was attempted during consideration of the California bill earlier this summer. Your questions and comments on the any of the above are most welcome. [/INST] Category: Company Business, Strategy, etc.(elaborate in Section 3 [Topics])"

The other congressional participants were staff to Reps. Steve Largent and Chip Pickering. After meeting all week (except Wednesday) the group was unable to reach an agreement or even a provisional consensus on what could be placed in an electricity title that could be added to the comprehensive energy package that the House Energy and Commerce Committee will begin to process next week. Congressional staff will report to their bosses on the status of the discussions as of this afternoon and from there the Members will determine whether to proceed further. There is a general perception that committee leaders will elect NOT to take up electricty legislation at this time and in the context of the broader package in the absence of broadly supported legislation. In the end the discussions did not bear fruit because divisions remained over the usual issues and along most of the usual fault lines. As the drafts progressed during the week we succeeded in deleting the original language that would have had Congress weigh into the bundled/unbundled and federa/state jurisdictional rules at the very time that likely adverse action in Congress could in turn adversely impact the Supreme Court case. A last minute attempt was made by the congressional staff to stitch together a minimalist electricity title that would have included reliability (with the understanding that the NERC discussions could produce modifications more to our liking) PUHCA repeal PURPA reform interconnection language and federal siting. However in each instance there were one more politically relevant interest groups not willing to go along. Cong. DeLay's staff also tried to link PUHCA repeal to those who had joined an RTO. There was also an attempt to strip it down to reliability interconnection and siting (eminent domain) -- but again there was either disagreement on the details or objection from those who favorite subject was left out of the minimalist package. There was one rather interesting discussion when the public power folks floated language on market power that included a sentence that would have made the filed rate doctrine inapplicable to antitrust challenges to market rates. Needless to say I strongly objected as did EPSA and others. As noted the lack of an agreement reduces our exposure when the mark up occurs. In the absence of an electricity title refund price control and other issues should not be germane to the package that the subcommittee will take up on Tuesday and the full committee next Friday. That package will have five issues addressed: conservation clean coal hyrdo nuclear and reformulated gasoline. Details to follow once legislative language is released.

Ideally the plant would inject / vaporize normal butane at the rate of 18750 gallons per hour into a high pressure natural gas transmission system. Current gas pipeline specs are as follows: Operating pressure - 850 - 1000 psig worst case 750 normal range 800-900 Gas Volume - 650000 - 750000 MMBtu/day Expected normal butane (GPA spec) requirement - 450000 gallons/day (18750 gal/ per hour) My questions are: 1) Is anyone currently using butanes for peaking service and if so where? 2) Do we need to blend with air (how much) or can we inject straight normal butane? 3) At what line pressure point do the butanes re-liquefy further downstream of the injection point as the pipeline pressure falls? 4) Is this peaking plant configuration feasible and if so at what price (ball park here don't go way out of your way)? (If it's not what would your suggestion be for a design). I will fax you the normal butane specs as soon as I get them (please email back your fax number). As always we're on a pretty tight time frame. After you've had a chance to review the above I'd like to get together and discuss this with you. I can meet you in Ohio if it fits your schedule better just let me know. Thanks for the help and I look forward to talking with you soon.

The course is cross-listed between the Haas School of Business and the Energy & Resources Group at UC Berkeley. The syllabus for the course is attached. We have 43 graduate students in the course most pursuing a masters degree in business or energy & resources though there are also a few PhD students. These are very smart students -- many of whom already have experience in the energy industries -- and we believe the course puts them in a position to immediately contribute to any energy-related organization that they would join. Many of these students are interested in either summer or permanent employment starting as early as May. If Enron has openings that you would like to advertise to these students please send me the job description (or the URL for it)and I can forward it to the class list. Jim and I think this is a very strong class and many of the students are interested in making a career in either the business or the public policy side of the energy industry. We're hoping to provide the connections to help make sure they find the best job matches possible. Sincerely Severin Severin Borenstein E.T.

My understanding is that the key story line is that COMPETITION IS WORKING AND SHOULD BE PUSHED FORWARD. We need to be able to give examples of what is happening - deregulation customers are winning. For example our CSU customers are just fine even with higher energy markets. I think that are some key questions that we need to consider when we put these together: Who is the audience? My answer - California policymakers key stakeholders FERC federal government. Can we use this in the FERC Investigation on Markets? My answer - we have to California is too big and important not realize that California will play a role in FERC's discussions. What is the timing of message? My answer - Wherever and whenever needs to be coordinated. This CA legislative process (next 2.5 weeks) may be a possibility. FERC Investigation. Taking the story nationally is good if we have the facts from CA. Who will deliver the message? My answer - Everyone on the Enron team needs to have the same message all of the time. We can't let any opportunity pass us by. Do we demonize the utilities? My answer - if necessary we just need to make sure that we have as many facts to prove our points if we do attack. How do we prove that rolling back to regulation is ridiculous? My answer - retain LEGC to develop the hypothetical of what would have happened? NEEDS TO BE DISCUSSED INTERNALLY - LEGC MAY NOT BE THAT FRIENDLY.

Let's talk more about how to approach the issue after we meet with Ron tomorrow about MAOP. 12/31/92 Interconnect Agreement: Sec. 1.3 specifies pressures and states that unless there is an agreement to provide firm compression service TW will accept up to 200000 on an interruptible basis. Sec. 2 states that the Blanco Hub MAOP shall not be exceeded. Sec. 4.2 limits damages (no consequential damages). The contract also has a fairly standard force majeure clause. 2/18/93 letter amendment: Sec. 3 obligates TW to provide firm compression service in order to accept 200000 into TW's system (provided MOGI has pressure of at least 650 and quantity of at least 140). Acknowledges that this is an agreement to provide firm compression in accordance with Sec. 1.3 of 12/92 agreement. 9/25/95 letter amendment: Increases quantity to be received at the interconnect to 250000 once the San Juan expansion is effective. My initial conclusions: It is pretty clear we have an obligation to accept 250000 on a firm basis provided that Burlington complies with the pressure requirements. Probably the only way we can avoid this obligation is if accepting 250000 would cause us to exceed the hub MAOP. In that case we can argue impossibility of performance. Also we could avoid the obligation because the summer heat above certain temperatures constitutes force majeure. This argument is strengthened by the fact that temperatures seem to have gotten hotter over the years. The fact that we entered into our most recent agreement with Burlington in January of this year weakens the credibility of our arguments (they will say we should have known by now). Burlington might try to argue that we have an absolute obligation to comply with the agreement even if it means expensive system modifications. That argument is not a very strong one because the agreement contains no such affirmative obligation and in fact quite clearly describes the facilities that are the subject of the agreement.

Chairman Barton's fundamental view is that Congress not FERC should determine how RTOs come about. And that the market and the industry should determine how RTOs are shaped etc. not FERC. He bristled at one point and said he had more faith in us than he had in FERC or we had in ourselves to determine how RTOs come about going so far as to saying that under his draft they would be our RTOs -- meaning those of us present. I pointed out this is wrong because under his draft the transmission owners particularly those least likely to join up would have all the leverage. I said that the basic flaw in the draft is that it assumes there are only two parties to the transaction -- FERC and transmission owners -- forgetting the rest of us including consumers. He said we could become transmission owners if we wanted to!!! On the 40000 MW size minimum he said many experts had advised them this is the correct number. We said that putting a number in to the statute ran counter to his oft-stated desire for a fair process to produce RTOs driven by market forces not regulators. The two elements of good news -- Barton reconfirmed that a markup this year is very unlikely AND he expressed that he would not spend too much time on electricity next year if it started to crowd out other issues like Clean Air Act Amendments and nuclear waste legislation. This suggests a strategy possibility in terms of running out the clock. He said he has the votes by a wide margin to report the RTO draft but will entertain some changes. He said the only reason he has not marked up the bill is that the Sept. 11th terrorist attacks have taken attention away from the issue and subcommittee members are not engaged on the issue. He said those of us who support could roll the dice with them but that there are things that only Congress can do -- like getting all transmission owners into RTOs -- and that these statutory changes are so important that we should not oppose the draft.

Everyone on the team loves this idea because the messages in the book represent Enron thinking and culture. In case you aren't familiar with the book Beth Tilney has a copy. Our plan is to give every employee a book which will have a note of appreciation on the inside cover from Ken Jeff and Joe. We are contacting Random House (who will contact the Seuss estate) to see if we can purchase 20000 copies and to get permission to use some of the copy in our internal communication materials. The per unit cost is considerably lower due to the volume. We think employees will like this idea. What do you think?

Additionally he second guessed every position I put on sold me out of positions (which turned out good) and used all our allocated VAR for his own benefit. Tom has a reputation for not representing employees well in the end of year review process. I found this to be the case as well. Tom is difficult to communicate with Additionally we had an incident w/ an employee when Tom offered her an employment agreement. She felt that she was being forced to sign the agreement When she declined the agreement and turned in resignation she said that Tom said he would make it difficult for her to leave She said that she felt threatened by Tom Her boy friend called Tom and threatened him As a result Legal asked Tom not to have further contact with the employee.

I think the two main issues you raise are the right ones but I have one other thought we should discuss internally. Do we want to create a set of incentives for the management of PJM that would entitle management to incentive compensation to the extent they meet certain goals -- eg relieving congestion on the grid increasing throughput across the transmission system expediting interconnection (measured in terms of actual interconnections not just applications approved) etc. This way we could create an organization that would have the incentive to make a workable and open transmission system.

It was the same quasi-legislative format as the previous hearing. Speakers were invited by the Commission and only the ALJ and the Commissioners could cross-examine the witnesses. Commissioners Lynch and Wood presided. Michael Kahn chairman of the Electricity Oversight Board was there and participated in some cross-examination as well. Speakers were: ISO: Kellan Fluckiger COO Anjali Sheffrin Director of Market Analysis Frank Wolak Chairman of Market Surveillance Committee Cal PX: David Jermain former VP Compliance Audits & Reg. Affairs Seth Wilson South Coast Air Quality Management District: Carol Coy Deputy Executive Director CPUC: Harvey Morris Principal Attorney SDG&E: Donald Garber ISO's main message was that many factors contribute to the high prices in the wholesale market: 1. Demand growth over past two years at or around 5% (98-99 99-00) 2. Lack of generation additions in entire west 3. Reduced imports of electricity from NW due to low hydro and policy to retain water in spring. 4. Natural Gas price increases over 1999 at almost 2x's 1999 levels in August 5. Nox emissions trading at or around $40/pound 6. Increased underscheduling from June-August ISO has concluded that the reduction in the price caps (from $500 to $250) have increased the overall cost of electricity with the highest total cost/MWh ($180) experienced in August relative to $167/MWh in June and $118 in July. Reason given is that the caps have reduced markup (could be interpreted as generator profit) in peak hours but supply costs have been driven up in lower load hours. While ISO staff said they will seek an extension of its authority from FERC to be set price caps also raised concerns about the affect any further reductions would have on the market. They conclude that such a reduction would deter new investment preclude generators from recovering fixed costs of production and increase dependence on OOM purchases (as a result of lower imports). ISO staff will make a proposal to the ISO Board October 6 to do the following: 1. File for extension of price cap authority to FERC. 2. Request FERC to institute mandatory forward contract requirement on generators for a significant portion of their capacity. 3. CPUC should allow full peak requirements to be forward contracted and hedged by UDCs 4. CPUC and state should promote price responsive demand programs 5. Maintain sufficient planning reserves. ISO Staff also stated that: 1. Need to create disincentive for underscheduling for load and generation a. Charge OOM cost to underscheduled load b. Charge replacement reserve cost to underscheduled generation c. Additional charge for real-time market transactions 2. Attract and expedite new resources MARKET POWER: While the Commissioners spent the majority of the day picking apart the underlying reasons for the rise in prices the conclusion of the hearing was President Lynch asking the ISO and PX to name names on who has been exerting market power. Both the PX and the ISO said that it would be impossible to determine from the information they have. Secondly the analysis they have done show that no single market participant is consistently exhibiting the ability (opportunity) to exercise market power. Therefore at one point or another nearly every market participant has market power. Wolak suggested that in order to reduce the amount of market power in peak periods require forward contracting OR increase profit incentives in off-peak period where generators many times sell below short-run marginal costs. No further quasi-legislative hearings are planned. [/INST] Category: Company Business, Strategy, etc.(elaborate in Section 3 [Topics])"

The timing of next week's meeting to resolve the legislation reflects the legislative realities that the committees of jurisdiction in Congress will take up the realibility legislation along with other electricity issues as early as the second week of September. In fact congressional staff in the Senate and House are drafting legislative language on electricity issues during the August recess. They have pressed the coalition for a final work product. I gathered that at least some of what Jeff'spresentation to the NERC board would be about concerns matters beyond the legislation as such but since they go to the NERC board's operation and independence may go to our comfort level with NERC as the standards setting organization. Given the issues and concerns that have been addressed and communicated to NERC and our preference for the PJM model (as Jeff told John Q. Anderson in the conference call) I think NERC got the information it wanted to get out of the call even though it didn't like the answers: i.e. whether Sarah and I have been faithfully representing Enron's position whether Enron supports an SRO type organization and whether there is anything they can do to get us on board. Perhaps we should have another conference call early next week so that Sarah and I have our guidance from everyone going into the August 9th meeting. For one thing we need to determine if we are in any position to provide detailed comments on the shortened NERC version at the August 9th meeting or whether we do not wish to engage them on what specific changes it would take to get us on board. My sense is that since we have to deal with the players in the room on other issues our overall position will be strengthened if we have some specific comments to make to explain our decision not to support NERC's version even the shortened one. Don't get me wrong -- we have plenty of good reasons not to I just wasn't sure how engaged we wanted to be in identifying changes that would bring us on board since I gather our opposition is more fundamental (no Western deference budget concerns independence issues etc.).

David Cook was on the call as well and we do not understand the sudden urgency for NERC to reach closure. Has NERC given up on Enron? As we understand it John Q Anderson agreed to give Jeff an opportunity to present present before the NERC Board some ke y issues for Enron before trying to finalize any NERC legislation proposal. Does this meeting next week preclude that presentation from occurring? Or will there be willingness to alter the language significantly enough to appease the Enron concerns next week?

This will involve quoting prices for buying and selling bankruptcy protection in respect of reference entities many of whom are our counterparties in a variety of different commercial and financial contexts. This exciting cocktail of credit derivatives and Enron Online raises significant novel legal risks for Enron. Probably the most significant risk would arise in a situation where Enron has confidential information about a reference entity and wrongfully uses that information in pricing the credit derivative on that entity. This could well result in legal proceeding against Enron. In practice an allegation of misuse of confidential information can be very difficult indeed to defend without adequate procedures in place to safeguard that information. In fact Enron's credit trading will rely strictly on publicly available financial information and will not involve the use of confidential information unless the reference entity has specifically consented. Nevertheless to avoid the appearance of impropriety we are taking additional steps to consider confidentiality agreements we have in place with potential reference entities before deciding whether or not we will quote prices on such entities. Against this background is the ever-present risk of insider dealing. This crime - which carries a maximum prison sentence of 7 years and an unlimited fine - is committed where a person (or member of their family etc) deals in the securities (shares bonds or derivatives on them) of a listed company on the basis of unpublished (confidential) price-sensitive information. We do not expect at this time to deal in publicly traded bonds as part of EnronCredit.com but insider dealing is relevant to the conduct of Enron staff and could affect other parts of our business. In addition SFA rules require the safeguarding of confidential information the misuse of which is a serious disciplinary matter. In order to ensure the success of this new business and that confidential information is not misused either by Enron or its staff we are now introducing new policies and procedures (attached) which include a simple Restricted List procedure. In essence they require you - to take prudent steps to safeguard confidential information within Enron to notify Michael Brown Mark Elliott or myself if you become aware of confidential or sensitive information (or circumstances) about a counterparty which you think might make it appropriate for that counterparty to be placed on the Restricted List. To make life easier numerous examples of the types of information which might be relevant are set out in the attached procedures. Please familiarise yourself and anyone else in your group you think appropriate with these procedures. As you will see you are not expected to make difficult determinations about whether an entity should or should not be added to the Restricted List just to let us know if you think there is a possibility that it should be added. We will also provide quick briefing sessions to ensure that each of you is comfortable with these new procedures. Many thanks for your co-operation.

Spears the other Republican appointee is not at all free market in my view. I would not like this to mentioned anywhere else but I have found that the farm reps on the Commission may sound deregulatory but are not and have been really troublesome without a good free market person on board. And there are no truly free market persons on board at the Commission (every single other agricultural rep that I worked with on the Commission were trouble even though they claimed to be deregulatory -- and they were far worse before I got there and after I left.) I visited with Newsome a day before Inauguration and I was appalled at what they were planning to do concerning agency structure -- that would have elevated the regulatory lawyers and diminished the role of the economists at the agency. Misguided and showed to me a lack of understanding of how organizational structures can affect what comes out of an agency. I am often at odds with the industry view regarding CFTC issues. I don't think the futures exchanges who have a lot of power necessarily are pro-competition and many of the non-exchange folks who lobby on CFTC issues are Washington or New York (Democrat - which is why they want to involve Ken at this level) lawyers who do not understand markets and who are more interested in being able to claim influence or impact. The CFTC is in awful shape -- the quality of staff is horrendous and the Commission is relying on some of the worst people for their policy work (same folks that Brooksley Born used same folks who have advocated more regulation of the OTC market for years). Many quality folks do not want the job as Chairman because it's been such a backwater. I am looking for some good folks. Have at least one person who would be good at that job. And it's not Newsome. Please do not share this information with the usual folks as they hate me anyway (I'm too free market and have argued against their fixes). Sorry for this scathing review but this is an important appointment. Wendy [/INST] Category: Company Business, Strategy, etc.(elaborate in Section 3 [Topics])"

Why not wait until they are fully released particularly if one of them is going to sue under workers comp scheme? Also Hoyt you need to be careful about revealing conversations with GSP counsel to MG -- I noticed you had cc'd someone from Media General in the prior email. We don't want to waive any privileges.

We would like to bring them back to do light-duty work to get them in the swing of working again and also to get some adminstrative work done. I am concerned that bringing these employees back to work on light duty will cause these cases to become an Enron liability rather than an MG liability. I discussed this with Pat McCarthy the labor and employment law attorney we are using in NJ and he said that the liability would typically not transfer to GSP just because we brought them back . . . it would still be an MG liability UNLESS THE EMPLOYEE HURT HIMSELF AGAIN. In which case GSP owns it. However Pat said that a lot of what determines the ownership of the worker's comp cases is written into the purchase and sale agreement. He said that there may be language that addresses an employee's return to work from worker's comp. I know that we have an ongoing dispute about worker's comp with MG at this point. What would be your recommendation on bringing these employees back to work? As a bit of additional info one of the two employees seems eager to come back . . . the other one does not. An employee told me that the second employee actually has a lawsuit filed against MG/old GSP about his injury. [/INST] Category: Company Business, Strategy, etc.(elaborate in Section 3 [Topics])"

I am less certain about the direction FERC will go on pricing since even the staff has recognized stumbling blocks in their own recommendation and offers possible variants. The ISO has not submitted revised tariff sheets for approval yet so it is unlikely they would try to implement their own plan in the near term. If they try to do so without FERC approval possible legal avenues might include the filing of a complaint at FERC asking for fast track processing (this fast is measured in weeks not days) and/or seeking injunctive relief in court (faster) which can be hard to obtain but not impossible depending entirely on the circumstances. Will keep you posted if I learn anything new on this.

The two most aggregious parts are the cost based standing bids and the ban on exports. I know that we are commenting on this proposal. I am also looking for intellegence on whether the ISO proposal has any chance of getting approved by FERC. If it is not approved by FERC what can the Californians do? California has ignored FERC before. If they attempt to unilaterally implement changes what is the likelihood that the Feds step in to intervene? If you hear anything on this matter please keep me posted. The proposed plan will have a huge impact on the California market and we need as much advance notice as possible.

Similar letters were delivered by Greenpeace Europe in native languages to Enron's offices in the UK Netherlands Spain and Belgium. I have attached a copy of one of the letters below. All the questions are the same in each. I have drafted a response with the goals of: 1) Being responsive to Greenpeace without being defensive or without greenwashing. We have an already-published public statement on climate change and a very positive solution-oriented story to tell with many facts and accomplishments to back up our statements. I think our letter can land in the stack that they consider positive responses and not in the stack of non-responses or we don't care responses. 2) Steering away from directly answering the no-win questions about Kyoto. I think we can respond to the letter in a way that provides meaningful answers to the general themes of the letter. I have discussed this with many of you already but I strongly feel that we should not get dragged down into debates over what we like/dislike support/oppose about Kyoto....we'll quickly get into questions we can't now answer and may never be able to answer. I'd prefer it if we rise above the politics of the issue and look solution-oriented by saying counties and companies should continue to be engaged in this important issue. 3) Developing corporate-wide messages that we can use in multiple applications -- arming our PR and govt. affairs advocates with a tight script to use in their efforts responding to shareholder inquiries and annual meeting Q&A Ken Lay or other executive speeches and presentations something for our Corporate Responsibility annual report. Sorry for the long preamble but climate change has become a very sensitive issue of late and our message/strategy needs to be very coordinated and we need to have one clear set of statements that everyone in the company can understand and use. With that said I also believe that these messages should be used very carefully as the subject matter is complex and straying too far from the basics can be dangerous. We should designate one or two clear spokespeople that can answer any follow up to the Greenpeace letter by press or policymakers and really stick to the boundaries of what's in our response letter. There is also the issue of customizing responses from the European offices using this letter as a template and adding a few examples of Enron good deeds in the local areas. I am not opposed to doing so but would again appreciate being able to review these responses before they go. Please let me know if you have other views. I would like to send our response by early next week maybe even Monday 4/23 if we can turn it around that fast. Thank you for your input and assistance and I look forward to your reply.

Recall that we tried to negotiate a settlement with insurers for some time and then UI served DPC with a notice of arbitration because of the threat of a bad faith claim. I think I summarized it earlier for you but essentially we now have the choice of pursuing litigation in London against insurers since United India has now sued us in London Court (in addition to arbitration because they figured out a little late that under the policy only quantum may be arbitrated and they don't want to admit liability). Our option before was only to sue them in India which really isn't an option which is why we agreed to arbitration. Basically UI can't decide what it wants to do but this memo from Linklaters sets forth DPC's options which Justin Ken Blades and I discussed regarding the pros and cons of litigation v arbitration. It's a complex mess and I'll be glad to sit down and explain it to you (or not) but we are basically writing to UI's counsel to try and determine what their position is and then we'll decide whether to litigate or arbitrate. Part of this relates to the adjuster's agreement with Ken as to the quantum owed upon a determination of liability. This is all very strange but nothing regarding India or DPC surprises me anymore. We'll talk about it when you have time but I just want you to know I'm taking care of this--let me know how involved you want to be (or not...).

It carried the LA Times version of the Lockyer comments a couple days ago. Today it has the NY Times article on Ken Lay. It's pretty clear that in the near-term Enron and it's leadership are at risk of being engulfed in a political firestorm which bounces from coast to coast gaining strength each step of the way. However it is the long-term challenge that draws my attention. From my research to date I am left with the strong impression that the Enron's capacity for acquiring distilling and assessing business information is much stronger than it's abilities with public policy information. Ken Lay you and your team have shaped a innovative and entrepreneurial company rooted in agile arbitrage of business knowledge. Like Goldman Sachs it is hard for the man on the street to understand precisely what Enron does. However because of your presence in businesses that play out daily in homes schools and small businesses Enron will be scrutinized in a way the Goldman couldn't imagine in it's worst nightmares. From my perspective the success of Enron's business model demands a sure footing in both business and public policy. Going forward these two areas of expertise need become intertwined to assure the success of the highly sophisticated ethical innovative and insightful global corporation known as Enron. I would like to help you succeed with this challenge. I look forward to our discussions. Kevin 213-926-2626 Advertisers make this site possible. There were 30693 page views last week.

Now they must decide whether those companies have done anything illegal. State Attorney General Bill Lockyer said Thursday he believes the evidence ``strongly suggests'' power companies acted illegally to drive up prices. He has said that he would love to put top energy executives in jail. Brandon Bailey and Chris O'Brien in the San Jose Mercury -- 5/25/01 Davis blackout warnings -- a significant policy change aimed at minimizing business and consumer disruptions Gov. Gray Davis ordered state officials Thursday to enact a three-tier blackout warning system. Forecasts of blackouts will be issued 48 hours beforehand Davis said. General areas will be identified in warnings issued 24 hours before likely outages. Precise locations will be announced an hour before the power is cut he said. Dan Morain and Nancy Vogel in the Los Angeles Times Greg Lucas and Lynda Gledhill in the San Francisco Chronicle Noam Levey and Dion Nissenbaum in the San Jose Mercury John Hill in the Sacramento Bee Ed Mendel in the San Diego Union Robert Garrett in the Riverside Press Michael Coit in the Santa Rosa Press -- 5/25/01 Davis' popularity plunges in poll -- With California's energy crisis mounting Democratic Gov. Gray Davis has suffered a precipitous fall in his job approval rating and image among state residents according to a Field Poll released yesterday. For the first time since his November 1998 election more Californians have an unfavorable view of Davis' performance than favorable. Carla Marinucci in the San Francisco Chronicle Hallye Jordan in the San Jose Mercury John Marelius in the San Diego Union -- 5/25/01 Poll puts Riordan Davis in tight race -- Californians' assessment of Gov. Gray Davis has plummeted drastically as he has struggled to handle the state energy crisis placing outgoing Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan in a virtual dead heat with him for the 2002 governor's race according to a Field Poll released Thursday. Though Riordan has given no clear indication that he intends to run for governor 42 percent of registered voters said they would support the Republican mayor should he challenge Davis the Democratic incumbent. Forty-three percent said they would vote for Davis. Emily Bazar in the Sacramento Bee -- 5/25/01 California to gain from GOP's loss -- A single party switch in the Senate on Thursday handed California's Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer new clout with key leadership roles likely on issues ranging from military base closings to environmental cleanups. Vermont Sen. James Jeffords' announcement that he was quitting the Republican Party to be an independent affiliated with Democrats set up a takeover in which the Democrats with a de facto 51-49 majority will assume all Senate leadership posts and committee chairs. Bill Hillburg in the Los Angeles Daily News -- 5/25/01 PUC and 'baseline' rates -- Nine days after structuring the largest electricity rate increase in California history state regulators on Thursday launched a reexamination of the unpopular baselines used to determine how much each residential customer will pay. If the indicators are revised upward as most expect that would grant some customers relief from the rate hike but could necessitate future ones to generate enough revenue for power purchases. Tim Reiterman in the Los Angeles Times Michael Bazeley in the San Jose Mercury Carrie Peyton in the Sacramento Bee -- 5/25/01 Enron Bush -- Curtis H?bert Jr. Washington's top electricity regulator said he had barely settled into his new job this year when he had an unsettling telephone conversation with Kenneth L. Lay the head of the nation's largest electricity trader the Enron Corporation. Mr. H?bert chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said that Mr. Lay a close friend of President Bush's offered him a deal: If he changed his views on electricity deregulation Enron would continue to support him in his new job. Lowell Bergman and Jeff Gerth in the New York Times -- 5/25/01 Lockyer comes out swinging at oilman Davis has plenty of company in depths of poll -- The reaction from Gov. Gray Davis' camp to yesterday's poll showing him in the dumper was quick and blunt. Tell me something I don't already know adviser Paul Maslin said after being hit with the news that the latest Field Poll showed Davis' job rating down 18 points since January. None of this is news to us Maslin said. Matier & Ross in the San Francisco Chronicle -- 5/25/01 Water and power -- The California Public Utilities Commission authorized an increase in American States Water Co.'s rates at the Bear Valley Electric customer service area of its Southern California Water Co. unit to recover $2.4 million in deferred electric power costs. The amount will be recovered from customers over a five-year period. Sam Favate Dow Jones Newswires -- 5/25/01 Muni power -- Gov. Davis said he received a pledge Thursday from municipal utility officials that their agencies will sell excess power to the state at prices much lower than in the past. Despite simmering resentment at subjecting their customers to rolling blackouts the muni officials promised Davis they will keep cooperating with the state. Municipal utility customers including those in the Modesto Turlock and Merced irrigation districts will continue to face power blackouts officials said afterward. Jim Miller in the Modesto Bee -- 5/25/01 Edison merit raises -- Southern California Edison which is struggling to stay out of bankruptcy will hand out $19 million in merit raises to its 12000 employees today but top executives will forgo the raises because of the company's financial woes. Edison has doled out hefty merit raises in the past. But this year the company will pay the minimum under its variable compensation program which rewards employees for meeting certain company goals. Kate Berry in the Orange County Register -- 5/25/01 Cities with own utilities ask FERC to bar blackouts -- More than 15 California cities that have municipal utilities including Anaheim are asking federal regulators to exempt them from electricity blackouts ordered by the state's Independent System Operator. The city of Vernon was first to ask the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to rule that the ISO cannot force it to participate in California's rolling blackouts to serve demand in other areas. Vernon's utility argued that it was ridiculous to subject its customers to blackouts when it had enough power to keep the lights on. Amy Strahan Butler in the Orange County Register -- 5/25/01 Utility tax windfall -- As electricity rates rise consumers will get hit with a double whammy because of an obscure utility bill tax that many California cities have quietly been collecting for years. A member of the state Board of Equalization charges that some cities will reap windfalls from the utility user tax and he is backing a grass-roots movement to slash or repeal it. Few local governments are hurrying to forfeit the money saying that they need it to pay their own higher energy bills. Wendy Thermos in the Los Angeles Times -- 5/25/01 An air of discontent over diesel backups -- Gov. Gray Davis said yesterday that he may ask companies to run their emergency generators during Stage 3 electricity alerts as a way to stave off blackouts. And when blackouts do occur thousands of tractor-trailer-size generators will whir to life powering elevators and lights hospital equipment even assembly lines. But that prospect has created major concerns. Most of those industrial- strength generators run on diesel oil a highly polluting fuel. Because they were intended for emergency use generators have escaped most environmental regulations. What's more they are likely to be called into service on the hottest smoggiest days of the year. Carolyn Said in the San Francisco Chronicle -- 5/25/01 Power price controls -- The House Energy and Commerce Committee delayed consideration of a major energy bill Thursday as Republicans and Democrats met privately to explore a possible compromise placing price controls on soaring wholesale electric rates on the West Coast. The negotiations hinted at a possible watershed change in the Republicans' staunch opposition to price controls. An earlier effort to include such controls in the bill turned contentious and was defeated on a mostly partisan vote in subcommittee. Les Blumenthal in the Sacramento Bee -- 5/25/01 For seniors the heat can kill doctors warn -- As summer slouches toward Sacramento amid a drumbeat of calls to conserve electricity doctors and advocates for the elderly are sounding a counter-theme. Heat can kill. And most often it kills seniors. Year after year heat waves around the United States are deadlier than hurricanes or floods tornadoes or earthquakes according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Carrie Peyton and Nancy Weaver Teichert in the Sacramento Bee -- 5/25/01 Outages could be fatal for disabled -- Around the clock an electric pump supplies supplementary oxygen to 66-year-old Benny Pritchett's diseased lungs. Pritchett worries that a rolling blackout might kill him. The electricity goes out I'm a dead man said the San Bernardino apartment dweller and former chain-smoker. I've got a (back-up) oxygen tank. It lasts two hours. When it runs out I'm dead. Rolling blackouts aren't expected to last much more than an hour say Southern California Edison officials but their Web site recommends that any customer dependent on electrically operated life-support equipment buy an emergency generator. Richard Brooks in the Riverside Press -- 5/25/01 Gasoline prices -- Average gasoline prices statewide are nearly $2 a gallon and the Los Angeles region has once again been dubbed the nation's hub of traffic congestion. So what's a good Southern Californian to do? Plan a road trip. Hugo Martin in the Los Angeles Times -- 5/25/01 Offshore drilling -- A federal advisory panel Thursday urged the Bush administration to identify the five most promising areas to drill for natural gas in coastal waters off California and other states which have been off limits to drilling for nearly 20 years. Citing the nation's unmet energy needs the advisory group to Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton suggested that locating the top reservoirs of natural gas would help determine if there are grounds and support for a limited lifting of moratoriums on offshore drilling. The ban now covers 610 million acres of ocean off the Pacific Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Kenneth Weiss in the Los Angeles Times -- 5/25/01 Judge demands straight answers from El Paso Corp. -- An irate judge threatened yesterday to subpoena the president of a Texas energy firm accused of manipulating California natural gas prices saying he couldn't get straight answers out of another high-ranking company executive. The eruption by Curtis Wagner Jr. the administrative law judge presiding over a federal probe of alleged market manipulation by El Paso Corp. prompted the company to schedule voluntary testimony by President William Wise today in Washington D.C. Bernadette Tansey in the San Francisco Chronicle -- 5/25/01 El Paso executive and collusion -- The head of a Texas energy conglomerate personally endorsed a deal between two subsidiaries accused of manipulating the natural gas market in Southern California to drive up prices a senior official of the firm testified Thursday. The testimony in a trial-like hearing before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission raised questions about whether top officials of Houston-based El Paso Corp. violated FERC rules requiring arm's-length dealings within a corporate family. The admission by El Paso executive Ralph Eads marked a shift from his previous testimony and was elicited through sharp questioning by an angry judge who threatened to subpoena Eads' boss. Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar in the Los Angeles Times -- 5/25/01 Riverside no blackouts -- Southern California Edison won't immediately challenge Riverside's decision against using rolling blackouts to save energy this summer a spokesman said Thursday. Edison doesn't care how the city of Riverside curtails its energy use as long as the city makes the required cuts during a statewide power shortage Edison spokesman Steve Hansen said. Dan Lee in the Riverside Press -- 5/25/01 Energy crisis hits muni bonds -- Investors fled the California municipal bond market last month taking with them a net $3.5 billion their departure prompted in part by the state's energy crisis and taxes a fund analysis firm said Thursday. The withdrawals in April marked the worst such outflow in years and it comes as the state is preparing this August to issue a record $13.4 billion in bonds to bail out utilities. Loretta Kalb in the Sacramento Bee -- 5/25/01 With a perfectly negative crisis record Davis desperate for a win -- So far Gov. Gray Davis has amassed an unblemished record in his handling of the energy crisis. Not one major aspect of the situation has moved in the positive direction Davis said -- and clearly hoped -- it would to wit: Dan Walters in the Sacramento Bee -- 5/25/01 Hot days don't cut the power -- A combination of factors kept the state's beleaguered system out of the red this time. The heat wave didn't hit all areas of the state at the same time and cooler weather in the Pacific Northwest got power flowing from that region to California again. Also there have been no new power-plant malfunctions and many of the smaller generating facilities that were AWOL a few weeks ago when the last blackouts hit are operating again. A huge potential contributor to blackout avoidance -- but one that's difficult to quantify -- is conservation. Jack Katzanek in the Riverside Press -- 5/25/01 Long Beach Boeing layoffs -- Reflecting a sagging market for 100-seat jetliners the Boeing Co. will lay off about 600 employees this year at its commercial factory in Long Beach the company confirmed Thursday. That decision followed an internal study by Boeing that was completed earlier this year said spokesman Warren Lamb who did not elaborate. Ian Hanigan in the Long Beach Press -- 5/25/01 Hahn -- His job is to both prosecute and defend. And with that tricky mandate Los Angeles City Atty. James Kenneth Hahn for 16 years has led a law office that in sheer numbers would rank among the biggest in the country. With some 450 attorneys responsibility for both criminal and civil cases and an annual budget of $70 million the office like the city it serves is big diverse complex. But a review of Hahn's record suggests that his performance has been mixed--deliberate and plodding pragmatic and obstinate. Greg Krikorian and Patrick McGreevey in the Los Angeles Times -- 5/25/01 Villaraigosa and Hahn and housing -- It doesn't fire up voters like a stump speech on crime schools or traffic congestion. But the sheer magnitude of the city's housing shortage has placed it squarely--albeit quietly--on the agendas of both candidates running for mayor of Los Angeles. Eight years of a widely criticized lack of mayoral attention to the housing problem combined with a high concentration of low-wage workers has earned Los Angeles a reputation as one of the most unaffordable overcrowded metropolitan centers in the country plagued by low home ownership rates and slum conditions. Lee Romney in the Los Angeles Times -- 5/25/01 Villaraigosa and Hahn annd crime and gangs -- Mayoral candidates Antonio Villaraigosa and City Attorney James Hahn continued Thursday to compare their plans to deal with crime as they near the June 5 runoff election. Hahn filing papers in court to seek injunctions against two Wilmington gangs touted his efforts over the past several years to control gang activity throughout the city. The root of the violence is drugs and ... for turf and control Hahn said of the two gangs -- but which he added applies to most gangs in the city. Rick Orlov in the Los Angeles Daily News -- 5/25/01 Dean Andal -- State Board of Equalization member Dean Andal is expected to announce today that he plans to run for state controller next year. The 41-year-old Republican from Stockton said he will run on a platform that includes lowering utility taxes paid by residents and businesses in Los Angeles which are 10% and 12.5% respectively. The story is in the Los Angeles Times -- 5/25/01 Jim Rogan -- President Bush on Thursday nominated former Congressman James Rogan to be undersecretary of commerce for intellectual property and director of the U.S. Trademark Office. The job pays $130200 a year. Bush's selection of Rogan which will require confirmation by the Senate could be a positive sign for Hollywood which has been lobbying for increased enforcement of copyright laws including a crackdown on Internet piracy. Bill Hillburg in the Los Angeles Daily News -- 5/25/01 Living wage -- While attorneys speculated on the constitutionality of Santa Monica's newly approved living wage law hotel housekeeper Blanca Mendez was just hoping Thursday that she can benefit if a raise to $10.50 an hour goes into effect next summer at large downtown and beach-side businesses. It would be fantastic said Mendez who now earns $8.50 an hour after seven years at the Streamline Moderne-style Shangri-La Hotel near the ocean. The economy is very difficult everything is getting expensive like gas like energy. Oscar Johnson and Ofelia Casillas in the Los Angeles Times -- 5/25/01 9 tribes' casino plans put on hold -- Gov. Gray Davis won't approve any more agreements with Indian tribes to allow casinos until the federal courts resolve a legal challenge to California's Indian gaming law. So far the governor's moratorium on new Indian gaming compacts announced in a letter to nine California tribes doesn't appear to affect three Sonoma County tribes that have announced plans for casinos. But it could delay the progress of the nine other tribes that have asked the governor to negotiate gaming agreements including the Round Valley tribe in Mendocino County. Steve Hart in the Santa Rosa Press -- 5/25/01 Charity foundations growth -- California's charitable foundation assets--which were relatively modest as recently as two decades ago--are now growing at a rate faster than those in the rest of the country according to a study by the new USC Center on Philanthropy and Public Policy. In 1978 California held 8% of national foundation assets in 1998 it accounted for 14% the study said. During the same period the state's share of foundation grants grew from 7% to 11% of total giving nationwide it said. California is catching up and jumping forward said Marcia K. Sharp a research fellow at the USC Center on Philanthropy and Public Policy and a co-author of the study. Anne-Marie O'Connor in the Los Angeles Times -- 5/25/01 Documents seized in S.F. minority contract probe are inadmissible -- In a potential blow to prosecutors a U.S. judge said that federal investigators violated a San Francisco city official's privacy rights when they searched her office looking for evidence of fraud in a city minority contracting program. The FBI seized hundreds of pages of records from the San Francisco Human Rights Commission office of chief contract compliance officer Zula Jones in August 1999. Chuck Finnie and Lance Williams in the San Francisco Chronicle -- 5/25/01 Feinstein fast-tracks water storage plans -- California can't forestall a water crisis without building more storage facilities Sen. Dianne Feinstein said yesterday in responding to environmental critics of her bill to reauthorize the CalFed ecosystem restoration program. Eric Brazil in the San Francisco Chronicle Michael Gardner in the San Diego Union -- 5/25/01 Californians' recycling efforts hit skids -- Californians are recycling a lower percentage of redeemable plastic glass and aluminum beverage containers than they have in more than a decade the state Department of Conservation reported Thursday. While officials note the recycling drop is partially due to an increasing number of products available for redemption they also point to research suggesting consumers' habits may be slipping. Ed Fletcher in the Sacramento Bee -- 5/25/01 UC admissions policy -- A UC Berkeley request to be exempted from a University of California admissions policy is creating concern among administrators and faculty who object to looking at one campus in isolation. Instead they said the Berkeley request probably should be folded into a systemwide review of admissions already under way. Tanya Schevitz in the San Francisco Chronicle -- 5/25/01 Irvine cash crop: business -- Irvine One of the largest commercial developments in the county could be built in the next five to seven years replacing checkered fields of strawberries and other crops. The 670 acres of fields and a scattering of industrial buildings just outside Irvine's northeastern border is large enough to host 12 Disneylands but The Irvine Co. has other plans. Laura Corbin Jennifer Hieger and Elizabeth Aguilera in the Orange County Register -- 5/25/01 Like a Rolling Tone -- It looked like a scene from the hotel karaoke lounge where the microphone-hogging guy won't stop belting Tom Jones tunes and a few cocktail-sipping patrons keep their eyes glued to their drinks in embarrassment. But it was official state business at the state Capitol on Thursday when members of the Assembly attempted to pay tribute to Bob Dylan on his 60th birthday by feebly singing along with his 1973 recording of Forever Young. Lesli A. Maxwell in the Fresno Bee -- 5/25/01 Joe Lockhart -- Barely six months after joining Oracle Corp. as a communications consultant to chief executive Larry Ellison former White House press secretary Joe Lockhart has left the database software firm. Both sides yesterday denied a rift between the two men and blamed Lockhart's frequent trips from his home in Washington D.C. to Oracle's Redwood Shores headquarters for the departure.

Enron had made an original contribution to the library foundation back in 1998 totaling $250K over five years. I am working with Community Relations and A/A Recruiting to evaluate the latest request and to discuss where Enron may have interest or find leverage for our Government Affairs Recruiting or PR efforts. The Foundation is willing to work with us to establish whatever type of program(s) and/or participatory involvement we would like. We have discussed an Enron speaker series classroom lectures advisory committee seats and the likes. I have already had a chance to run this by Rick Shapiro and Rob Bradley. Although Rick was noncommittal regarding his team's time for speaking or lecturing he seemed supportive of the effort. Rob has already been participating in some speaking opportunities there and supported expanded efforts. What are your thoughts on contribution levels (another $250K was suggested by CR) and any specific program or relationship opportunities regarding the Library Center or School of Public Policy. Please grab me for quick conversation when you have time. Thanks. Mike [/INST] Category: Company Business, Strategy, etc.(elaborate in Section 3 [Topics])"

LOS ANGELES -- In the latest attempt to fix California's troubled deregulated energy market officials adopted a unique variable-pricing plan that already is being criticized by power generators and traders as unworkable and praised by utilities and consumers as much needed protection against gouging. Under the plan adopted late last week by the governing board of the California Independent System Operator or ISO a quasipublic agency responsible for maintaining electricity reliability in the state the cap on wholesale power will be reset hourly from about $65 per megawatt hour at low-demand times to no more than $250 an hour at periods of high demand. It was the third time this year that officials effectively lowered the price cap on wholesale electricity in a bid to contain -- so far unsuccessfully -- soaring total power costs. The move underscores the chaotic atmosphere prevailing in California's power market after a two-year-old experiment in deregulation has come undone. In other deregulated markets such as New York and New England prices are capped at $1000 per megawatt hour which are intended to be low enough to prevent market abuse but high enough to give generators incentive to build new plants. California's system was supposed to work the same way. But because utilities in California divested themselves of the bulk of their plants but weren't allowed to lock in fixed-price supply contracts unlike in the other markets merchant generators have had much greater sway over prices here on the spot market where most power trades. During the first nine months of the year the average price of wholesale electricity was $90 per megawatt hour in California triple the price of a year earlier. Even on cool days in October the price generally has remained above $100 per megawatt hour. California utilities have lost money on those power purchases because their customers' rates are frozen at $54 to $65 per megawatt hour far lower than the average price utilities have had to pay for that power. The deficits exceeded $5 billion in the June-to-September period. California utilities buy the power used by their customers from the state-sanctioned auctions administered by the ISO and a sister organization the California Power Exchange. In New York and New England by comparison less than 20% of power is purchased from the spot markets because utilities there were able to sign the fixed-price contracts which California utilities weren't allowed to do. The price-cap decision passed last week by a vote of 13 to 10 primarily with support from utilities and board members representing consumer interests. It was pushed aggressively by Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison the state's two big investor-owned utilities that have gotten caught in the price-spike vise this year. Some ISO members say they had no choice but to support the measure to ratchet down price caps. We're going after the windfall profits said S. David Freeman general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power who voted for the measure. What we've got now is a market accustomed to ripping off the consumer. This can't be allowed to go on. But other experts said the hasty measure may make California's problems even worse. The short-term regulatory fix is always to fix prices said Pam Prairie director of the Institute of Public Utilities at Michigan State University in East Lansing. But there's a real danger you'll set prices too low and make your supply problems even worse. Other economists agreed. At best this is poorly administered cost-based regulation said Frank Wolak an economics professor at Stanford University who sits on an independent market-monitoring committee at the ISO. At worst it creates all sorts of perverse market incentives. For example it may increase the problem of megawatt laundering on hot days in which in-state generators sell power to out-of-state customers who then sell it back into the state effectively bypassing the cap. Likewise it could encourage generators to build new plants outside of California rather than where they are needed near its major cities also to avoid the cap. In the end it could increase stresses to the state's already overburdened transmission system. In fact the decision already has brought to a halt the state's forward electricity market which allows wholesale customers to sign contracts for power they will use in the future. The market had been trading as much as 1000 contracts a week. On Friday there was practically no activity. This decision shows the height of lunacy said Rick Shapiro a managing director at Enron Corp. the giant Houston-based energy trader. Mr. Shapiro said Enron and other generators will file appeals at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission asking that the new pricing formula be rescinded. It is possible the FERC may throw out the pricing formula anyway. It is expected to issue a major order on Nov. 1 directing changes in California's market structure. That order will include its determination of the effectiveness of price caps. It also is expected to judge the merits of the governance structure at the ISO which has lately been marked by infighting. Recently consumer groups have charged that the ISO board has put the business interests of its members ahead of members' fiduciary duty to California residents. The most recent price-cap measure was approved over the objections of executives at the ISO whose job it will be to implement the formula. ISO Chief Executive Terry Winter said the measure is flawed because it doesn't take into account the amount of power available to the California market. Mr. Winter fears the caps will place the state at a disadvantage relative to neighboring states with no price caps. About 11 states are electrically interconnected in the West meaning power can be moved between them and chase the highest prices. We keep getting accused of making our market too complicated Mr. Winter said. Then along comes this proposal with caps that would adjust repeatedly throughout the day depending on demand.

Enron Offers Cash To Help Azurix Take Itself Private By Rebecca Smith Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/30/2000 The Wall Street Journal A12 (Copyright (c) 2000 Dow Jones & Company Inc.) Enron Corp. offered to lend Azurix Corp. an Enron spinoff $275 million so that it could take itself private. Enron which has been frustrated with the global water company's performance suggested Friday that public shareholders receive a cash offer of $7 a share for their Azurix stock. While nearly double the stock's value prior to the offer the suggested price nevertheless was far below the $19 at which Azurix made its debut in 1999. An Azurix spokeswoman said the board on which Enron has seats had not yet decided how to treat the Enron offer. An Enron spokesman said that taking the company private would give us more opportunity to directly affect our investment. In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday Azurix soared $3 to $6.56 in heavy trading. Azurix had hoped to create a splash by doing to the water business what Enron had done to the energy business -- increase competition and provide trading skills capable of creating new financial products out of old commodities. But Azurix stumbled nearly from the outset. Deregulation of the water business and government privatizations of water systems on which it was counting were slow to come crimping growth opportunities and profit. And Enron accustomed to higher faster returns grew impatient with the capital-intensive water business. The company's first chief executive Rebecca Mark a onetime head of Enron's international division resigned in the summer with the agreement of Enron executives who said it was time for new leadership. The incoming chief executive John Garrison said he would look for buyers for some of the company's businesses he was unavailable to comment Friday. Ms. Mark was believed to be considering making an offer for some of those businesses herself. She declined a request for an interview. In its letter to Azurix officers Enron said the water company received four offers from prospective suitors after Ms. Mark's departure the best of which came from an unidentified bidder who offered $7 a share and went through a lengthy due-diligence process before backing down apparently spooked by Azurix's cash flow capital structure tax considerations and some securities litigation. In its proposal letter made public Friday Enron said it concluded that there is no other buyer willing to pay the $7 and so proceeded with its own offer. But Enron said it won't try to limit Azurix's ability to negotiate a better deal with others should they come forward. Finally Enron noted that Azurix had considered various partial or full-liquidation alternatives but said they didn't seem likely to produce more than $7 a share.

Business Wessex switch likely Adam Jones in New York 10/28/2000 The Times of London News International 2W 64 (Copyright Times Newspapers Ltd 2000) Wessex Water's American parent company is likely to be taken private after a disastrous 14-month spell as a quoted company. Wessex which provides water services to the South of England was bought by Azurix in 1998 for Pounds 1.6 billion. Azurix wanted to use Wessex's expertise in privatised water supply to build a global business. However since listing at $19 a share in June last year Azurix stock has gone into freefall closing at less than $4 earlier this week. Azurix slumped because it drastically misjudged the number of privatisation opportunities. It emerged last night that Enron the Texan energy and trading company that is Azurix's biggest shareholder has taken the unusual step of offering to lend Azurix $275 million (Pounds 190 million) to buy its publicly held shares thereby taking it private. The Enron proposal would value Azurix at about $800 million or $7 per share - 63 per cent less than the IPO price. Enron would control Azurix and Wessex Water if it went private. Copyright  2000 Dow Jones & Company Inc. All Rights Reserved. BUSINESS Enron water unit could go private under loan plan NELSON ANTOSH Staff 10/28/2000 Houston Chronicle 3 STAR 1 (Copyright 2000) Enron offered Friday to lend Azurix its struggling water affiliate about $275 million so Azurix can go private by purchasing 38.6 million shares that are publicly traded. The deal would have Azurix buying back its stock at $7 per share about double what the shares were trading for Thursday. That's a big comedown for Azurix shares which sold for $19 each when the Houston company went public in June 1999. The maneuver technically can be called a take-under said analyst Carol Coale of Prudential Securities in Houston. She also described it as Enron's least painful solution for what to do with the venture that never lived up its ambitious plans. Nothing about Azurix has been positive for Enron in my view said Coale. This is a solution to a problem. Azurix spokeswoman Diane Bazelides said its board is studying Enron's proposal. She added that it was too early to comment on the offer because the proposal's structure had not been outlined. Enron imposed no deadline for a decision by Azurix but reserved the right to withdraw the offer if Azurix's position with prospective customers and employees deteriorated. One of Enron's conditions is that Azurix not sell any major assets before the buyout. The deal would not change Enron's large stake in Azurix said Palmer. It owns a third while the other third is owned by the Atlantic Water Trust in which Enron owns a 50 percent voting interest. The proposal's advantages include giving public shareholders a premium to the market price said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer. The common stock of Azurix zoomed Friday on the news gaining $3 to close at $6.56 on the New York Stock Exchange. Becoming a private company would give Azurix management greater flexibility in restructuring. Coale said it would reduce Azurix's general and administrative costs helping it to bid against lower- cost foreign competition particularly two big French companies. Azurix's high cost structure has been its primary problem she said. Azurix has been looking at cost and strategies ever since it got a new president and chief executive on Aug. 25 said Bazelides. That was the date that Rebecca Mark resigned as Azurix's high-profile chairman and chief executive. Enron and Azurix have been looking at strategic alternatives for nine months J. Mark Meets Enron's executive vice president for corporate development said in a letter filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. One alternative was selling the company he said. That didn't work out because the offers from three companies didn't exceed $4 per share. The fourth potential buyer said it would consider offering $7 per share said Meets. But that suitor backed out citing reasons like cash flow complexity of the capital structure tax considerations and pending securities litigation. We are obviously quite disappointed by this most recent turn of events Meets said in the letter. However we strongly believe that there is no other buyer willing to pay the $7 per share initially proposed (but later withdrawn) by the fourth bidder. Copyright  2000 Dow Jones & Company Inc.

Ken Herman American-Statesman Capitol Bureau Chief 10/28/2000 Austin American-Statesman A1 (Copyright 2000) Not long ago at a glossy wooden table in a Texas Capitol office two of Gov. George W. Bush's high-level appointees discussed one of the key issues in state government these days. It involved the relative merits of White House posts that could be available to the two appointees if Bush becomes president. Asked this week whether it's a common topic around the Capitol one of the appointees gestured to the anteroom of his office and made a motion indicating that even the midlevel folks have Washington on their minds. Near the banks of the Colorado Potomac Fever is a near-epidemic. And though it is political faux pas to be too open about doing White House transition planning before Election Day be assured it is going on at Bush headquarters where top officials are cognizant of the fine line between looking too confident now and looking too unprepared later. The candidate himself -- as well as his top aides -- steers clear of transition talk. When asked who might wind up in his Cabinet Bush looks backward instead of forward saying that his selection of Dick Cheney as his running mate should offer a glimpse of the kind of people who would wind up in his administration. The transition work such that it is is under the aegis of longtime Bush friend and aide Clay Johnson who began as head of the gubernatorial appointments office and now serves as chief of staff. Johnson said nobody has been interviewed for any Washington post but he has compiled a file of folks who are interested in serving in a Bush administration. Johnson also has been reading up on previous transitions -- ones that went well and ones that didn't. His preliminary conclusion is that the outgoing administrations are generally helpful and supportive even if they were ousted by the incoming administration. It's the incoming administrations that can make the mistakes he said. There is no shortage of think tanks that have think-tanked the topic. Back in August the Heritage Foundation based in Washington issued a transition handbook titled The Keys to a Successful Presidency. Though we really don't expect either campaign to talk about it (and would discourage them from doing so) the message here is it's time to start planning for a possible presidential transition quietly well behind the scenes but with the understanding that the preparation done during the next 70 or so days and the work done in the 70 or so days that follow (between the election and the inauguration) will very well determine the initial success or failure of the next administration Herbert Berkowitz a foundation vice president said in releasing the study. All indications are that the Bush team has been following the advice with Johnson at the helm. Johnson cautions against expectations that a Bush administration would be overloaded with Texans. It's the United States of America not the United States of Texas he said. Despite that caveat there is no shortage of Texans who are considered shoo-ins to fill some of the thousands of slots Bush could offer if he wins. Johnson confirms that he is very interested in a Washington job. Early speculation among Bush aides makes Johnson a potential leading contender for head of personnel at the White House. Karen Hughes Bush's communications director since his 1994 gubernatorial campaign is expected to become Bush's press secretary if he wins the White House. Karl Rove Bush's longtime political guru also will be on board though he could wind up with an out-of- the-White-House post perhaps at the Republican National Committee. Not as certain is the potential future for Joe Allbaugh who is part of the iron triangle of top advisers -- along with Rove and Hughes -- who have been on board with Bush since the 1994 campaign. Allbaugh serves as manager of the presidential campaign and previously served as chief of staff in the governor's office. Capitol speculation indicates Allbaugh could decide to skip a White House post possibly in favor of a lobbying job if he is not tapped as chief of staff. That post could go to Don Evans a longtime Bush friend who headed the megasuccessful fund-raising effort for the presidential campaign. However not everyone has Potomac Fever. For example Terral Smith Bush's legislative director said he will stay in Austin to lobby. In addition to the speculation about appointees the approaching election has sparked talk about when Bush might leave office if he wins. Under the U.S. Constitution he could remain governor until he has to become president on Jan. 20. Much more likely however is that Bush would leave office sooner than that perhaps as soon as two or three weeks after the Nov. 7 election if he wins. That could cause a housing problem for Bush whose main residence is the Governor's Mansion which comes as a free perk of the job. The Bushes have a home under construction at their ranch in Crawford near Waco. The ranch also has a smaller house in which the Bushes now spend weekends. Not out of the question is that Bush could work out an arrangement with Lt. Gov. Rick Perry who would become governor if Bush resigns to remain in the Governor's Mansion for several weeks after he leaves office. If the race among Texas senators to replace Perry as lieutenant governor complicates the timing of the resignation Bush could stay in the governor's office a little longer but no later than the first week of January. After all he will want to give Perry time to bask in his gubernatorial inauguration before the Legislature convenes Jan. 9. No matter when Bush resigns confidantes believe he might use his Crawford ranch for interviews with potential top-level appointees including Cabinet members.

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A Dynegy executive said Friday that the California Independent System Operator's plan to impose hourly price caps on the wholesale power market will compromise reliability by forcing generators to sell electricity out of state. If the ISO says it will not buy above a certain price and generators cannot operate below that price then we have no choice but to find other markets to participate in said Dynegy senior vice president of marketing and trading asset management Lynn Lednicky. That may lead to the ISO not finding the power it needs at a price it wants to pay. The ISO plans to construct hourly price caps each month based on forecast load natural gas prices and generation unit efficiency. The caps will take effect Nov. 3 or soon therafter. Dynegy Inc. (DYN) sent a letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission asking it to address reliability consequences of the price caps before Nov. 3. Dynegy specifically requested that FERC discuss the issue at its Nov. 1 meeting when it will release a report on California's electricity problems. Enron Corp. (ENE) and Southern Company (SO) share Dynegy's concerns about reliability and plan to petition FERC about the issue said a trader listening in to a conference call between the three companies. -By Jessica Berthold Dow Jones Newswires 323-658-3872 jessica.berthold@dowjones.com Copyright  2000 Dow Jones & Company Inc.

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES New York -(Dow Jones)- Shares of Azurix Corp. (AZX) jumped 84% in heavy trading Friday after parent Enron Corp. (ENE) proposed to take the company private in a $7-a-share buyout. Filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed that Enron made the proposal after not being satisfied with offers it had received from four third parties for its stake in Azurix. In a letter to two members of Azurix's board Enron said three potential buyers were unlikely to be willing to pay more than the then-current market price of approximately $4 a share. Enron said a fourth potential buyer indicated it would consider a $7-a-share offer but it said that proposal was recently withdrawn. The reasons given by the bidder included pro forma cash flows the complexity of the capital structure tax considerations and the currently pending securities litigation the letter said. Mark Palmer a spokesman for Houston-based Enron declined to say whether Enron was entertaining current third-party interests or was in any talks with other parties regarding its Azurix stake. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Azurix ended Friday up $3 to $6.56 on 2.8 million shares compared with average daily volume of 239000 shares. Enron was up $1.38 or 1.8% to $78.88 on 1.6 million shares compared with its daily average turnover of 2.4 million. In the SEC filing Enron saying it's familiar with Azurix's various partial and full liquidation alternatives said its buyout proposal is conditioned upon Azurix not selling any significant assets prior to the buyout. Although we agree that such plans may result in greater value to Azurix's shareholders than the maintenance of the status quo we believe that these options almost certainly will not result on a present value in a greater return to Azurix's shareholders than $7 a share the letter said. Enron also said its buyout proposal doesn't include any breakup fees or other deal protection devices. This frees Azurix's board to pursue an acquisition that might provide greater value to shareholders. Daine Bazelides a spokeswoman for Azurix declined to say whether Azurix is now entertaining offers for the company. She did however confirm the information contained in Enron's filing. The historical information in the filing is factually correct she told Dow Jones Newswires. She said she doesn't know when Azurix board will respond to Enron's proposal. In the filing Enron didn't set a deadline but warned that Azurix's position with customers and employees may deteriorate further. We must therefore reserve the right to withdraw our proposal at any time Enron's letter said. In the letter Enron pointed out that Azurix had retained two internationally recognized investment bankers early this year to evaluate strategic alternatives which included the potential sale of the company to unrelated third parties. Enron said it strongly believes there isn't another buyer willing to pay $7 a share for Enron's indirect interest in Azurix. We believe it is in Azurix's best interest as well as the best interest of its shareholders and employees if Azurix were no longer a publicly traded company Enron said. -By Christopher C.

Enron offers to buy out Azurix Financial Times By Hillary Durgin in Houston Published: October 27 2000 23:31GMT | Last Updated: October 27 2000 23:36GMT Enron the Houston-based energy and trading group said on Friday it had offered up to $275m in funding to take Azurix private at a buy-out price of $7 per share. The specific structure of Enron's proposal has yet to be determined Enron said. Azurix said its board would now consider the proposal. The timing of any decision was unclear. Enron owns directly and indirectly about 66 per cent of Azurix the troubled Houston water company whose main asset is UK-based Wessex Water. The buyout offer is the latest development in a history of problems at Azurix which was spun off from Enron and taken public at an offering price of $19 per share. But a combination of poor market timing competitive industry conditions and empty promises by the company on Wall Street took their toll on the company whose shares have since plummeted and have been trading most recently around the $3-per-share range. In August Rebecca Mark Azurix chief executive officer resigned both from Azurix and from the board at Enron. Enron's offer came after four unnamed parties approached Enron about buying its stake in Azurix. While three of the four were unwilling to pay more than the then market price of about $4 per share a fourth party who was considering offering $7 per share (before accounting for any dilution for stock options) later declined to pursue the transaction Enron said in Friday's letter to Azurix outlining the buyout proposal. We strongly believe that our proposal is fair to Azurix's public stockholders the letter stated. Our proposed transaction would permit Azurix's stockholders to receive on a timely basis a cash payment for their shares that is significantly above the price at which those shares have traded in several months. Analysts that follow Azurix and had valued the shares at between $6 and $8 per shares said the offer was fair. Analysts that follow Enron said that Azurix's business strategy had proved to be a failure and was characteristic of the hard asset approach that Enron has gradually distanced itself from. Enron's shares closed at $78.88 up $1.38 on Friday. Azurix's shares rose $3 to close at $6.56. [/INST] Category: Company Business, Strategy, etc.(elaborate in Section 3 [Topics])"

Mr. Skilling's office is hesitant to allocate more than two hours without your recommendation. Emerson is being persistent. The key players from Emerson are David Farr newly appointed CEO and James Berges President and effectively the leader of Emerson's strategic development effort. It is anticipated that both would attend the meeting. Emerson execs want to (i) get to know Mr. Skilling and other senior management (ii) discuss mutual business opportunities and (iii) hold a discussion about the transformation of Enron from a pipeline company to its current form. The last point has to do with Emerson's continuing self-transformation effort and how Enron achieved its transformation. I need your advice and recommendation. Please respond by e-mail or telephone (x5-4040). Background: Emerson initiated this latest round of contact with Enron in November 2000 when Mike Train and Mark Proudfoot both Emerson VPs of Corporate Development visited the Enron building hosted by Steve Kean. I met them at that time. Since that initial meeting Emerson has aggressively pursued a business joint venture as preferred supplier with Martin Wenzel and the distributed power business I believe with promising results. My sense is that Emerson is uniquely positioned as EES' partner in that business. I am waiting to receive an update from Martin. Emerson is also interested in becoming a preferred supplier for EES's DSM business. While we generally support that idea we are pressing Emerson to reciprocate by becoming a customer of our bundled outsource business. Emerson is highly decentralized and our efforts to date have been unsuccessful. I want to use the meeting as an opportunity to press Emerson to consider a proposal from EES's bundled outsource business. Please let me know your recommendation on this matter. Thanks Nate ----------------- [/INST] Category: Logistic Arrangements(meeting scheduling, technical support, etc)"

I also can tell you that the feedback from participants regarding your briefing has been terrific. We are reviewing all the material this week to begin the process of re-creating the session on the Secretary's webpage for the Forum and I will be going over the video and audio clips for posting. Recognizing that your slides were proprietary it would be most valuable if we could post as much of your powerpoint briefing as possible--whatever you feel comfortable with sharing. Whatever that turns out to be if your staff could email that to me I will make sure that only that and not the original that you sent to me gets posted. I am not sure where the senior leadership of the DoD will be going in the coming months however I know that the discussion of your experience at Enron and the experiences of your panel mates will have an influence. A more formal letter of thanks will be forthcoming but for now thank you again for joining us and helping to make this a memorable and most important Highlands Forum.

We believe that relief is best provided by giving San Diego the ability to procure power on a fixed price basis from the market. San Diego has offers in front of it now those should be evaluated and the legislature and the commission should give San Diego the flexibility to accept one or more of them. This is sounder than running huge deferrals (deficits) to be later recovered from consumers. Rate relief should be accompanied by real reform. Rate caps have bad long term consequences: they cause shortages. Combining short-medium term rate relief with expedited siting of new facilities will address the near term problem while laying the proper groundwork for a long term solution.

Mr Lay's letter will serve as an introduction to Jeff Skilling and will also permit Enron Japan to follow up directly with Mr Okuda's staff in Japan.

I've answered them to the extent they involve legal/regulatory issues. If you need anything further please don't hesitate to call. ? Can a new shipper who enters into an FTS-1 contract with zero MDQ in order to purchase a shipper call option or sell a transporter put option be allowed prior to the exercise date to transfer the underlying option rights by permanently releasing this contract? YES. ? Will we be required to report these contracts with zero MDQ on the Index of Customers and/or the Transactional Report? YES. ? Can the releasing shipper permanently release a portion of his existing MDQ and choose to keep or transfer the option rights? YES. The shipper could even release all of its MDQ (reducing it to zero) and keep its option rights. ? How is it determined whether a contract with an option amendment is within the min/max tariff rate or needs to be filed as a negotiated rate? The option fee is converted to a per-Dth per day rate and added to the transport rate. If the total exceeds the maximum tariff rate it's negotiated. Otherwise our position is that it's not negotiated. We are not 100% positive that FERC will agree with us on this issue.

From today's Post. Davis seems to continue to put distance between himself and the contracts. Best Jeff Financial California Changes Stance on Refunds Two Sides Far Apart In Energy Talks Peter Behr 07/06/2001 The Washington Post FINAL Page E01 Copyright 2001 The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity  saying they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43 billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year. Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term contracts whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for Davis. We've made suggestions we've offered various ways in which people could get us $8.9 billion Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday. You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you want to do it it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion. The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr. according to sources close to the negotiations. Yesterday Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach a compromise. What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood Wagner told reporters. In the event we're unable to do that [Friday] at some point I may offer a preliminary assessment. The settlement conference is set to conclude on Monday. Wagner FERC's chief administrative judge has been trying to push both sides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy. Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California 's largest utility drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on. Last Friday Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative Michael Kahn chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in refunds from power generators and marketers was too high sources said. Wagner's settlement conference which has involved more than 100 lawyers for all sides is closed to the public and media. Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a joke that the parties might as well wear clown suits according to a Dow Jones report confirmed by sources close to the talks. But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers led by Reliant Energy Inc. Williams Energy Services Duke Energy and Southern Co. for failing to make serious settlement offers these sources said. The suppliers have offered to refund $600 million provided the state is able to call off various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds sources said. Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds but now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California 's electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher refund figure some energy analysts believe. Davis's tactical change offering to make the long-term contracts part of an overall settlement comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have to pay for energy under those deals. California 's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed deregulation plan which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at volatile spot market prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer so did the state's electricity bills. In response Davis's aide S. David Freeman and his staff began negotiating long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years. That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was paying at the beginning of this year but above current power prices -- and considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade energy analysts say. A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count as a refund because the deals were reached under commercial duress according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations. Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify. There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be said Michael Zenger California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a just and reasonable standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure. It's not rocket science but it does require the regulators to regulate said Frank Wolak a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight committee for the California grid. Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room billions of dollars apart as the talks approached their final weekend sources said.

Everyone is getting into the act. When I started this gig I was the only guy in town writing to folks like you about the power industry in California. I wrote about what?s new what?s happening and all the important stuff. This week Governor Gray Davis decided to write his own Burrito. His epistle got more press than mine but why is he muscling in on my turf? Not to be outdone PUC President Loretta Lynch released a report which looks into every facet of California?s power business. No stone left unturned. I?m telling you there isn?t enough room in this business for all of us. They need to clear out. With people like Herr (Hair?) Peace Governor I?m-Not Mr.-Rogers Davis and Let?s Do Lynch who needs a Friday Burrito? They re-define our reality each week with mind-numbing aplomb. For example starting in early June the PX was ordered to compete for business against other Qualified Trading Vehicles. Then two weeks later the Energy F_hrer legislated that idea to an early death which kept the status quo for at least one year. This week the PUC approved 5-year bilateral deals for PG&E and SCE thereby opening the PX to competition and emasculating the PX?s Block Forward Market. Zip bam boom. I can?t wait to see what next week will bring. I hear Senator Bowen is holding Committee hearings on re regulating the industry and the Governor?s new Energy Security Council will meet to decide six things: What?s for lunch? Who will sit at the head of the table? Does anyone have good seats for next week?s Democratic convention? Is there anyone we haven?t indicted yet in the power industry? Who will crank up the air conditioning in this room? It?s getting too warm. Then they will collect data from innocent businesses under subpoena ignore the facts and publish a report. It makes one want to take a deep breath and inhale the scented fumes of democracy. You know I can?t think about where to begin so let?s start somewhere. >>> Things on the Island of California @@@ Is there anyone left at SDG&E with a brain? @@@ The PUC issues its scathing report @@@ The ISO invokes $250 price caps. Duh! >>> Things at the throne of FERC @@@ Amen for the Morgan Stanley Order >>> Odds and Ends (_!_) >>> Things on the Island of California @@@ Is there anyone left at SDG&E with a brain? Well the answer very clearly is no. I have been astounded by repeated attempts of SDG&E?s most senior people to ape humans but instead they mimic apes. Consider the following. First they waltz their default customers into the summer with little of no protection from price spikes in the wholesale market. Forgivable in that it is human to err. The prices skyrocket in June and they start looking for who to blame. _Must be them damn independent generatorsO say their managers. Gary Cotton informs the ISO Governing Board that hedging SDG&E?s position in the Block Forward Market wouldn?t have made any difference. There?s one nobel laureate who missed his prime. Next under pressure they ask for help from suppliers and anyone else who will assist the utility and their customers. Nine offers show up at their table and they can?t choose any of them. Again Mr Cotton tells his fellow ISO Governing Board members that these things take time and we don?t to rush since there are many legislative barriers and well the surfing was good this week so why spoil it? Now they are in a panic because the Energy F_hrer is visiting old ladies living in trailer parks advising them not to pay their SDG&E electricity bill and to continue to operate their air conditioners. SDG&E puts a full page ad in the local newspaper telling everyone that SDG&E is doing everything it can to lower their electric bills including asking the ISO for a $250 price cap but the public can help by calling the ISO [address and phone number provided in the ad] and urging them to lower the cap. I always thought the location of the ISO was a State secret for security reasons. No secrets in San Diego. But we are not done. No sir we are not. Those buffalo heads who run that company decide they will win a gold star on their collective foreheads and implement one of the four resolutions passed by the Electric Oversight Board. The one they pick is to petition FERC on an expedited basis to cap at $250 the price at which sellers may bid energy or ancillary services into the ISO and the PX. The primary reason is that Western power markets are not workably competitive. In other words they want FERC to set a max price on what generators can sell in addition to the price limit at which the ISO can buy! What I find most astounding about this double talk is that SDG&E continues to collect tons of money from the sales of regulatory must run energy into the PX. These are sales from their stranded assets. Their grief hasn?t abated their greed. So to recap SDG&E missed the boat on price hedging failed to win consumer confidence in public meetings asked for help from suppliers and did nothing in response then filed at FERC to cap the sale price because the wholesale market into which they sell (over-priced?) energy is not workably competitive. Too much time in the direct sun light. >>> Things on the Island of California @@@ The PUC issues its scathing report The PUC report released yesterday is a gem with which I have not spent enough time. I only read the Executive Summary and that only because our counsel Dan Douglass forwarded me a copy. Let me pick out some of the gems in President Lets Do Lynch?s burrito. I would recommend reading the whole text if you have time and if you seek perverse entertainment. _California is experiencing major problems with electricity supply and pricing caused by policies and procedures adopted over the past ten years. _ Since June wholesale prices for electrical power in California have increased on average 270% over the same period in 1999 resulting in over $1 billion in excess payments for electricity. _Hot weather aging power plant and transmission infrastructure and dysfunctional bidding behavior in the wholesale power markets combined to drive prices up ... _Because of serious market defects and tight supply of electricity purchasers of California power will likely pay billions more in electricity costs this year. Moreover these price increases do not necessarily fund new investments in electricity supply or delivery reliability - they may flow solely to power producer profit margins. _Despite the Electricity Oversight Board's legislative mandate to oversee those institutions we have been unable to obtain [bid] data. Nevertheless ...  we believe enough evidence of questionable behavior exists that the Attorney General should conduct an investigation into these statewide market practices coordinating with other State agencies including the PUC and the EOB. Such an investigation would provide the factual foundation that California policy makers and regulators need to recover any illegally obtained profits. _A momentous consequence of California's attempt to create a market in electricity is that the federal government now regulates California's electric system. Washington D.C. now controls pricing decisions directly at the wholesale level and indirectly at the retail level and to the extent that supply incentives are correlated to prices Washington D.C. now affects California's ability to attract new investment in power plants. _Past administrations' willingness to cede the State's authority to the federal government combined with the legislative creation of two non-public supervisory organizations that have no duty to protect the public or consider the retail customer. The Independent System Operator (ISO) and the Power Exchange (PX) the nonprofit private corporations that operate the State's transmission system and control wholesale pricing policies are governed by boards whose members can have serious conflicts of interest. Some of these board members or their companies financially benefit from higher prices in electricity markets. Neither of these private organizations is accountable to the State or its consumers .... _Despite the federalization and the fragmentation of the State's electric services the State of California should protect its businesses and consumers from cartel pricing collusive behavior inadequate power plant maintenance and lack of market planning for adequate electricity supplies. _California consumers and businesses deserve to know in advance - as San Diegans did not this summer - how and when the price of an essential service like electricity will double. California is now largely constrained by federal mandates from providing comprehensive retail price relief as long as wholesale prices remain so high. If California tried to re-impose a price freeze in San Diego now federal regulators would likely prevent that action. ... Short-term price relief however cannot resolve market gaming or fundamental wholesale pricing problems controlled by federal regulators. _We have been precluded from obtaining the data necessary to know if the ISO and PX failed to detect manipulation and gaming on several fronts. We do not know how market players acted in price offering and bidding and scheduling. The FERC has just announced an inquiry into national pricing and energy market issues. California should not wait for national findings before it investigates California market practices. We recommend that the California Attorney General immediately subpoena relevant records and data to determine the pricing and offering behavior of market participants the actions of the ISO and its board members and the actions of generators in supplying California's energy needs. _Ten Actions to Consider or Act Upon to Prevent Current Electricity Problems From Spreading in 2001: ... 2. Create a California Energy Council modeled on the National Security Council to unify State action to resolve energy problems and to perform integrated energy planning 3. Ask FERC for extended wholesale price cap authority to moderate California wholesale market pricing 4. Ask FERC to recognize the defects in the California and western regional markets and find that no competitive market exists in California power markets ... 8. Eliminate potential conflicts of interest in ISO/PX stakeholder boards 9. Improve California's ability to obtain ISO and generator data and enhance the State's enforcement capability for power plant maintenance price manipulation and generation gaming consistent with protection of proprietary business information 10. Provide the EOB with effective enforcement ability and additional oversight authority for the ISO and PX. _Ten Issues to Consider or Act Upon Within the Next Six Months: ... 4. Streamline state power plant siting procedures consistent with environmental requirements and prioritize applications to advance clean BACT+ power plant proposals. 5. Institute use-it -or- lose-it permitting power plant licensing and emissions credits rules to ensure power plants get built ... 8. Reform PX pricing protocols and structures to lower wholesale and retail prices and reduce excess profitsO I told you I don?t need to write a Burrito anymore. The Democrats in Sacramento are doing that for me. Welcome comrade. >>> Things on the Island of California @@@ The ISO invokes $250 price caps. Duh! It is really hard to describe the drama of an ISO Governing Board meeting especially when our favorite topic arises. It seems the only time the Board becomes animated is when one of three issues are on the agenda: price caps FTRs and priorities for software enhancements. Otherwise its pretty much hum-drum. %Round and %round we went once again. A few more forced votes tipped the scale in favor of the cap. There were 15 yes votes which included a forced yes vote from our friend Jerry Toenyes by order of Secretary of Energy Mr. Richardson. [Jerry did you realize that the last letters of your name could be re-arranged to spell _NO ET YESO? Kind of a french thing.] I?m sorry about that vote Jerry. You still go in my book as one of the brave and bold for standing up to that sort of intimidation for so long. Your picture in the SF Chron said it all. The brave souls who stood tall and voted NO included David Parquet (Enron) Jan Smutny-Jones (IEP) Barbara Barkovich (CLECA) Caolyn Kehrein (CMA) Dan Kirshner (EDF) and Stacy Roscoe (Procter & Gamble). Now I must admit that Dynegy?s Greg Blue did help by voting a Texas No spelled _A-B-S-T-A-I-NO. I have instructed Dynegy trader Dave Francis in Houston to work with Greg to correct that problem. We?re going to work things out. The Energy F_hrer addressed the Board again. I didn?t mind that I only had a few brief very brief moments to address the Board and Herr (Hair?) Peace got over 20 minutes. That didn?t bother me at all. He did more damage to himself in 20 than I could do in 2. He blasted away at everyone who opposed him. He pined about Camden quitting the Board. He said he knew how prices and markets work that it isn?t the way those academic egg-head FERC-loving economists tell you who pray to the gods of competition. He lambasted WAPA for withholding generation to protect fish and wildlife (what was that all about?). He predicted that on Thursday?s PUC meeting he and all the other powerful Democrats Republicans and angry citizens of San Diego would demand that the PUC impose a rate cap on retail electric rates in San Diego that are just and reasonable (it didn?t happen). And on and on and on. This man is very delusional. He believes that Steve and only Steve Peace can save the world. He believes that political will trumps judicial quasi-judicial or independent Board actions. This man makes relevant all the abstract musings of the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900) ... The will to power the ?bermensch the transvaluation of values etc. But we are getting under (uber?) his skin with the help of the press. Wednesday afternoon I called Commissioner Dick Bilas to see if he thought whether the next day?s PUC meeting was going to be a roll over. Dick said he got a call from Peace and that Peace said he would not come to the meeting. Apparently Peace had received a lot of press and all of it bad. That?s the thin line of freedom which keeps tyranny at least one step away from our front door. >>> Things at the throne of FERC @@@ Amen for the Morgan Stanley Order And now the good news. You deserve this. FERC gave the California market a little wiggle room last Friday. FERC issued a last minute reply to the complaint by Morgan Stanley Capital Group relating to the ISO?s intent to lower the price cap. FERC denied the complaint but they didn?t waste time with an Order to simply deny a complaint. FERC danced on the head of the ISO and pulled the bite out of the price cap. Here are some excerpts: _We accepted this [Amendment 21] not because it was a cap on sellers? prices but because it would promote order and transparency in the market by clearly telling sellers of the maximum price the ISO was willing to pay and allowing sellers to make informed economic choices on whether to sell in the ISO market or to sell elsewhere... _ ... The ISO has no more or less ability to procure capacity and energy than any other buyer of these services ... If the ISO is unable to elicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced purchase price ceiling (because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they choose) it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to meet its needs. ... Therefore an increase in out-of-market (OOM) calls for generation may be necessary to maintain system reliability. Because the current payment for OOM is not subject to a maximum purchase price the resulting overall payments may be higher. _To the extent the ... ISO Board resolution contemplates implementing a directive that generators must bid their capacity into the ISO markets under any circumstances (e.g. when system load exceeds 38000 MW) such a requirement is not permitted by our ... Order and the ISO tariff. ... Future implementation of the ISO Board resolution with regard to a requirement to sell would require significant revisions to the ISO market rules. Such market changes could not become effective absent a corresponding amendment to the ISO tariff which would have to be filed under section 205 of the FPA.O Well. What do you think about that? Just wait. Here is what the sleeping bear Commissioner Hebert said in his concurring remarks: _Getting to the bottom of the problem in my view requires us to begin a proceeding to rescind our approval of the ISO as the operator of the California grid. The record supports such a move. ... A memorandum to the ISO from a stakeholder who resigned from the governing board eloquently brings to our attention repeated attempts to undermine the independence of the ISO. The memorandum also thoughtfully outlines consequences to the markets of a return to %command and control.? _Because these allegations come from a non-market participant especially should we take heed. We must also take notice of the public pressure on the Board to compromise its independence.O Amen brother amen. >>> Odds and Ends (_!_) As you can imagine this week like an endless string of weeks before this has been interminable. I get about three phone calls a day from press reporters very little of which ever sees print. My shtick is just too complex for casual readers. But I do notice that the reporters are asking better questions. The public is becoming more savvy. The information flow is moving in our favor and will disarm the forces of evil in about 10 years. I have other problems on my mind. I am working on a new computer system. Really it?s just an upgrade of an older computer that is a bit faster than the laptop I tried to upgrade very unsuccessfully. As a result of the all the new hardware and software I purchased my office looks like a war zone with an odd mix of PUC service copies computer documentation and diskettes laying all around. Quite a mess. Prepare for the future. Our next general meeting is scheduled for Thursday and Friday October 5 and 6 at Moro Bay. Barb Ennis will prepare a blurb for us in next week?s Burrito about room reservations timing golf etc. Our guest speakers will include MSC Chairman Professor Frank Wolak who will talk on the subject of his choice Ms. Irene Moosen of Grueneich Resource Advocates who will make a presentation on the distributed generation case before the PUC and William Freddo of PG&E National Energy Group who will give us some education on operating a power plant inside the New England ISO. Now for your daily bread provided this week by Dan Douglass. Last week we had a joke about Catholics. This week it?s agnostics. ===================== An atheist was taking a walk thru the woods admiring all that the accident of evolution had created. What majestic trees! What powerful rivers! What beautiful animals! he said to himself. As he was walking alongside the river he heard a rustling in the bushes behind him. As he turned to look he saw a 7 foot grizzly bear charging towards him. He ran as fast as he could up the path. He looked over his shoulder and saw that the bear was closing in on him. He tried to run even faster so scared that tears were coming to his eyes. His heart was pumping frantically as he tried to run even faster but he tripped and fell on the ground. He rolled over to pick himself up and saw the bear right on top of him raising its paw to kill him. At that instant he cried out Oh my God! And time stopped. The bear froze. The forest was silent. The river even stopped flowing. A bright light shone upon the man and a voice out of the sky said You deny my existence all these years teach others I don't exist and even credit my creation to a cosmic accident and now do you expect me to help you out of this predicament? Am I to count you as a believer? The atheist ever so proud looked into the light and said It would be rather hypocritical to ask to be counted as a believer after all these years but could you make the bear a believer? Very well said the voice. And the light went out the river flowed the sounds of the forest continued and the bear brought both paws together bowed his head and said Lord I thank you for this food which I am about to receive. ================== Amen. And have a great weekend. Oh and thanks to all of you who sent me happy birthday wishes. It was very much appreciated.

Here are the facts we have so far. On November 4th the CPUC filed a motion with FERC to adopt the form of protective order that the CPUC entered to compel the production of documents and to shorten time to answer. According to Exhibit B (read to me by Nancy Pickover at Bracewell) the following CPUC moved against the following entities: AES Williams Duke Dynegy Reliant and Southern. Enron entities were NOT named in exhibit B. This is not to say that we could not be easily added to the group. While the motion reads as if the CPUC was moving against everybody in fact in footnote 2 they state they are only moving against the entities named in Exhibit B.

From: John Hardy@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on 05/10/2001 09:48 AM To: Rebecca McDonald/Enron@EnronXGate cc: Ben Glisan@ECT Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron Rob Walls/ENRON@enronXgate Subject: USG overtures on Dabhol Rebecca At a meeting yesterday at OPIC on Trakya another of our problem projects Dabhol was raised. A representative from the White House transition team joined the conversation. I was asked the terms under which we were prepared to negotiate and I told them at a minimum upon a commitment by the Indian authorities to serious negotiations which would include full compliance with the terms of the contracts and progress in the reform of the MSEB. I made clear that we do not see the Godbole Committee as the basis for such a discussion. I think the USG wants to be on record politically encouraging the Indian Govt. to engage in discussions all parties consider to be meaningful in hopes of working things out before it is too late even while through OPIC and EXIM it is supporting the move towards PNT. The administration may be concerned that without such a diplomatic overture on its part it could be concluded that the USG has politically taken a position on the project. In Trakya for example the USG has been quite proactive in pressing the Turkish govt on the payments issue and even in discussing the payment concerns with the IMF so that the payments issues for the BOTs (two of the four in Turkey are US sponsored) are taken into account as the IMF program moves forward. So I anticipate that the USG will shortly be meeting with the Indian ambassador here and the US Charge in Delhiwill likely be directed to make the rounds and meet with senior government officals on the project. I wanted you to be aware of this also any guidance you can provide would be helpful. Thanks John [/INST] Category: Personal but in professional context(e.g., it was good working with you)"

I think the electricity section needs some additions though. There is not a lot that the current administration can do about siting new plants and power lines -- its largely a state and local decision. Further the problem has been less about government failing to provide adequate incentives to utilities than it has been about a failure of the current commission to opening the grid on a nondiscriminatory basis. Once utilities are in the open access transmission business they will look for ways to invest in the grid and stop getting in the way of independent power producers who want to connect to the grid. The answer is open access so power can get from where it is to where it is needed. This has been clear for a long time yet the current administration (and its appointees on FERC) have yet to use their authority to make this happen. The result: spiking prices and reliability problems.

To: Gabriel cc: David Frank Shawn Elaine Bill Donovan/EPSC/HOU/ECT@ECT Melinda Winkler@ECT Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES Subject: Re: Security Assessment Report Gabriel et al: Looks like the risks to Enron travelers to (and employees in) Colombia have increased. This is another indication that a 'travel policy' for travelers to Colombia should be in effect. What happened to the one we were discussing earlier? The steps outlined there would go a long way in improving the security of our travelers. Control Risks' report discusses responses to the media - be sure you have the approval of Enron's media people before making any response. The report also recommends suspending bidding on new projects - probably not viable advice but reinforces the importance that additional security measures be built into all new projects from day one. Now that our name is in front of the Colombian public we could see retaliation for various acts not all of which we have control over. Recent US Government actions such as extraditing criminals to the US for trial and training Colombian anti-drug troops have done little to endear American businesses to the Colombian public who see such actions as interfering with Colombia's right to govern themselves. These actions have significantly raised the risk of all American companies and their employees in Colombia. A meeting I had about two years ago with David Beddow of Control Risks in Bogota indicated that we could see some changes in the methods of attack in urban areas by FARC/ELN. With an elevated risk level we should begin thinking about these threats. FARC seldom uses the car bomb method of attack because it generates little interest among the domestic or international media. FARC plans on using letter bombs mailed to select targets i.e. head of an American-owned corporation who may have an office in Bogota. This method will generate headlines in the press and generate a fear of FARC among businessmen who may be targets. Control Risks' reported timetable for this change in FARC's tactics was to be three to five years but now that our risk is higher the timetable may well be moved up. On a related note - did you employ the security person we recommended? Please let me know how I can help you.

The problem was this: Daly insisted someone speak on behalf of the group to the press (and designated Terry to be the one) Terry did not have the updated information that we were about to meet with the government officials and deliver a slightly different message (i.e. that we needed to know if the government planned to really open Petrobras or not -- the implication being that we would work within either decision but we needed to know one way or the other) Terry was simply not in possession of this information and no one had given it to him (probably because they had no reason to assume that Terry would be thrust in front of the press) moreover it's hard to see how Terry could have taken such a position publicly anyway. By my eyes Terry did the best he could and we had an unavoidable communications bust.

Who would have guessed that the California power crisis and Gray Davis could be so funny. Kevin Los Angeles Daily News Friday June 22 2001 'Tonight Show' pokes fun at power crisis By Fred Shuster Staff Writer BURBANK -- Jay Leno pulled the plug on his late-night chat show Thursday doing his part for the state's energy crisis but viewers weren't left in the dark. Flashlights mining helmets and multicolor glow sticks helped to illuminate the set for the show dubbed a one-time-only The Tonight Show Unplugged which Leno said saved enough electricity to light a house for a month. [IMAGE] The unplugged edition of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno pokes fun at the California power crisis(Reed Saxon / A.P.) Call it NBC's Can't See TV. This is not some cheap rating ploy. ... If this works they're gonna make us do this every night Leno joked as part of his opening monologue. The nationally broadcast show featuring a comic interlude with California Gov. Gray Davis utilized just a small amount of electricity to run the cameras Leno said before the show began. Actually in Burbank where the taping took place at NBC Studios the city owns the power company and residents and businesses have not been hit by rolling blackouts as in other areas. The city made $5 million in profit in May after racking up $60 million in excess power sales. But Leno said not using studio lights TV monitors amplifiers and other power sources Thursday saved enough electricity to light a four-bedroom house for a month. Members of the house band wore miner's helmets with group leader Kevin Eubanks strumming an acoustic guitar rather than his regular electric instrument. The stage was lit by candles torches and flashlight beams trained on Leno. Members of the studio audience used the gear to help brighten the set. This is real goofy Leno said before taping got under way. We'll see what happens. Guests included Arsenio Hall Gilbert Gottfried a trainer of nocturnal animals and a Hawaiian fire dancer -- and a brief visit from the governor. Exuding whatever is the direct opposite of charisma Davis had a brief exchange with Leno drawing laughs with the line This is the first time Gray Davis and (the word) electricity have ever appeared in the same sentence. Leno's staff wore glasses with small lights attached and audience prompter Bob Perlow held a hand-scrawled applause sign aloft throughout the show instead of switching on the usual electric model. While there was little energy in play there was no shortage of laughs. Leno joked that President George W. Bush told Davis not to worry because I've been operating in the dark for years. Those in the studio said Leno's nocturnal transmission added excitement to the program. It was cool said Lillie Harrell 17 a tourist from Hammond La. The crowd got really involved. I guess it shows you don't really need all those lights. Added Jose Tano 21 a Burbank resident and student at the University of California Los Angeles It was a good idea and a great way to make a point. The local power company might not have made out very well but the studio audience didn't end up empty-handed. Each received a fluorescent lantern and pack of batteries as they left the studio.

Sellers are exporting power from California to the Northwest. gas -- balance of the month gas in California was trading at $26-27 with Jan trading at $19 feb at $12-14 and Summer at $8. The Cal gas and power utilities remain unhedged (price caps are in place for retail power and utilities continue to buy power from the ISO and PX while gas utilities we believe are primarily buying at spot prices even under their long term deals). The power utilities will continue to book large deferrals and gas utilities will be passing costs through a month or two after incurring them. The impact of the gas price increases will begin showing up in Jan billings to consumers. curtailment rules (gas): More work to be done here but it appears that gas utilities will curtail deliveries in the following order: interruptible first (with some priority for cogens) firm service (with utilities alternating or rolling between generation load and nongeneration load) and core customers last.

In the Senate: The Senate bill 78XX is with about 90% likelihood going to be voted out of the Senate tonight---without a vote having taking place in any committee. Burton announced during one of the two informational hearings that this is it despite the view of just about everyone who appeared before the committees the bill likely won't prevent Edison from going bankrupt. The key features of the bill are: Banks and QFs get paid in full. Edison shareholders would be responsible for debts owed to suppliers No direct access. There are conflicting reports about whether the Senate will take up the bill tomorrow de-linking the bonds from the DWR contracts and whether the Republicans will go along with it. In the Assembly: The Committee is hearing the Wright and Hertzberg bills as we speak with Hertzberg's the likely winner. That bill now provides for Direct Access under certain conditions (the amendments describing the conditions were faxed today). We're attempting to get the July 12 date changed to the effective date of the bill or later. The Assembly likely won't vote the Hertzberg bill out until tomorrow at the earliest. The Problem: The Assembly and Senate bills are diametrically opposed in the way each approaches the problem---in short the bills are two ships passing in the night. The Democratic leaders (Governor Hertzberg Burton) aren't talking and Burton hasn't expressed any interest in talking---to anybody. The likely outcome given the circumstances: Burton says he's done what he needs to do (i.e. passed out a fair bill) the Assembly and Senate can't agree they finish the budget time runs out they leave Friday and Edison's left twisting. That said there's still a chance that the Governor could call Burton and sit down with Burton and Hertzberg and work something out by Friday or begin talking and postpone the recess until they get it worked out. But given Burton the chance of that happening seems very slim. In short little has changed since yesterday.

Terminate the OBA by giving 30 days notice to Burlington. Paragraph 13 of the 6/1/94 OBA with Burlington (as successor in interest to Meridian) provides that either party may terminate the OBA at the end of the primary term or thereafter by providing thirty (30) days prior written notice to Burlington. (The one-month primary term ended June 30 1994 and has since gone month-to-month.) 2. On the effective termination date of the OBA terminate the interconnect agreement by giving 30 days notice to Burlington. The 12/31/92 Interconnect Point Operating Agreement Paragraph 6 provides that either party may terminate on 180 prior notice after expiration of the primary term. This is of limited use to us since the primary term does not expire until 12/31/02. However the paragraph also provides that the agreement may be terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days prior written notice in the event the OBA between the parties is terminated. As we've already discussed termination of the agreement is an extreme measure from a customer relations standpoint and we probably need to weigh our other options first. Let me know if you have further questions. [/INST] Category: Company Business, Strategy, etc.(elaborate in Section 3 [Topics])"

We believe however that the residential market opportunity is best pursued through a separate entity outside of Enron Mary Clark@ENRON 04/20/2000 02:31 PM To: Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES Maureen McVicker/HOU/EES@EES cc: Subject: Annual Meeting Q&A Steve we need to include a potential question in the Q&A document that addresses if Enron will get back into the residential business (i.e. Resco).

I wanted to let you know that I am extremely concerned about the Associate/Analyst program so much so that I feel all the work I have done and all the time I have spent on the program has had little impact outside Wharton/Penn recruiting. In fact we won't get more than 1 associate from Wharton this year for a variety of internal and external reasons. This program has brought incredible talent into the organization but we have lost a lot of momentum over the last two years. In as much as I would like to continue to support the program I can't in its current form and don't have time to fix what I thought we had been addressing. The entire program is disfunctional and the commercial teams are not lending support to the program. I'd be very happy to spend a few minutes of your time (rather than blather on in an email) to give you both my overview of the program and suggest changes and improvements. You know you have my support but the current state of affairs down there has gotten me to my rope's end with the program.

Pamela Lesh/ENRON@enronxgate 03/05/2001 04:04 PM To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT Subject: Several matters Hi Steve! Long time no talk. I hope you are well - I KNOW you are busy! I just have a couple of matters for your attention: 1. We as part of a group of Northwest IOUS are exploring the possibility of retaining former Montana Governor Racicot to work BPA issues on our behalf. PGE will continue with Mike Andrews as our lobbyist but Racicot would work for the IOUs as a group. Does this cause you any concerns? Incidentally we may step up our efforts somewhat in the general area of BPA because of the situation out here. Please let me know if I or Mike should be coordinating what we do with any of your folks in DC. 2. One of the major Northwest issues is who will be the next BPA Administrator. For a variety of reasons there really aren't any good candidates from the Northwest and we're probably all to close to the situation anyway. I was wondering if the Enron net could come up with any good ideas for someone with good energy and policy experience from outside the Northwest? Someone who would appeal to the Bush administration? 3. With the delay in closing our sale to Sierra we would very much like the ability to use Enron Online for trading. I believe we can get the regulatory approvals necessary but apparently when we raised this some months ago there was strong opposition from within Enron particularly Joe Hartsoe. Do you see an issue with pursuing this? How do you suggest I move this forward? Thanks Steve. As you may hear from time to time things are going well here in Oregon. We are proceeding on our restructuring which is beginning to get notice from NARUC and others as a possible model for states that have not yet proceeded. It's an interesting world. I look forward to hearing from you. [/INST] Category: Company Business, Strategy, etc.(elaborate in Section 3 [Topics])"

We hope to have agreed on the Q&A's by then and to send it out the announcement on Thursday. John To be sent to: All Enron Europe all employees in Japan all Global Markets and all VPs and up around the company Enron has established several wholesale businesses in Japan in the last year including Metals Power Plant Development (via our investment in EnCom) Coal LNG & Weather. We see significant opportunities in each of these businesses and we will continue to expand our presence in Japan in order to capture these opportunities. However while Japan continues to make progress towards a liberalized electricity market significant barriers to power trading remain under the current interim market structure. Until further tangible steps are taken to improve third party access for electricity in Japan we will suspend our power marketing efforts and focus on the significant opportunities that currently exist in our other wholesale businesses. [Any statement regarding our existing power sales commitment?] Once the necessary regulatory changes have been completed we expect to aggressively pursue Enron's traditional position as the leading buyer and seller of electricity in every deregulated market. We are making a number of organization changes in order to better align our resources with the opportunities in the Japanese market. [deleted text] Joe Hirl our President of Enron Japan will move to the Global Markets group and lead a team that will focus on developing all our Global Markets opportunities in Japan especially Weather Oil LNG Coal and Shipping. We expect to continue our general recruiting of Japanese nationals and as President of Enron Japan Joe will continue to provide the overall business leadership to both recruiting and the Analyst and Associate program in Japan. The Finance origination team headed by Jeremy Thirsk will continue to report to Joe and also move to Global Markets. Our power trading group led by Morton Erik Pettersen will transition into other roles around Enron. The Equity/FX/Interest rate team which is a part of Global Markets has two employees in the Tokyo office today and they expect to expand their efforts throughout the year. The EnCom group which is our power plant development business (with minority partners) and headed by Carey Sloan will continue its efforts in developing power plants in Japan. We are pleased with the progress we are making on a number of sites and EnCom will continue to report to the Enron Europe Office of the Chairman. Our Metals team headed by Kazunari Sugimoto will continue to report through Enron Metals in London. By May we expect Enron Credit to have two to three employees in Tokyo pursing the Credit Derivative business. These employees remain in Enron Credit  a part of Enron Europe. EBS has two employees headed by Jim Weisser and this team expects to expand by year end. The Industrial Markets team also expects to have two employees in the Tokyo office in the next couple of months. In the last seven months the commercial support services for Japan have been transitioned to London for support and this is not changing. Jane McBride heads the legal team and will continue to functionally report to Mark Evans General Counsel in London. The RAC function will continue to report to Ted Murphy head of RAC for Enron Europe. The Risk Management and Accounting team is headed by Jan-Erland Bekeng will continue to functionally report to Fernley Dyson in London. The IT HR Tax and real estate teams will also continue to functionally report to London. Nick O'Day who heads the Public Affairs group (Government & Regulatory Affairs and the Public Relations) in Japan will report to the Enron Europe Office of the Chair with a Public Relations functional reporting to Jackie Gentle in London and a Government Affairs functional reporting to Rick Shapiro in Houston. We anticipate that his team's efforts will be primarily directed to supporting the EnCom power plant development team but they will also continue to provide support for Global Markets EBS & Industrial Markets. We have already made considerable progress in breaking into the Japanese markets across a wide range of Enron businesses and we anticipate that this will provide significant profit growth for years to come. Through these current changes we can demonstrate our ability to be flexible and target our resources where they will realise the most immediate value for the company.

So now in addition to Channel 2 mentioning WetherNet brought to you by Enron everytime they talk about the weather in downtown Houston they will mention the current temp. at the Enron building.

As you know her firm represents the Government of India. She initiated the conversation on India and our issues there saying something to the effect that the firm has told the Indian government how important Enron is and how close Ken is to the White House. They also told the Embassy that the issue would NOT likely come up in the Bush meeting with the PM since the Finance Minister will be in town for World Bank meetings and they assumed it would come up at that level. I said I was not handling the issue. She said the firm would be open to trying to work out the issue or help with same in bringing the two sides together. Also reminded me that Sen. Dole is at the firm. All I said on substance was that certainly India understood the importance of this issue on the foreign investment climate there. FYI.

Here are the main items in a quick bullet format so you have the flavor of them. Delete provision on federal jurisdiction over bundled/unbundled (they don't offer a reason). We of course agree for tactical reasons. Add a provision to authorize FERC to order wheeling in States that open retail markets. Add a provision to allow FERC to issue wheeling orders on its own motion based on an informal hearing rather than an adjudicatory hearing as under current law. Make it clear that the Federal Power Act does not affect the authority of a State to require retail competition (the comments say some utilities have tried to argue that the FPA prohibits states). The provision giving FERC power to order RTO participation should be deleted. The comments raise drafting question. The changes to the FERC merger review sections of the FPA should be limited. FERC lite should be extended only to state municipal utilities and cooperatives not the Federal utilities. The FERC should authority over the Federal transmission systems equivalent to FERC authority over public utilities (with special BPA rules). No need to legislate on market-based rates (we oppose the Bingaman language anyway so this is helpful). Interconnection language should be limited to transmission facilities not local distribution. No objection to streamlined reliability provision (this is good for us). Remedial measures for market power should be deleted. Administration to provide legislative language on federal transmission siting provisions which they want to retain. Not convinced there is a need for market transparency rules because FERC and DOE already have enough authority. Administration supports even tougher criminal penalties. Recordkeeping under PUHCA repeal should be clarified. Federal purchase requirement for renewable energy should be deleted. No objection to real-time pricing standard. Net metering should be limited to small residential renewable facilities. Do not support federal renewable portfolio standard (but could clarify state authority to adopt same).

The school is also happy and wants to strengthen its relationship with Enron. They had earlier this year contacted a Laura Kalmans Director of Community Development at Enron to discuss various ideas for cooperation with Enron that would strengthen our capacity in environmental matters and give the students exposure to real world issues but nothing happened and they lost contact. They asked me who they should contact to find out how to pursue this and I said I thought it might be you or someone under you. They now want to send a letter to someone at Enron on this proposal.

His dissertation research is on the investment behavior of Independent Power Producers in the US. As a result of research assistance he has done for me he knows the California market very well and is familiar with the other ISOs. I think he would be an excellent match for you.

The full Energy and Commerce Committee may take it up as early as next week (probably Thursday May 17th). The Subcommittee DEFEATED an amendment by Rep. Waxman (D-CA) to impose wholesale price caps for 18 months. The amendment was defeated 12-20 with all Republicans voting against including the three from California and Rep. Greg Walden (R-OR) who while seen as the last to decide to oppose the price cap amendment was the most forceful and articulate in opposition to the amendment. Also voting NO were Democratic Reps. Ralph Hall (D-TX) and Chris John (D-TX) with which we had met in recent days. The final vote tracked our whip count going into the meeting. Rep. Albert Wynn (D-MD) offered and withdrew an amendment to delete the negawatts provision. There was bipartisan criticism that while the concept made sense there were potential problems in terms of possible games playing including end users being able to sell power while not actualy reducing their normal power levels. Another member said that electric coops that are required to sell at cost could have customers then go out and resell that power and make a lot of money. Several Members said businesses could shut down put workers out of work and become energy marketers and make more money. Chairman Barton made a forceful defense of negawatts. While the amendment to strike was deleted we will need to respond to these criticisms and shore this up before full committee next week. There will be another attempt to delete at full committee unless these concerns are addressed in an amended version. Ranking Democrat Rick Boucher (D-VA) offered and withdrew an amendment to reinstate FERC maximum prices for the secondary transmission market thus reversing the Feb. 2000 FERC order. This woudl last for 18 months. Chairman Barton said he agreed with Boucher that there is a problem with what appear to be high gas transmission rates to California but he disagrees with the proposed remedy. He pledged to work with Boucher before Full Committee mark-up. We are obtaining a copy of this amendment and should analyze it ASAP for its potential impact on Enron operations. Rep. Ed Markey (D-MA) offered and withdrew an amendment to impose a series of new tests to be administered by FERC all with the goal of discouraging spot market transactions or at least what he would define as excessive use of the spot market and at the same time encourage deep bilateral mechanisms. The mechanisms included a market balance test that would say only sellers with a commitment to the long term market could sell in the spot market at unregulated rates and spot market circuit breakers that would be triggered when reserves are low in a given market. Chairman Barton said he likes the concept of a spot market circuit breaker but felt that the amendment was too complicated to be evaluated today. We will also pursue an analysis of this amendment since it will likely be offered again in some form. Mr. Markey also offered and withdrew a net metering proposal that would establish federal interconnection standards for individual consumers who would want to use fuel cells and other renewable technology to put power onto the system. It was interesting that those who opposed negawatts spoke favorably of net metering even though they are complementary. The subcommittee by voice vote adopted a Walden Amendment to strike the section of the bill that would have required an RTO if 10 of the western governors approved it. The debate was pro-RTO but the rationale for deleting the provision is that one is already being formed and Members from those states did not want to upset the work already under way. A series of other amendments on other matters were offered and withdrawn none of which relate to our activities. [/INST] Category: Company Business, Strategy, etc.(elaborate in Section 3 [Topics])"

Mr. Skilling's office is hesitant to allocate more than two hours without your recommendation. Emerson is being persistent. The key players from Emerson are David Farr newly appointed CEO and James Berges President and effectively the leader of Emerson's strategic development effort. It is anticipated that both would attend the meeting. Emerson execs want to (i) get to know Mr. Skilling and other senior management (ii) discuss mutual business opportunities and (iii) hold a discussion about the transformation of Enron from a pipeline company to its current form. The last point has to do with Emerson's continuing self-transformation effort and how Enron achieved its transformation. I need your advice and recommendation. Please respond by e-mail or telephone (x5-4040). Background: Emerson initiated this latest round of contact with Enron in November 2000 when Mike Train and Mark Proudfoot both Emerson VPs of Corporate Development visited the Enron building hosted by Steve Kean. I met them at that time. Since that initial meeting Emerson has aggressively pursued a business joint venture as preferred supplier with Martin Wenzel and the distributed power business I believe with promising results. My sense is that Emerson is uniquely positioned as EES' partner in that business. I am waiting to receive an update from Martin. Emerson is also interested in becoming a preferred supplier for EES's DSM business. While we generally support that idea we are pressing Emerson to reciprocate by becoming a customer of our bundled outsource business. Emerson is highly decentralized and our efforts to date have been unsuccessful. I want to use the meeting as an opportunity to press Emerson to consider a proposal from EES's bundled outsource business. Please let me know your recommendation on this matter.

NECUPUC supports the request for the release of the unredacted copies of ISO-NE's September 21 2000 Answer in this case. In the alternative they would ask that the Commission provide to the regulators that are parties to the proceeding unredacted copies of the ISO's September 21 2000 Answer subject to an appropriate protective order. Duke Energy North America (DENA) filed an Answer that opposes the MPUC request for public information. DENA argues that only a three month lag in the release of confidential information is impermissible under a prior FERC ruling in the NSTAR Services Co. case which set out a six-month lag rule for the release of information. Their second argument was that the request seeks information for all NEPOOL markets and not just the ICAP market which is subject to the suit. If the FERC authorizes the release of confidential information then it should be subject to a protective order which contains the following: The information may only be used for the purposes of this docket. Only specifically named reviewing Reps associated with the MPUC may review the information. The confidential materials may not be removed from the NE-ISO's premises. The reviewing rep must execute a nondisclosure certificate. Answer to the MPUC's Motion for Disclosure of Information from Northeast Utilities Service Company and Select Energy and request for expedited commission action. NUSCO and Select Energy Support MPUC's request for disclosure of information that the ISO has filed under seal but opposes the selective disclosure of this information to the MPUC and other regulatory commissions and not other participants. NUSCO and Select Energy request expedited action due the financial implications and there is also considerable uncertainty regarding prices in the residual ICAP market in January February and March of 2000 due to the suspended settlement pending Commission guidance.

OR we might want to think about formalizing this say once a quarter and sending out invitations and maybe charging for this????I think there are pros and cons on all sides of the charging issue.....maybe we should get together and discuss?

This is not the most clearly drafted provision as it was the subject of much negotiation....and was significantly narrowed from the original scope proposed by AEP. Thus please consult with me prior to entering into any solicitation agreement or arrangement which might arguably be covered by our limited covenant not to compete on the supply side for 3 months. There are many aspects of the post-close transition which will require cooperation between Enron and AEP/HPL and thus it behoves us to carefully weigh the risks and rewards of stepping too close to or over the line. Furtheralthough a technical reading of the non-competition agreement only applies to ENA no ENA UPSTREAM deals which would violate this covenant if there were to be done as ENA should be done without clearance from Brian Redmond and me. Please communicate this restriction to those who report to you and have need to be aware of this limited restriction.

Sorry to re-write so much -- but I believe this is consistent with Steve's conversation with Ken and with the media interviews he has given to date as well as our advocacy on multipollutant and climate change. Jeff Jeffrey Keeler Director Environmental Strategies Enron Washington DC office - (202) 466-9157 Cell Phone (203) 464-1541 Rob Bradley 03/23/2001 10:14 AM To: Jeffrey Keeler/Corp/Enron cc: Michael Terraso/OTS/Enron@ENRON Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron Lauren Iannarone/NY/ECT@ECT Ann M Schmidt/Corp/Enron@ENRON Subject: Ken Lay Statement to Employees on Bush CO2 Policy (KEELER EDITS) Here is my draft for Ken in response to Ann's eBiz request. Comments welcome The President after a good deal of study and soul searching decided not to support mandatory controls on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from power plants as part of a multipollutant clean air strategy. His decision was based on some very important factors -- the nation's energy markets are experiencing unprecedented supply and price challenges that any CO2 mandate could exacerbate and U.S. regulation of CO2 in the near-term could be ill-advised because the Kyoto protocol on global treatment of greenhouse gas emissions is unworkable in its current form. I was somewhat concerned that the message sent by the Bush administration would polarize the debate over how the U.S. should treat CO2 emissions in the long term as his statement did provoke a very negative anti-environment reaction by many concerned individuals and organizations. Because this is an important issue to all parties on all sides of the debate I believe that the administration should convene an ongoing process to carefully examine global climate change and all the long-term economic scientific and social impacts of action regulate CO2 emissions. The President's position on CO2 notwithstanding Enron continue to be a private sector leader in offering real solutions towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions in a rapidly expanding energy market. We are well-positioned through our experience with low-carbon fuels for electric generation (natural gas and wind in particular) our focus on new power generation and tecnologies our leadership position in promoting efficiency through Enron Energy Services' energy outsourcing business and our expertise in emissions trading and risk management. A multipollutant appraoch to reducing power plant emissions makes a lot of sense from and environmental and energy policy standpoint. Enron will continue to work with the Bush administration and Congress toward structuring a program that can achieve environmental goals while providing incentives to build cleaner more efficient generation promoting a broad mix of fuels and tecnologies and giving industry the flexibility and economic incentives to make reductions in a market-based cost-effective way. If we're able to make meaningful reductions in 3 pollutants -- NOx SO2 and mercury -- and we do it in a way that promotes efficiency and new technology we'll make progress on CO2 whether it is regulated or not. In the meantime I will remain active in the global climate change debate to position Enron as a constructive player in the public policy arena and as an industry leader in promoting market-driven solutions to the world's energy and environmental problems.

The four witnesses were Jerry Halvorsen of INGAA William Nugent of Maine for NARUC David Cook general counsel of NERC and Stan Szwed vp-transmission of FirstEnergy Corp. The hearing was well attended by committee Republicans but only Sen. Bingaman and Sen. Landrieu on the Democratic side and then only briefly. Highlights NARUC's Nugent urged the Committee to move swiftly to confirm Wood and Brownell to FERC noting their confirmation hearing is tomorrow. Consensus that energy infrastructure is not able to keep up with projected energy demand both gas and electric. Surprising willingness (even among western Republican senators who are normally pro-states rights pro-private property rights) that Congress should at least seriously consider if not implement some form of federal authority over power transmission siting. Specifics were not nailed down with some senators expressing more support for treating electric like FERC already has power over natural gas while others were inclined more toward a FERC back stop or last resort authority when state decisionmaking breaks down. The drift was certainly toward some enhanced federal role. NERC released is Summer Assessment today that is more pessimistic than California ISO on the extent of expected rolling blackouts and shortages this summer. NERC seees a capacity shortage in the Pacific Northwest this winter. While NY/NE is adequate this summer Cook says it bears watching because of bouts of high heat in the region and a high level of unplanned outages that often occur in the region in the summer. Chairman Murkowski engaged in a series of questions with INGAA's Halvorsen designed to lay the blame for the natural gas capacity problem to California and corresponding high price levels on the actions of LDCs in California not supporting expansion of interstate pipelines. Halvorsen's testimony includes a chart of specific cases where LDCs intervened. In his verbal testimony Halvorsen singled out Sempra as a source of opposition including Sempra filings against expansions by Transwestern and Kern River. Chairman Murkowski got Halvorsen to say that the actions of the California LDCs and the intrastate nature of all gas pipelines in California effectively denied California consumers the benefit of open access for natural gas. Murkowski implied he would entertain a change in the Natural Gas Act as it relates to the status of interstate pipelines going in to California. Sen. Domenici joined the increasing chorus of members of Congress raising questions about why natural gas prices are low at the wellhead for his producers in New Mexico but so high into California. He asked the panel who is making the money in the differential but none of the witnesses wanted to tackle the question. This is just one more indication of the growing interest in the natural gas aspects of the California situation. [/INST] Category: Company Business, Strategy, etc.(elaborate in Section 3 [Topics])"

I understand that Peter Goebel was quite clear with HP in today's meetings regarding the imminent nature of his wireless decision the breadth of vendors with whom he could conceivably do business and the fact that the wireless deal and the Enron sell side are inextricably linked. Sarah-Joy mentioned that Gerry has not been present in the more recent conversations which we're taking to indicate that Bill and Greg understand that his focus was different than ours.

Additionally I outlined the discussion points/action items from this morning's meeting you held with Jennifer Medcalf and myself. Per your request the HP presentation complete with a listing of HP's business partners was e-mailed to you this morning. HP contacts to date: Bill Lovejoy Western Gulf Area Sales Manager Houston TX #(713)-439-5587 (Gerry Cashiola's boss) Gerry Cashiola sales representative Houston TX #(713)-439-5555 (To date HP person coordinating the relationship--seeking a short term play) Greg Pyle Solution Control Manager Southeast Region Austin TX (#(512)-257-5735 (Pyle has been playing the business developer role but continues to defer leadership of the process to Gerry Cashiola) Daniel Morgridge Manager of Internet - E-Services long term alliances Austin TX #(512)-257-5736 (Interested in E-services/wireless longer term alliances) Bill Dwyer Chief Architect e-Services Solutions Cupertino CA #(408)-447-5240 (To date clearly the most knowledgeable person on HP's business propositions strong technical financial background to craft value propositions. Gerry Cashiola and Greg Pyle deferred to his judgement in the 11/16th meeting) Matt On November 10th GSS Business Development took HP through a tour of Enron's trading floor the gas control center and the peaking power plant unit center on the trading floor. This tour was one meeting amongst several held in October and November to provide HP a full overview of Enron's products and services and introduce them to appropriate contacts at Enron (EBS GSS buy side -- Peter Goebel). On November 16th GSS Business Development Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark outlined 3 possible EBS/HP focus areas -- connectivity storage and wireless. Three EBS action items were defined in that meeting: 1) HP was to provide an HP contact on connectivity (to date Gerry Cashiola has stalled on providing this). Sarah-Joy will continue to pursue this information and get a sense from Gerry Cashiola of what he means by short term opportunity. What is HP's time horizon for short term? 2) EBS and GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call on Storage with Ravi to explore size and potential scope of opportunity (completed 12/8) 3) GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call with Peter Goebel GSS IT Sourcing Portfolio Leader (set for 12/14) In conversations with you Jennifer Medcalf and myself this morning several decisions on forward-looking strategy with HP/EBS were confirmed: Gerry Cashiola has been unable to take control of the process. More importantly despite numerous visits to Enron in which he has had overviews of Enron's products and services met with Peter Goebel and his team on the GSS buy side and participated in an Experience Enron tour Gerry has been unable to define an HP business proposition. The coordination between Cashiola (short term initiative) Morgridge (long term 12-24 months) has remained unorganized. These initiatives need to be developed separately. Clearly the conversations with HP need to be elevated to a more senior level so EBS can work with HP decision makers who can move the relationship forward at a strategic level. As the relationship is developed at this strategic level shorter term opportunities will crop up along the way. But Gerry's short term plans will not be the focus of the EBS/HP relationship rather a by-product. To facilitate this process of elevating the relationship Jennifer Medcalf and I are following up with Bill Lovejoy and Greg Pyle. Lovejoy's boss is Dan Sytsma VP of HP's America's Central Region. In the conference call Thursday 12/14 with Peter Goebel and HP regarding wireless initiatives Peter will support the GSS/BD push for the HP/EBS initiative by reiterating the following two points: a) Enron is already an HP customer the onus is on HP to move forward on the process of building a strategic relationship (IBM and Lexmark are only some of the HP competitors who could push them out of the running) b) HP's ability to bring the right people to the table will influence HP's business relationship process with Enron Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark could build their relationship with Bill Dwyer Chief Architect e-Services Solutions (met at the meeting 11/16) in the near term. Perhaps plan a visit to Cupertino California to see Dwyer in person. We look forward to continuing close collaboration with your team on this and other opportunities.

Terence H Thorn@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 10/03/2000 08:30 AM To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: AGA Steve I need your help. Twice in the last three months I have run into the Chairman of AGA who has taken my head off for Enron not renewing its AGA dues. I understand that the dues had been paid by Stan Horton who had decided that the pipeline group with INGAA representing it had no need for and received no benefit from the membership. I guess a few years back when AGA kicked the pipelines out they renegotiated the dues into some type of sub membership for around 85K. AGA approached the gas marketing team and talked to Mike Roberts about renewing the membership and maintaining relations with his customers and later to Jeff Shankman who passed them off to some other person and never got back to them as promised. This is a heads up to tell you that Bob Catell of Brooklyn Union fame- one of Enron's oldest customers and friends will be calling Lay. It seems to me that pro rating the dues among ENA and EGM and maybe GPG might be a solution. Anyhow I promised to pass on the complaint. Thanks.

In this case FERC stated that a trial-type hearing is not necessary . . . . and specifically rejected the use of a trial-type evidentiary hearing. Slip op. at 47-48 & n.97. Thus while I have not researched the matter as yet my preliminary view is that the CPUC's attempt to invoke FERC's discovery processes would appear to be outside the contemplation of FERC's Nov. 1 order and its regulations unless FERC specifically orders discovery in this case. (The CPUC seems to recognize the relevance of this consideration when it specifically attempts to equate paper hearings with trial-type hearings see page 1 of its Motion.) The CPUC's motion may prompt FERC to decide whether or not to allow discovery in this case under Rule 401. While the CPUC's motion does not apply directly to marketers FERC's ruling will be precedent in the event the CPUC or someone else hereafter serves discovery on other parties. As a result we need to consider whether laying in the weeds risks losing an opportunity to present our views on whether FERC should allow discovery in a paper hearing with an expedited decisional track particularly in light of the fact that Staff has already conducted. >>> Jeffrey Watkiss 11/08/00 10:31AM >>> Does anyone have an idea as to why marketers including EPMI are not included in the list of subject companies: Exh. B? Since EPMI is not a subject of the motion why should it answer? Lying in the weeds may be a more prudent course of action. >>> Fergus Gary S. <GFergus@brobeck.com> 11/07/00 10:08PM >>> I just spoke with Mary to make sure we have the same information. Here are the facts we have so far. On November 4th the CPUC filed a motion with FERC to adopt the form of protective order that the CPUC entered to compel the production of documents and to shorten time to answer. According to Exhibit B (read to me by Nancy Pickover at Bracewell) the following CPUC moved against the following entities: AES Williams Duke Dynegy Reliant and Southern. Enron entities were NOT named in exhibit B. This is not to say that we could not be easily added to the group. While the motion reads as if the CPUC was moving against everybody in fact in footnote 2 they state they are only moving against the entities named in Exhibit B. We will have Exhibit B in hand first thing tomorrow via FEDEX to confirm this. To repeat Enron is not named yet.

The second paragraph and the first few bullets after it should be rewritten as follows to make it clear that the current legislative proposal on RTOs is far off the mark as opposed to being fixed by technical corrections as the draft letter now states: You have identified RTOs as critical to the development of a well-functioning transmission system and we wholeheartedly agree. We commend you for including all transmission-owning utilities in the RTO provisions and for requiring that transmission be conducted on an open-access basis. However to accomplish the RTO and transmission goals we share it is essential that any legislation on RTOs not slow down the process already underway at FERC. Unfortunately the discussion draft as issued on October 9th does not meet this test. Specifically the proposal Establishes a lengthy and cumbersome process that will delay the formation of RTOs by imposing procedural requirements that advantage those who oppose properly functioning RTOs including evidentiary hearings and court appeals review under standards of judicial review not normally applicable to Federal Power Act cases. Removes the ability of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to deal with an evolving marketplace by statutorily freezing market and operational structures in place as of date of enactment regardless of changed circumstances. [rest of the bullets as in the draft letter] We appreciate the opportunity to offer these suggestions to strengthen the draft letter. Please call with any questions or comments before the Legislative Affairs Committee meeting tomorrow. Thanks. John [/INST] Category: Document editing/checking(collaboration)"

We will be crucified by the public media consumer groups legislators governor attorney general etc. and this action will reaffirm our reputation of packing up and leaving when it's not in our interest. The impact of this action would be exacerbated since it is on the heels of UC/CSU. I would also argue that this hurts our national dereg efforts. If we're advocating that competition and choice benefits consumers and then we turn around and pull out of a market and abandon customers when we're not profiting we'll kill any chances we have of ever serving retail customers in California -- or in any other state. We look foolish advocating for direct access when we're not willing to serve our existing -- let alone future customers What about a preemptive strike that engages these 16000 customers to weigh in on direct access -- i.e. a letter that says Enron may be forced to cancel its contract -- call/write/send the enclosed postcard to your legislator and tell them you want to keep your right to choose your energy service provider. Our credibility is on the line. Before we take this action we need to be cognizant of all the long-range strategic implications and we need to seriously weigh the negative impact this will have on our corporate reputation on our legislative abilities and on our commercial success going forward. kd James D Steffes 04/12/2001 09:05 PM To: Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT Sandra McCubbin/NA/Enron@Enron Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron Janel Guerrero/Corp/Enron@Enron Mark Palmer/Corp/Enron@ENRON Karen Denne/Corp/Enron@ENRON Susan J Mara/NA/Enron Peggy Mahoney/HOU/EES@EES Harry Kingerski/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Dan Leff/HOU/EES@EES Subject: CONFIDENTIAL - Residential in CA In the meeting today no decision was made about what to do with Enron's 16000 residential customers. Each of the contracts gives a basic 30 day out right to Enron. That being said I think that we have a short window to push for DA before any public action impacts us in Sacramento. I realize that the ultimate action (which I think is inevitable) makes it harder for our advocacy on DA but real $ are flowing out of the company. EES will give us notice when a decision is reached.

We currently have Ken scheduled to participate in an energy roundtable discussion on the afternoon of the 2nd with at least four governors attending that session--Kempthorne Hull Geringer and Ridge. (Engler and Rowland are also attending the overall event but they will be in a healthcare breakout session). Kaufman and I thought that it would be particularly helpful for Arizona Gov Hull and Idaho Gov Kempthorne to hear Ken's remarks and have a chance to talk with him. I have also been working with Rosalee to schedule an early evening (6:00-7:00pm) meeting that night with Exelon co CEO John Rowe. John Rowe will be in California for some investor meetings and well as attending some sections of the RGA events. I have told my counterpart at Rowe's office that we would confirm Ken's availability on Monday morning. If you do decide that Ken should attend the Davis meeting in Sacremento that day instead we will just reconfigure a bit. Paul and I will cover the RGA events and I will cancel the John Rowe get together. I would also want to talk about having Mr. Lay reach out to Hull and Kempthorne via phone sometime in the near future. Same with Rowe.

She said the Governor wanted to invite Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling to a meeting the Governor is having at 2:00 p.m. in Sacramento on May 2 with a lot of CEOs. I still pressed for a one on one meeting on May 3 in Sacramento but she told me the Governor wanted to have the one meeting all at once and his schedule was very tight on Thursday May 3. I transferred her to Sherri and called Ken. Ken wanted me to try to get more specific information which she shared that it is with generators - Sempra Williams CalPine Duke Dynegy and Reliant. She also said since the Governor has worked with Ken she thought he might prefer that he attend. Ken said to let you all know and be thinking whether we even want to do it. He said one thought might be that he'd do that meeting and maybe Jeff could do the one in L.A. on May 2. Talk to you Monday.

NECUPUC supports the request for the release of the unredacted copies of ISO-NE's September 21 2000 Answer in this case. In the alternative they would ask that the Commission provide to the regulators that are parties to the proceeding unredacted copies of the ISO's September 21 2000 Answer subject to an appropriate protective order. Duke Energy North America (DENA) filed an Answer that opposes the MPUC request for public information. DENA argues that only a three month lag in the release of confidential information is impermissible under a prior FERC ruling in the NSTAR Services Co. case which set out a six-month lag rule for the release of information. Their second argument was that the request seeks information for all NEPOOL markets and not just the ICAP market which is subject to the suit. If the FERC authorizes the release of confidential information then it should be subject to a protective order which contains the following: The information may only be used for the purposes of this docket. Only specifically named reviewing Reps associated with the MPUC may review the information. The confidential materials may not be removed from the NE-ISO's premises. The reviewing rep must execute a nondisclosure certificate. Answer to the MPUC's Motion for Disclosure of Information from Northeast Utilities Service Company and Select Energy and request for expedited commission action. NUSCO and Select Energy Support MPUC's request for disclosure of information that the ISO has filed under seal but opposes the selective disclosure of this information to the MPUC and other regulatory commissions and not other participants. NUSCO and Select Energy request expedited action due the financial implications and there is also considerable uncertainty regarding prices in the residual ICAP market in January February and March of 2000 due to the suspended settlement pending Commission guidance.

Additionally I outlined the discussion points/action items from this morning's meeting you held with Jennifer Medcalf and myself. Per your request the HP presentation complete with a listing of HP's business partners was e-mailed to you this morning. HP contacts to date: Bill Lovejoy Western Gulf Area Sales Manager Houston TX #(713)-439-5587 (Gerry Cashiola's boss) Gerry Cashiola sales representative Houston TX #(713)-439-5555 (To date HP person coordinating the relationship--seeking a short term play) Greg Pyle Solution Control Manager Southeast Region Austin TX (#(512)-257-5735 (Pyle has been playing the business developer role but continues to defer leadership of the process to Gerry Cashiola) Daniel Morgridge Manager of Internet - E-Services long term alliances Austin TX #(512)-257-5736 (Interested in E-services/wireless longer term alliances) Bill Dwyer Chief Architect e-Services Solutions Cupertino CA #(408)-447-5240 (To date clearly the most knowledgeable person on HP's business propositions strong technical financial background to craft value propositions. Gerry Cashiola and Greg Pyle deferred to his judgement in the 11/16th meeting) Matt On November 10th GSS Business Development took HP through a tour of Enron's trading floor the gas control center and the peaking power plant unit center on the trading floor. This tour was one meeting amongst several held in October and November to provide HP a full overview of Enron's products and services and introduce them to appropriate contacts at Enron (EBS GSS buy side -- Peter Goebel). On November 16th GSS Business Development Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark outlined 3 possible EBS/HP focus areas -- connectivity storage and wireless. Three EBS action items were defined in that meeting: 1) HP was to provide an HP contact on connectivity (to date Gerry Cashiola has stalled on providing this). Sarah-Joy will continue to pursue this information and get a sense from Gerry Cashiola of what he means by short term opportunity. What is HP's time horizon for short term? 2) EBS and GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call on Storage with Ravi to explore size and potential scope of opportunity (completed 12/8) 3) GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call with Peter Goebel GSS IT Sourcing Portfolio Leader (set for 12/14) In conversations with you Jennifer Medcalf and myself this morning several decisions on forward-looking strategy with HP/EBS were confirmed: Gerry Cashiola has been unable to take control of the process. More importantly despite numerous visits to Enron in which he has had overviews of Enron's products and services met with Peter Goebel and his team on the GSS buy side and participated in an Experience Enron tour Gerry has been unable to define an HP business proposition. The coordination between Cashiola (short term initiative) Morgridge (long term 12-24 months) has remained unorganized. These initiatives need to be developed separately. Clearly the conversations with HP need to be elevated to a more senior level so EBS can work with HP decision makers who can move the relationship forward at a strategic level. As the relationship is developed at this strategic level shorter term opportunities will crop up along the way. But Gerry's short term plans will not be the focus of the EBS/HP relationship rather a by-product. To facilitate this process of elevating the relationship Jennifer Medcalf and I are following up with Bill Lovejoy and Greg Pyle. Lovejoy's boss is Dan Sytsma VP of HP's America's Central Region. In the conference call Thursday 12/14 with Peter Goebel and HP regarding wireless initiatives Peter will support the GSS/BD push for the HP/EBS initiative by reiterating the following two points: a) Enron is already an HP customer the onus is on HP to move forward on the process of building a strategic relationship (IBM and Lexmark are only some of the HP competitors who could push them out of the running) b) HP's ability to bring the right people to the table will influence HP's business relationship process with Enron Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark could build their relationship with Bill Dwyer Chief Architect e-Services Solutions (met at the meeting 11/16) in the near term. Perhaps plan a visit to Cupertino California to see Dwyer in person. We look forward to continuing close collaboration with your team on this and other opportunities.

J= effords has never mattered much to Californians. Until now. The Verm= ont senator's widely anticipated decision to abandon his fellow Republican= s and put Democrats in control of the Senate could have big implications f= or California particularly on energy and environmental policy lawmakers = and lobbyists said Wednesday. The change which Jeffords is expected= to announce today could increase political pressure on the Bush adminis= tration to respond more aggressively to California's electricity crisis t= hese insiders said. And it might force the White House to compromise= on key elements of the national energy policy it unveiled last week. In f= act the administration's proposed budget cuts for programs to promote ren= ewable energy were said to be a factor in Jeffords' decision. At th= e very least Senate observers said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) is l= ikely to get the floor vote she has sought on price controls for wholesale= electricity. That doesn't necessarily mean that the administration'= s critics will be able to have everything their way. Even if the Senate ap= proves electricity price caps for example the measure would face stiff o= pposition in the GOP-dominated House--and a likely veto if it made it to t= he president's desk. Still a Democratic majority in the Senate wou= ld give Feinstein and other party members a platform to turn up the politi= cal heat on the administration and congressional Republicans on energy pol= icy. It kicks up the dust groaned one energy industry lobbyist wh= o requested anonymity. Observed Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.): If P= resident Bush's hard-edged conservative approach has in fact caused the ba= lance to shift towards Democrats in the Senate it will have profound impl= ications not just for California but for the environment and our nation's= energy policy. Environmentalists seemed almost giddy as they cont= emplated the possible impact of Jeffords' decision on the policies they ca= re about. All of a sudden they said it seems less likely that oil = exploration will take place in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge that r= ecreational snowmobiles will have free access to Yellowstone National Park=  or that the administration's desire to promote nuclear power will be emb= raced by Congress. On the other hand it seems more probable that C= ongress would approve a new plan for managing a vast swath of the Sierra N= evada to protect the region's oldest trees consider legislation to restri= ct emissions of carbon dioxide from power plants and protect California fr= om a resurgence of offshore oil drilling. It's stunning how broad t= he repercussions are particularly on the environment said Gregory Wetst= one of the Natural Resources Defense Council. We're trying not to count o= ur chickens before they hatch. But it will be easier for us in our battles= at least to keep from moving backwards. For instance Jeffords is= a chief advocate of a bill that would regulate carbon dioxide from power = plants. And if events play out as expected he'll become the new chairman = of the Senate committee with jurisdiction over the issue. Another i= ssue under his purview would be the two-decade dispute over a proposed rep= ository for the nation's spent nuclear fuel at Yucca Mountain in Nevada. = Yucca Mountain is a dead turkey declared Michael Francis of the W= ilderness Society. Environmentalists had been worried that a number= of pro-development provisions would be packed into appropriation bills. B= ut with Democratic senators in charge that would become less of a threat= they said. Every wacko idea Republicans have will get a higher lev= el of scrutiny Francis said. The biggest change would be the power= of Senate Democrats to decide which bills will be considered in committee= s and which ones will make it to the floor of the Senate for votes. = As part of a new Democratic majority Feinstein and fellow California De= mocrat Barbara Boxer are likely to gain leverage with the administration o= n a number of issues considered important to the state. That transl= ates into more federal assistance for California across the board predic= ted Steve Maviglio spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis. I think it mean= s more attention to our state for sure Boxer said. Right now the pres= ident doesn't seem to give a darn. They're all looking at California as a = Democratic state. They're not interested. Feinstein who has been = unable to arrange a meeting with Bush to discuss the energy crisis may ge= t better treatment if winning Democratic support becomes more important to= the administration. She has been regarded as a bridge-builder who worked = effectively with Republicans in the past. This has not been a warm = and friendly administration she complained Wednesday. They've got peopl= e who know all the answers and don't want to listen. The White Hou= se disputed that. In fact Bush agreed Wednesday to meet with Davis during= the president's first visit to California next week. Under a Democ= ratic majority Feinstein would be in line to chair two subcommittees: the= military construction panel of the Senate Appropriations Committee and t= he technology terrorism and government information subcommittee of the Se= nate Judiciary Committee. Boxer would be in line to chair the subco= mmittee on Superfund waste control and risk assessment and the Foreign R= elations subcommittee on international operations and terrorism. Mav= iglio predicted that the effects of Jeffords' expected party defection wou= ld be felt immediately. The chairmanship of the Senate Energy and N= atural Resources Committee would be taken away from Frank H. Murkowski (R-= Alaska) who has been openly hostile to California's plight and handed = to Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.) who supports Davis' request for electricity pri= ce controls according to Maviglio. Democrats have assailed Bush's e= nergy plan for tilting heavily toward the supply side. With Democrats in c= harge of the Senate the administration would be more likely to compromise=  perhaps beefing up funding for Democrat-supported causes such as increas= ed energy assistance to low-income households and more aggressive promotio= n of conservation and renewable energy sources such as wind and solar powe= r.

I am faxing to you a bootleg copy of the draft talking points Ed received this morning at the White House energy messaging meeting. These are very close hold. Ed asked that we not circulate these to anyone. Ed asked us to give him feedback of any concerns we have with the talking points (he will be giving them comments). After glancing at the TPs the obvious missing point is open access. However I am not sure we should be alarmed about that. There really isn't any policy in the TPs. This is a typical WH message document. Let me know if you think it is imperative to insert open access. Also Ed would like to position us as the coalition leader of the White House outreach effort. Any thoughts? 2. I am faxing to you EPSA's summary of the generators meeting with Secretary Abraham. I am glad I did not attend this meeting. As you will see from the summary there were three parts to the meeting: a) an exchange of policy views both long and short term b) discussion of how to maximize generator output in Calif and c) a request that industry participate in a DOE reliability group. I don't see any follow up for Enron outside of our normal course of activities and independent interchange with DOE officials. Let me know if you have additional thoughts.

As I understand from my review of certain documents received from SCE in response to our data requests review of an Executive Summary prepared by George Phillips on the issue and from my conversation with him yesterday EES and EEMC as a result of some problems with their settlement system did indeed underreport customers' usage to the ISO during the time period claimed by SCE. This has I believe resulted in two separate (although interrelated) points of contention with SCE -- of which only one is the subject matter of its counterclaim. First the underreporting resulted in Unaccounted For Energy (UFE) charges to the market. In correspondence sent by SCE to EEMC and EES during the last quarter of 2001 it appears that SCE was calculating the cost to the market from the EES/EEMC underreporting by applying the hourly day ahead market clearing price to the individual hourly variances. This cost to the market is overestimated however as SCE failed to take into account the fact that the ISO nets underreported amounts against overreported accounts to get a net amount of underreporting. This underreported amount is then allocated to all providers of physical load within a service territory through the assessment of UFE charges. Thus whatever the ultimate cost was determined to be SCE would not be allocated the entire amount. Second the underreporting of usage to the ISO results according to SCE in SCE paying EES and EEMC a PX credit for energy they never purchased. This claim is separate and apart from what SCE claims EES/EEMC cost the market in the way of UFE charges. What SCE is saying is that it believes that EES and EEMC only purchased on behalf of their customers the amount of energy which they reported to the ISO. EES' and EEMC's customers actually used more than the amount which EES and EEMC reported. SCE calculated the PX credit based on the amount used not reported. It is SCE's claim that EES and EEMC are not entitled to a PX credit on the delta as the market not EES and EEMC purchased those volumes. It is only the second point of contention which is the subject matter of SCE's counterclaim. SCE is alleging that it should not have to pay a PX credit to EES and EEMC for volumes that EES and EEMC did not purchase. SCE is claiming that we only purchased the amount we reported to the ISO. While SCE may believe that it should not have to pay any UFE charges as the result of EES/EEMC underreporting the UFE charges are not the basis of its counterclaim. Based on the above analysis I think that the most critical piece of information to refute the counterclaim is that despite the underreporting of volumes to the ISO EES and EEMC actually purchased on behalf of their DA customers those customers' full usage. Can we make such claim? and do we have data to back it up? Jeanne Bennett [/INST] Category: Company Business, Strategy, etc.(elaborate in Section 3 [Topics])"

From today's Post. Davis seems to continue to put distance between himself and the contracts. Best Jeff Financial California Changes Stance on Refunds Two Sides Far Apart In Energy Talks Peter Behr ? 07/06/2001 The Washington Post FINAL Page E01 Copyright 2001 The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity  saying they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43 billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year. Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term contracts whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for Davis. We've made suggestions we've offered various ways in which people could get us $8.9 billion Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday. You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you want to do it it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion. The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr. according to sources close to the negotiations. Yesterday Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach a compromise. What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood Wagner told reporters. In the event we're unable to do that [Friday] at some point I may offer a preliminary assessment. The settlement conference is set to conclude on Monday. Wagner FERC's chief administrative judge has been trying to push both sides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy. Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California 's largest utility drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on. Last Friday Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative Michael Kahn chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in refunds from power generators and marketers was too high sources said. Wagner's settlement conference which has involved more than 100 lawyers for all sides is closed to the public and media. Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a joke that the parties might as well wear clown suits according to a Dow Jones report confirmed by sources close to the talks. But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers led by Reliant Energy Inc. Williams Energy Services Duke Energy and Southern Co. for failing to make serious settlement offers these sources said. The suppliers have offered to refund $600 million provided the state is able to call off various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds sources said. Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds but now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California 's electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher refund figure some energy analysts believe. Davis's tactical change offering to make the long-term contracts part of an overall settlement comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have to pay for energy under those deals. California 's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed deregulation plan which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at volatile spot market prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer so did the state's electricity bills. In response Davis's aide S. David Freeman and his staff began negotiating long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years. That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was paying at the beginning of this year but above current power prices -- and considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade energy analysts say. A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count as a refund because the deals were reached under commercial duress according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations. Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify. There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be said Michael Zenger California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a just and reasonable standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure. It's not rocket science but it does require the regulators to regulate said Frank Wolak a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight committee for the California grid. Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room billions of dollars apart as the talks approached their final weekend sources said.

April 27 2001 Plan on California Energy Has No Shortage of Critics By JOSEPH KAHN WASHINGTON April 26 * A novel plan by federal regulators to control California's runaway electricity prices is a messy politically motivated compromise that may offer some relief to consumers but will do little to fix the state's dysfunctional energy market analysts said today. The intervention announced by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Wednesday night after much haggling was dismissed by a wide range of critics today as a flawed effort that satisfies no one. It fell short of the sweeping suspension of regional electricity deregulation that California officials and some energy experts had advocated. But it also crossed what has become a firm ideological line among Republican leaders including President Bush by imposing price controls on some electricity sales to utilities. Under the agency's order which takes effect on May 1 California regulators can begin to impose price controls on power generators when electricity supplies fall to within 7.5 percent of consumer demand. The state is expected to face such shortages routinely this summer and the order has the potential to shave billions of dollars off California's electricity bill if implemented fully some people at the federal agency say. The president has a long-held belief that price caps don't work the White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said today. The last thing you want to do is create artificially increased demand and put in disincentives that harm the availability of supply. Mr. Fleischer noted that the energy commission is an independent federal agency adding that the Bush administration has no authority to countermand its orders. But Mr. Bush did appoint the commission's chairman Curtis L. Hbert Jr. a Republican. Like the president Mr. Hbert has often insisted that price caps do no good. But he came under withering political pressure to abandon the agency's largely hands- off approach to the California crisis. Some of that pressure came from the two other commissioners at the agency both Democrats and Mr. Hbert wound up voting for the controls adopted on Wednesday night. The split with the Bush administration raises fresh questions about whether the president will seek to replace Mr. Hbert as chairman in coming weeks. Mr. Bush has nominated two Republicans to fill vacant slots on the commission including Pat Wood a longtime ally of the president who served as chief electricity regulator in Texas. Industry executives say they expect that Mr. Bush will eventually name Mr. Wood to the commission's top post. In a reflection of how delicate the issue is Mr. Hbert argued that the agency's action did not amount to imposing price caps. But his position appeared to rest on a semantic distinction between returning to cost- based electricity regulation (as some Californians favor) and the agency's decision to impose tactical price controls. Among California officials the dominant reaction was disappointment. Some state regulators and market experts said the agency was practicing upside-down economics: it has chosen to impose price limits during periods of severe scarcity when prices theoretically ought to rise to encourage companies to build power plants and encourage people to use less electricity. The agency its critics argue has chosen to ignore price abuses during times of relative abundance when power generators the critics say have used artificial market power to earn high profits. They got it exactly wrong said Frank Wolak chief market supervisor for the California Independent System Operator which runs the state's power grid. It looks like they're doing something but it doesn't work in real time. Mr. Wolak has estimated that most overcharges by generators last year * in amounts that he puts in the billions of dollars * occurred when electricity supplies were not acutely short meaning that the agency's price caps would have had no mitigating effect. The state is likely to face many emergency shortages this summer. But Mr. Wolak said generating companies have become adept at gaming the system. He predicted that they would find ways to continue to earn high profits in California. One fear is that generating companies will arrange to sell their output to affiliates out of state. When California's transmission grid managers scramble to find supplies the same companies will offer to sell the power back to the state but only above the cap price. The agency's new order includes a provision that is intended to discourage this sort of abuse known as megawatt laundering. But the agency has a weak record of enforcing such mandates and California officials are skeptical. The order also came under fire on other grounds. The commission said that price caps would be canceled unless California submitted a proposal to link its transmission grid to the one that serves the Western region a priority of the agency that state officials have resisted. Linda Stuntz an electricity industry lobbyist who is an expert on the agency called that clause bizarre arguing that it held the entire California market hostage to a technical filing requirement. California politicians said they worried that even if the price caps were carried out as promised relief would be too limited. The price limits will be based on estimates of the highest operating costs of the least efficient generating plant in the state. The order as written means that companies that operate efficient generating plants could still sell power at large mark-ups during periods when caps are imposed. When the agency scrutinized the California market earlier this year it found the high-cost generators to be justified in charging about $300 a megawatt hour for electricity a price that is about 10 times as high as the state was paying for power a year ago.

I strongly believe that the public hit we will take will be far greater than our actual out-of-pocket losses. We will be crucified by the public media consumer groups legislators governor attorney general etc. and this action will reaffirm our reputation of packing up and leaving when it's not in our interest. The impact of this action would be exacerbated since it is on the heels of UC/CSU. I would also argue that this hurts our national dereg efforts. If we're advocating that competition and choice benefits consumers and then we turn around and pull out of a market and abandon customers when we're not profiting we'll kill any chances we have of ever serving retail customers in California -- or in any other state. We look foolish advocating for direct access when we're not willing to serve our existing -- let alone future customers What about a preemptive strike that engages these 16000 customers to weigh in on direct access -- i.e. a letter that says Enron may be forced to cancel its contract -- call/write/send the enclosed postcard to your legislator and tell them you want to keep your right to choose your energy service provider. Our credibility is on the line. Before we take this action we need to be cognizant of all the long-range strategic implications and we need to seriously weigh the negative impact this will have on our corporate reputation on our legislative abilities and on our commercial success going forward. kd James D Steffes 04/12/2001 09:05 PM To: Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT Sandra McCubbin/NA/Enron@Enron Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron Janel Guerrero/Corp/Enron@Enron Mark Palmer/Corp/Enron@ENRON Karen Denne/Corp/Enron@ENRON Susan J Mara/NA/Enron Peggy Mahoney/HOU/EES@EES Harry Kingerski/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Dan Leff/HOU/EES@EES Subject: CONFIDENTIAL - Residential in CA In the meeting today no decision was made about what to do with Enron's 16000 residential customers.

Steven J Kean@ENRON 05/23/2001 06:40 PM To: Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT@ECT Mary Joyce/Enron@EnronXGate cc: Subject: Conversation with Wanda Curry Today Mary Joyce and I met with Wanda Curry. I realize that there is some concern that Wanda is a litigation threat so for the purposes of soliciting legal advice and in anticipation of litigation I am forwarding my recollection of today's meeting to you: Wanda remains very emotional about what she perceives as unfair and discriminatory treatment. When I asked her what she meant specifically (and did she intend those terms to have their legal meaning) she said that she did not intend the legal meaning of those terms rather she on a personal level felt that the company should have treated her better. She mentioned specifically: that no one ever called to explain in detail why she had not been further promoted at Enron or given more responsibility at Enron that she viewed the job in Sally Beck's organization as unsatisfactory (because Sally should be treated as a peer not a superior) and that she felt as though she did not have the support of upper management of the company. I described several options for her: Take the job she was offered in Sally Beck's organization Take the job in Rick Buy's organization (I said I would have to talk to Rick again) Take severence under the standard package Take severence as a business reorg but consult with Enron for a period. At first she seemed most interested in the fourth option (although she wasn't particularly happy about any of the alternatives) but at the end of the discussion expressed interest in the second option. A large part of the conversation involved discussion of Wanda's complaints about how she had been treated. Most of Wanda's concerns focussed on jobs she did not get or jobs she felt were taken from her reduced scope of control and the fact that she felt that her supervisors did not communicate with her sufficiently prior to or subsequent to making their decisions about job assignments. I suggested that there were likely two sides to the story and that most of the problem was insufficient communication or perhaps some insensitivity. I also pointed out that in all my conversations I heard good things about her performance and had no indication that anyone had treated her unfairly. Wanda did complain about many things but never once complained about her pay at Enron. Mary these are my recollections from today. Do you have anything to add?

If the Equilon Board gives the go-ahead for Equilon to pursue this transaction  Equilon will probably want to sign a memorandum of understanding with us and this may put us in a disclosure posture because at that point we would be looking at a $65 million deal (approx.) with a closure probability of no less than 20% (in my judgment based upon our past dealings with these people). Even without a signed document the size/probability test would still be an issue for us to deal with. Everyone should be thinking about this issue as we await word from Equilon's Board. Thanks.

Jeff Dasovich Sent by: Jeff Dasovich 03/16/2001 10:54 AM To: James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Joe Hartsoe/Corp/Enron@ENRON Linda Robertson/NA/Enron@ENRON Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@ENRON skean@enron.com Subject: Re: Analysis by Academics----Why De-regulation is the right policy choice Great points. Teece---and the lion's share of the folks on the participants list---are advocates of a minimalist role for government particularly where markets are a clear and preferably option as in the case of electricity. That said I think we're going to have to make a fundamental decision about what the goal of this study would be which will determine to a large degree whether we choose to pursue it. I'll throw out for comment the notion that the study should be designed to serve one purpose: to influence the policy decision currently under debate To de-regulate or not. As such I wouldn't see issues like PJM or APX or competitive default supplier or not or divest generation with vesting contracts or retain the assets being the focus. That debate over critically important implementation details would seem to come in Round 2 once the initial debate over deregulate or not is won. To try to do both i.e. resolve in the broad policy issue AND make the case for the specific right implementation plan would arguably bog the study down perhaps interminably. And it seems that time is of the essence in the current environment. In addition unless the fundamental policy issue is won--and won rather quickly--debating implementation may be moot. Of course it will be impossible to avoid some level of dicussion on how to do it but that would not be the emphasis. In sum I'd suggest for comment that it only makes sense to proceed---particularly since time is of the essence---if we focus on the high level policy level question of to deregulate or not and address implementation in a second or follow up study. I think we should try to make a call on this swiftly since the go/no go decision would seem to flow from resolution of this issue.

Clearly we're at a fork in the policy road---move forward or go back. I've (finally) gotten a proposal from the group. It's attached. Please take a look. I'd like to distribute more widely internally for comment but wanted to run it through a preliminary screen to guage whether folks think it would be useful before cluttering up folks' in-boxes with more emails to read. Few points worth mentioning: The majority of the academics that would do the report are affiliated with LECG Inc. the consulting group that I worked with prior to joing Enron. List also includes Dan McFadden UC Berkeley nobel prize winner who wrote the recent op-ed piece in the WSJ. The list also includes Hogan and Joskow and Borenstein. We could certainly exclude these folks should we choose to go forward with the analysis. However the goal is to produce a high level analysis i.e. de-regulation is good and can work command and control regulation is bad and we know that it does not work. Once the study is released (if it is pursued) the authors could tour the country testifying before federal and state bodies to advocate the virtues of de-regulation and the pitfalls of reversing course. The analysis would not be a debate over To Poolco or not to Poolco PJM etc. In this way including folks like Joskow and Hogan could offer the added benefit of creating a Nixon goes to China scenario. Please take a look at the list of participants. Again we can add to and subtract from the list. Laura Tyson would be one of the two project leaders. (The other would be David Teece Chairman of LECG.) None of the folks on the list occupies either extreme of the political spectrum. It's a mix of D's and R's who are arguably centrist economist and strong believers in markets (I won't vouch for Joskow and Hogan). The idea would be to get a wide array of industry participants from across the country to support the project. This is for two reasons: 1) the more diverse the group supporting the effort the greater the credibility and 2) they are asking for about $1 million to do the study. If you think it would be useful to pursue the study as part of our national campaign to minimize the damage created by California I would like to start immediately to approach trade associations companies customers etc. nationwide to garner support for the project. Let me know if you think the effort would be worthwhile. Appreciate your comments. Best Jeff  [/INST] Category: Company Business, Strategy, etc.(elaborate in Section 3 [Topics])"

TERRIE JAMES@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 07/05/2001 01:09 PM To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: Funky Business Steve Have you had a chance to look at the book Funky Business and to give any thought to having Jonas present at the Management Conference? I know you have a thousand other things on your plate not the least of which is California so I understand if the answer is no. However they've been contacted by someone else about the date so we may be forced to decide rather soon. On a related subject I'm contemplating another topic for the conference. I'd seen an article in Fortune several months ago titled Managing for the Slowdown. It talked about new challenges managers face in light of the economic downturn. (Most young managers have never experienced anything but boom times.) The article also outlines a dozen or so things companies should be thinking about now. (Use the downturn as a new opportunity to evaluate people. Overhaul your budget process. Don't stop communicating. etc.) I think it would be beneficial to address similar strategies and ideas with our managers. I'd love to get your thoughts on this idea. (Is it appropriate for Enron or am I just seeing the world through bleak-colored glasses?)

I would suggest Jean Ryall - who heads our Texas government/regulatory affairs team.

From: Susan Skarness/ENRON@enronXgate on 05/04/2001 11:20 AM To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Maureen McVicker/NA/Enron@Enron Subject: Beta Gamma Sigma Steve I am a member of Beta Gamma Sigma (BGS) the honor society for business programs accredited by AASCB - The International Association for Management Education. If you are not familiar with BGS a member must be in the upper 5% of their class as a junior and the upper 10% as a senior and in graduate school to be nominated for induction into the society. In an effort to provide additional programs and benefits to alumni members alumni chapters are being developed around the country. There are currently nine alumni chapters around the U.S. with a new one being formed in the Houston area. I am serving on a steering committee for the development of this Houston Area Alumni Chapter. Our primary reasons for starting a Houston Area Chapter include networking professional affiliations outreach to students resources learning opportunities and providing scholarships. Our initial outreach to Beta Gamma Sigma members will be through a reception/dinner to be held in October 2001. We are currently looking at either October 16 or 18. All 6200 Houston area members will be invited to participate however we expect attendance to be closer to 75-100 people. The ages experiences and business affiliation of the members will be very diverse but all will have the common thread of business excellence. The details of this event are still being finalized however at our last meeting the discussion encompassed possible speakers and topics. Overwhelmingly the team decided on Electricity Deregulation in Texas and since I work at Enron I was asked to assist in locating a dynamic speaker. Cliff Baxter suggested that you would be an ideal speaker on this topic. Are you available and willing to address this group in October? If I can provide any additional information please let me know. Thank you for your consideration Steve. [/INST] Category: Logistic Arrangements(meeting scheduling, technical support, etc)"

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- California's Electricity Oversight Board has ordered the state's Power Exchange to hand over confidential information to the board regarding the trading activities of utilities generation companies and other market participants who traded power at the exchange since June according to a copy of a subpoena obtained by Dow Jones Newswires. The subpoena marks the first time the state will gain access and learn how each company traded power in the day-of day-ahead and block forward markets. Moreover the EOB subpoena requests the CalPX release the names of the participants who traded power at the exchange since June to better understand how and why the participants conduct business in the various markets at the exchange. The CalPX has until Wednesday to hand over aggregate supply and demand curves individual firm bid dates final schedules for each firm by generating unit injection point and take out point from June 1 through September and continue supplying trading data through Nov. 1. In addition the subpoena requests block forward trade positions by firm for June July August and September and that this information continue to be supplied through October and November. The subpoena is part of the state's ongoing investigation into California's troubled deregulated electricity market which has resulted in high wholesale power prices in San Diego landmark legislative action and accusations of collusion price gouging and market power. Gov. Gray Davis ordered an investigation in June when power prices soared to near record levels and rolling blackouts wreaked havoc in the Bay Area. The CalPX said it will comply with the EOB request and that a subpoena to access the confidential information is required according to the rules of the exchange. But the EOB will be required to protect the confidentiality of each trade it gains insight into as well as the identities of the participants who traded. If the trading activities of a company or other participant is leaked or becomes public it could have a devastating affect on the company and the EOB would be held liable according to the CalPX. The CalPX said it must notify each and every participant who traded power in its various markets to alert them of the EOB subpoena. -By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires 323-658-3874 jason.leopold@dowjones.com Folder Name: Utilities Electric: Retail Wheeling Relevance Score on Scale of 100: 53 To review or revise your folder visit Dow Jones CustomClips or contact Dow Jones Customer Service by e-mail at custom.news@bis.dowjones.com or by phone at 800-369-7466.

I only suggest this so we can stay out of the limelight by not being one of the bad guy generators who are actively taking on the protective order when we know that at least four generators are producing nothing until their motion is resolved and one marketer (Coral/Shell Energy) has refused to produce transactional data and has objected to most of the document request. I have also recently learned that Calpine has gotten an extension until Oct. 13 and will try to delay and hold off producing much data.

A couple of comments for your consideration: On page three we describe the change to the definition of Public Utility an= d then argue that we don't fit into it. Would it be worth explaining why t= hat makes sense? Specifically the New Jersey restructuring law like most= efforts of its kind in other markets is designed to separate the competit= ive from monopoly elements of the power (and gas) businesses. Economic reg= ulation would then be restricted to the remaining monopoly elements of the = business (eg distribution). The competitive market can not be solely relie= d upon to regulate the behavior of monopoly asset owners such as distrib= ution utilities. Therefore regulators continue to be called upon to set p= ricing and other terms of service. What those regulators decide matters a = great deal to those monopoly utilities and it consequently makes sense for = lawmakers to be concerned about attempts by such entities to use campaign c= ontributions to tacitly influence decision makers. The same public policie= s simply do not apply to that portion of the market which is competitive. = The generation and sales business has a competitive structure (i.e. relativ= ely low barriers to entry multiple competitors etc.). These components of= the power and gas business can be regulated by the market with respect t= o rates and terms of service. They do not require economic regulation any = more than grocery stores department stores appliance sellers or other re= tailers (who presumably are not prohibited from making contributions. Com= petition and markets discipline behavior and establish competitive prices a= nd terms of service. Because regulators don't set the prices and terms of = service for such sellers there is no reason to be concerned about campaign= contribuitions from such organizations. Indeed the legislation and the = legislative history clearly conform to this underlying policy rationale. As a former practicing lawyer I certainly understand the value of pleading= in the alternative. But I question how certain of our arguments woud be = perceived by the public if they ever came to light (which these documents h= ave a habit of doing).. . I can just see the press seizing on Enron's clai= m of ignorance or mistake or the fact that we pled for the favorable exer= cise of prosecutorial discretion. I suggest that we add whatever we feel= is necessary to the very solid looking intent argument not make specific = reference to ignorance or mistake and not plead for the favorable esxerc= ise of PD. If we feel we need to write about this last item perhaps we co= uld suggest that it would be a waste of the public's resources to pursue a = claim under such circumstances.

As I understand it there are two aspects of this: 1. The offer of Enron and others last year to sell power to California utilities for 5 cents per kw. Failure to accept these offers resulted in higher power costs in the range of $15 billion as I recall from yesterday's call. 2. The long term contracts that California signed this year after taking actions and making statements that drove up the forward price curves are now under water to the tune of $20 billion. On both counts we will be pressed for assumptions and documentation to pursue these arguments which parallel the comments made by senior management in Capitol Hill meeting last week. We will work on back up on this end but we would greatly appreciate your assistance in this regard as well. With Congress out of session starting COB on Thursday we will need information pulled together by tomorrow COB to get the final product in the hands of congressional types and others who can use it on a timely basis.

In the Stip we argue that PJM should be approved by FERC but condition our acceptance on a FERC process to unify the Northeast markets. My only comment is to delete the final WHEREAS paragraph on congestion management. While our ability to later stop PJM from being an RTO is limited I believe that this gives us the ability to drive a consolidation of the Northeast markets - which is one of the goals of the East Power desk. In addition I think that the overall direction of PJM in commercializing its software is a good activity for our interest - even if we don't want everything in their package.

It is looking positive that he may be positioned to make the announcement Monday. However DOE will likely need to revisit some folks on the current Blue Ribbon Reliability Panel in order to replace some of the utility transmission-only focused members with others who focus on business practices plus add additional people to represent the internet like APX Altra and HoustonStreet.Com. (these are Steve Kean's suggestions.) Too I have been cautioned about referring to the Blue Ribbon Reliability Panel as a model since their timeline was slow but rather suggest the TVA Blue Ribbon Panel model since they were able to issue a report after only four meetings. I have asked for this issue to be brought to Secretary Richardson's attention and advised this will be done this week. I have also discussed this with John Anderson of ELCON who is supportive.

What do you think about having Nels make the call to Lundquist just to find out what his status is what he might look for when his current assignment is over etc. (obviously without identifying us -- presumably Nels would have reason to talk to him anyway in the normal course of business)?

Linda Robertson 03/13/2001 02:16 PM To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: Andrew Lundquist I got your message about Andrew. He would be an excellent catch. However I see a couple of significant problems. My guess is that Andrew is too senior for this position particularly after having chaired the Cheney task force. Also I would not anticipate that he would be available for several months if then. We should fill this position immediately. We are already missing opportunities because this position is vacant. As for our search using Korn Ferry I have narrowed the field to two very good candidates. I am setting up time for Rick to interview these candidates next Monday. The first candidate is Drew Maloney with Rep. Tom Delay's office. Drew would give us enormous visibility in House Republican leadership circles seems trustworthy and capable of learning most of the substance of the energy portfolio. Drew has strong networking skills which I think would nicely fit with Tom's strategic and technical skills. The second candidate is John Shelk whom I have known for nearly 15 years. John was the lead Republican staff on the House Energy and Commerce Committee under Norm Lent. John left the Committee in 1992. Since then John has worked in the financial services and gaming industries where he has enhanced his political and Republican networking skills. John in very short order would have extremely strong technical skills atlhough he has been away from the industry for eight years. I believe both candidates bring different but very strong talents to the job. I have a second opening for an enviromental advocate. I am discussing with Rick the possibility of whether we could redirect one of these candidates (probably John) to that slot. That said please let me know if I should have Nels pursue Andrew.

Although until that moment I hadn't thought of returning to Washington except to serve again in national office I would be pleased to talk further about this opportunity with you or your recruiter. In recalling our conversation I realize that twice you asked if I had any questions and if I had been quick to take advantage of your offer I would have asked how government relations are handled at Enron. To whom does Joe Hillings report: to you or to Terry Thorne? You mentioned a woman who currently has responsibility for government relations in Texas and some neighboring states but is leaving for another job at Enron to whom does she report? Then there is Joe Allen whom I have known since our days in the Legislature doesn't he (also) handle Texas affairs? I am sorry I didn't ask you all this on Tuesday. Whatever the answers it's clear that government relations are much more central to the work of Enron than at Compaq which is why it would be a very exciting place to work.

The people in my organization support all the Enron business units but many are specifically dedicated to certain business units. As a consequence we have ended up on a variety of LANs with a variety of support people. Due to the fine efforts of your team many people in my group have migrated over to the Enron Corp LAN. We are also now enjoying great support from Russell & Russell (Servat and Mitchell). As the IT guy I'm sure you are accustomed to such profuse praise. However many of the people on my team (including me) are on the EES LAN. Historically EES has supported us with the equipment we need and they too have been doing a fine job in that regard. Historically therefore we have not budgeted for IT .... a practice which will change starting next year. In the meantime when we sought to migrate the rest of my organization to the CORP LAN we were told that we would have to pay for all of our current equipment or give it back to EES.

We m= et at my request to discuss Barton RTO draft.

They do not expect the Barton Subcommittee to mark up the electricity l= egislation this year. Time is running out and Members of the subcommittee = are not focused on the issue. Instead they plan to continue working on th= e issue at the staff level. Probably will be another draft version circula= ted and then a version will be introduced by Barton as a formal bill by the= end of the year. The earliest they see any kind of vote is late Jan. or ea= rly February. =20 2. Barton feels strongly that FERC should not be the tail wagging the do= g on RTO policy. =20 3. On particulars of the bill they are clearly reconsidering the 40000 = MW minimum threshold for the size of an RTO. They are getting pulled in bo= th directions they say and are inclined to drop the 40000 MW number -- p= ossibly leaving it to FERC to set a number. They conceded that the mechani= cs of the draft make it unlikely that the 18 month deadline for all trans= mission owners to get into an approved RTO would stick. They consciously c= hanged the normal judicial standard of review for FERC actions from arbitr= ary and capricious to preponderance of the evidence because they think o= therwise the courts will rubber stamp FERC. Spent a lot of time on how the= draft would aid and abet the recalcitrant utilities and that the overall n= ature of the draft assumes there are only two parties to this -- FERC and t= he transmission owners -- while the rest of those truly affected -- from us= to others -- are left out. Sean said we could still intervene but I said= that was the truly pro forma aspect of their process since FERC's hands an= d our's would be tied by the rights given to transmission owners to drag = their feet. =20 Bottom line -- FERC has a window until next Spring without likely congressi= onal interference at least not of the formal legislative variety to both= move on RTOs and improve its relations with Congress. FERC staff has been= pushing the committee staff on concerns similar to our concerns. [/INST] Category: Company Business, Strategy, etc.(elaborate in Section 3 [Topics])"

In order to move forward Janet Dietrich will be meeting with me when I go to Houston next Thursday. (I must confess that after all the great things I have heard about the man I do look forward to meeting Dave himself.) Is there a time next week that I can speak with you by phone to fine-tune my thinking / preparation for Thursday's meeting with Janet? Thank you for your all of your help.

Your communications are always complete firm clear and polite. I am sorry that perhaps the most critical aspect of your efforts -- security-- has been so confused by our end. I understand from John Brindle that the confusion generated by our end has not kept you from accomplishing a great deal of the work anyway. I have asked John to lead the effort to the extent you need him. John and his team are very experienced and have been in contact with and coordination with the London office. Mike Hicks is a good hand but for the most part all I have asked him to do is be in a position to identify outside resources skilled in the area in question. It is a bit too much to ask Mike to be hands on for all of Enron's corporate security needs. A little background I'll bore you with: after Andre Legallo (formerly VP of Security for Enron) left we did not replace his function. Most of the operating companies had their own security and business controls groups. When Andre left we reduced the corporate function to a default provider role -- if a business unit had a need it was not otherwise meeting Mike Hicks (as well as an outside consulting firm) would help identify competent resources in the area. With the reorganization of EBS I have inherited the very competent and experienced team they had assembled (led by John Brindle). John identified some concerns regarding India mid last week. I urged him to get in touch with Rebecca he did. It was clear after further inquiries by John that the India team had already addressed many if not all of the concerns and much of the remaining work involved implementation. John volunteered to send some people over to help and I said OK. He had already been in touch with the London team and Mike Hicks (who I have asked to return to Houston). The last thing you need right now is confusion caused by a group saying we're from corporate and we're here to help. If you don't need any help or if the situation gets anything other than significantly better let me know. To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Rebecca McDonald/Enron@EnronXGate James A Hughes/Enron@EnronXGate Subject: India Help Steve As you are well aware we are facing a lot of things happening fast in India. We are using several parts of your team and are very pleased with most. I want to mention a couple of areas HR and Security. 1. HR: I heard that some folks in Houston had raised concerns about the quality of the India HR team and their preparedness. The HR team is doing an outstanding job and I wanted you to hear that from me. Once we realized we had a major issue on our hand and I received clearance from Rebecca and Jim to bring some HR folks into the loop HR had someone on a plane within 20 hours of my first call. We have always had great HR support through Drew Lynch and Bob Sparger helping our team led by Sandip Malik and this time Scott Gilchrist has joined in and helped as well. But the two workhorses have been Bob and Sandip. Bob got on a plane immediately and came over and he and Sandip have been working around the clock so that we are much better prepared now than we were just a couple of days back. We really relied heavily on HR and Drew had his team there for us. 2. PR: top notch team of John Ambler and Johan Zaayman working with and supporting Jimmy Mogal on the ground. Johan and Jimmy have been a strong team on the ground and John has provided leadership and all coordination with Houston. Great efforts and productive work. 3. Security: This area has not worked as well and if you ever want feedback on our one-time experience with this group I will provide it. I don't have any idea who is in charge from Enron's perspective here. There are 2 groups headed this way. Mike Hicks will arrive Thursday night and Mike has informed us that he will be leading all security efforts. Jim Rountree is apparently travelling with Mike and Don Hawkins sent me an e-mail earlier today telling me that Don has instructed Jim that Jim is in charge of coordinating our security. John Brindle has sent me an e-mail saying that you have asked him to coordinate and help in the ongoing efforts and John is sending 3 people over arriving Saturday night. First we are very happy to have the help but I just hope that Mike Jim and John know which of the three are in charge. If you could just let me know who you want to be in charge we will coordinate with that person. On a side note the people who have really been helpful were brought in through Drew Lynch of Europe HR. They are Jim Roth and Dave Lawler both of whom work for John Sherriff. They had a great attitude were willing to work day and night and were planning on coming to coordinate until Mike decided he would come. At Mike's earlier suggestion we engaged Hill & Associates to help on security. Because I was having to meet with them 3 to 4 times per day I asked Jane Wilson to help coordinate all our security efforts. Jane has done a fantastic job in an impossibly short time frame. The tasks she has been overseeing include coordinating with Hill & Associates removing (in a lowkey yet rush manner) over 400 boxes of files and documents and getting them through customs and to Europe removing 2 container truck loads of files from the Dabhol site and getting them out of the country and overseeing a complete security check and file removal of all our electronic files from servers desktops and laptops. In addition she has coordinated security for all expats and families as well as worked with EOGIL expats and Anthony Duenner of EBS Asia. Again we appreciate all the help.

I am open minded on the issue if someone can make a compelling case to support stand alone legislation BUT my gut reaction is that it would be a serious mistake. Congress would happily put off dealing with this issue for years if it passes reliability only legislation. I think the legislation itself makes little or no progress on our issues and may even set us back on making progress at FERC and in other fora. I realize that if this gets going it may be hard to stop but it would be such a cynically ineffective approach to the real reliability problems that we should help whomever we can to put a stop to it. If it gets through committee I have no confidence in this Congress to actually amend it into something better and broader so again I have difficulty seeing why we should go that route. I look forward to the discussion.

Allison is arranging a brief (thirty minutes) Conference Call for sometime tomorrow so we can assure that we are all on the same page on this issue.

However given Jeff Brown's efforts the political need for inoculation and other political developments it is timely to once again discuss Enron's position.

In ERCOT Enron is in support of nodal pricing. I would not go so far as to say we are pushing for PJM's implementation however but for a market with nodal prices (and unilateral bids - aka unbalanced schedules congestion reflect by price differentials etc). I was unaware PJM had such great power to alter bids. This is something we don't want and something for which I am not aware we have advocated. Perhaps in Enron's promotion of locational prices it has been retold as PJM-style locational prices. Given that PJM is the most commonly cited example of locational prices it does not surprise me to have the sloppiness in discussions that could lead to the rumors.

I'm still awaiting additional suggestions from anyone on speakers. I guess Lee's e-mail changes things. If the business school wants to go forward with a conference anyway then it may be a bad idea to have a separate one. Jeff has said he likes the idea of coordinating. Bill and Allen what do you think? I will chime in that Carl Shapiro is very much a big wig as a former chief economist at DOJ. As for the Frank Wolak suggestion Frank is a Stanford economist who is an outstanding analyst and has published probably more than anyone else on electricity market design performance regarding the UK Australia and California. He speaks a mile a minute though and his understanding of policy and politics is a bit naive. I should note that ICF will not be able to contribute. I heard from Michael Berg this morning. So he will not be participating in our discussions either. My opinion is let's do whatever is best for the school. One positive outcome of this would be stronger relationships with some of the University's top notch economic policy faculty. Overshadowing is possible.

The speakers were Howard Useem Republican counsel to the Senate Energy Committee and Jimmy Glotfelty senior policy advisory to the Secretary of Energy. Useem said Senate Energy Committee Republicans were meeting later this morning to finalize their energy proposal. (We later learned that they opted against including any electricity provisions not even the PURPA PUHCA and reliability issues that Howard thought might be included when he spoke before the senators met this is good news since it makes it less likely that anti-FERC provisions will be added.) (Howard said now is the best time to legislative on electricity because the Supreme Court has not yet acted on the bundling/unbundling issue.) On RTOs in some what of a surprise Useem said that there is general support among Senate Republicans for RTOs including consolidating them into a few RTOs of large scope (surprising since this is not what we have heard in meetings with individual Senate offices). While he said that he also said that support is stronger in the abstract than in specifics. He said the biggest opposition was coming from very vocal state regulators (EPSA staff did a good job of pointing to state regulators mainly in the Midwest who support larger RTOs). Most importantly Howard said none of the senators on his committee take a not over my dead body approach to RTOs. Jimmy Glotfelty explained to several EPSA members who asked questions just why it is that the Administration wants Congress to be silent on RTOs. He said while they would prefer a sentence or two affirming FERC's authority they do not believe this is what would come out of the legislative process. They are not willing to run that risk. He stressed that the president wants to include other electricity issues. He said they were very close to an agreement with Western governors on regional transmission siting. Jimmy further said that the Administration also wants silence on incentive rates another issue where FERC can act now. They continue to talk to Barton and his staff in an attempt to get them to back away from the restrictive approach to RTOs in the Barton discussion draft. (He said Pat Wood spent several hours with Barton and other House committee staff yesterday.) Of concern Jimmy said something like could be 4 RTOs could be 8 RTOs what is important is getting standard design. He also said DOE will make sure that PMAs are included in RTOs.

While we have not seen the text we are told that it is anti-RTO and may go so far as to state or imply that FERC does not have authority to do what is doing with RTOs. (We know this is the view of one of Chairman Tauzin's counsels who formerly worked for Southern Co.). Chairman Tauzin has been contacted by Entergy and the Louisiana Public Service Commission to send the letter. I spoke to Chairman Barton's staff Andy Black this afternoon and relayed our concerns. The Barton Subcommittee is now expected to mark up an electricity bill in December (per a Republican Member meeting held this morning). ACTION ITEM: Call Rep. Joe Barton (202/225-2002) TALKING POINTS: 1. Should start with something about the Dynegy/Enron transaction (it will be strange if Mr. Lay or Steve calls Chairman Barton and does not start the conversation with some reference to the transaction). 2. Mentioning the transaction naturally leads into the importance of competitive wholesale markets for power both for consumers and for the largely Texas-based marketing trading and merchant power industries. 3. We understand that Chairman Barton has been approached by Chairman Tauzin about a letter to FERC on the RTO issue. We know Chairman Barton is well aware of Enron's strong support for FERC's RTO initiatives. We respect Chairman Barton's interest in seeing to it that Congress does not abdicate its responsibility to make energy policy. 4. If as we have been lead to believe the letter states or implies that FERC does not have authority to act in the RTO arena this will be seen as a potentially destabilizing development since FERC is so far down the road of creating RTOs. 5. While we understand some in Congress and elsewhere were concerned that FERC was moving too fast as of the last FERC meeting earlier this month that is no longer true even if it ever was true. While we think RTOs should be created sooner rather than later FERC is listening to state regulators and others who had concerns. 6. A letter from congressional leaders questioning FERC's authority goes too far in the direction of those who oppose any RTOs. Furthermore it is wrong as a matter of law. The D.C. Circuit held in the gas cases and in the power cases on Order 888 that FERC has authority to address systemic discrimination which is in large part what the RTOs are all about -- a remedy for iscrimination.

Of course if there is a way to come up with a similar number using publicly available data (or if we are willing to provide our numbers if pressed) then all the better. In the mean time should I hold off on using the $13.8 billion number until I hear back from you about the conversation with Steve? Also do I understand correctly from Alan that the $13.8 billion figure is NOT comparing the long term contracts California signed with recent spot market prices but rather is a comparison of the contracts to our present forward pricing curves? From you e-mail it is the latter I take it. As to point #1 on the deal last year we just need a similar back of the envelope calculation on what California could have saved had California taken us up on the offers we and others made. Any guidance on where to get that would be most helpful. [/INST] Category: Company Business, Strategy, etc.(elaborate in Section 3 [Topics])"

RABIN and DARYL KELLEY TIMES STAFF WRITERS The Securities and Exch= ange Commission has launched a preliminary inquiry into whether energy con= sultants advising Gov. Gray Davis used inside information to trade stocks = of power companies doing business with the state a source with knowledge = of the matter said Monday. The federal agency began its review late last = week the source said in response to a request from California Secretary = of State Bill Jones. A Republican rival of Davis Jones charged that stock= trading by consultants may have violated federal laws barring buying and = selling based on information not available to the public. On Friday top = aides to the governor disclosed that five consultants had been fired for = possible conflicts of interest between their official positions and their = personal finances. As news of the SEC inquiry spread through the capital M= onday Davis officials were confronted by a flurry of questions about who = in the administration owns energy stocks. Financial disclosure records fi= led by the governor's spokesman Steve Maviglio show that he owns between= $10000 and $100000 in a Texas company he and his boss have accused of m= aking obscene profits while California has been on its knees. Maviglio= said he bought the shares in Houston-based Enron Corp. in 1996. It's no= t a crime to own energy stock Maviglio said. He also owns 300 shares of= San Jose-based Calpine Corp. which has the largest share of the $43 bill= ion in long-term state power contracts. Maviglio placed the order for the= stock on May 31 one day after San Jose's mayor dropped his opposition to= a controversial Calpine plant favored by the governor and others. Under t= he terms of Maviglio's purchase the transaction was completed about three= weeks later when the stock reached $40 a share a value of $12000. It ha= s since fallen in value. I viewed it as a good long-term investment M= aviglio said adding that he purchased the shares for his retirement accou= nt based on publicly available information. The Davis administration has = spared Calpine the kind of fierce criticisms that it has leveled at other = electricity suppliers such as Enron. But California's grid operator has i= dentified the company as one of many energy merchants to overcharge the st= ate millions of dollars. The fired consultants also owned shares in Calpi= ne ranging in value from several thousand dollars to more than $100000 = records show. Another top Davis administration official legal affairs s= ecretary Barry Goode disclosed in his economic interest statement that he= recently held between $100000 and $1 million in another out-of-state com= pany accused of multimillion-dollar price gouging. In a statement Goode = said he sold his stock in Williams Co's. a month after he began working fo= r the governor in February. Goode said the shares were supposed to be sold= before he went on the state payroll but his broker failed to do so. In = light of the recent disclosures Secretary of State Jones said the governo= r must do more to ensure the public that its interest comes first. The g= overnor should direct all of his staff to immediately file updated conflic= t of interest statements that reflect current holdings and any activity si= nce their last statement of economic interest was filed said Jones who = is seeking the GOP nomination for governor. Word of the SEC's entry into = California's energy problems comes as the governor faces harsh criticism f= rom lawmakers and others for the quick and broad hiring of highly paid pri= vate consultants to guide him through the crisis. In his written request = to the SEC Jones said that recently filed disclosure documents showed tha= t at least one consultant bought and sold shares of two energy companies w= ithin the same month raising a red flag about the possibility of inside= r trading. State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions= involving their personal financial interests. The five consultants fired= last week were among 11 named in Jones' letter delivered to the San Fran= cisco office of the SEC last Wednesday. It was not clear which individuals= are the focus of the SEC's inquiry or whether the agency's review would = result in any charges. Two of the former traders said Monday that they ha= d not been contacted by federal investigators and knew nothing of an inqui= ry into possible insider trading. But William Mead fired Thursday said = it is no mystery why so many of his colleagues owned Calpine stock. Mead = said he bought it 2 1/2 years ago and made so much money he recommended it= to his colleagues last year while they all still worked for the now-defu= nct California Power Exchange in Alhambra. Calpine power was not traded on= that exchange so there was no conflict of interest he said. Mead and = three other energy traders--hired by the state in February and March--were= terminated by the Davis administration for allegedly buying power for the= state from Calpine while owning the company's stock. Fired traders Herman= Leung Peggy Cheng and Constantine Louie did not list the date of their C= alpine purchases on financial statements that the state required to be fil= ed only two weeks ago. But I'm sure they bought it while they were still= at the power exchange because that's when we discussed it Mead said. = It was kind of like a hobby. I'm sure it wasn't done with the intent to ma= nipulate. Former trader Elaine Griffin who also owned Calpine stock and= resigned two weeks ago to take another job said she didn't know she owne= d energy securities until she checked with her financial advisor July 13 = just before leaving her state job. Griffin said she and her husband own a= bout $10000 worth of Calpine stock in individual retirement accounts mana= ged by their advisor who bought the stock Feb. 1 without their knowledge= she said after research found it to be a good investment. I kind of fe= el like we've been used for political reasons Griffin said. We would ha= ve disclosed anything right at first but they never asked. As a trader=  Griffin said she occasionally bought Calpine power for the state but on= ly at market prices. Meanwhile two Democratic political consultants who= helped Davis polish his image after the ongoing energy crisis caused his = poll numbers to plummet have agreed to accept no payment for their work a= s part of an out-of-court settlement of a taxpayer lawsuit. Tom Hiltachk= a lawyer for conservative anti-tax activist Lewis Uhler said the settlem= ent was reached last Friday after negotiations with lawyers for communicat= ions consultants Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane. Now they will not receiv= e one red cent said Hiltachk. Very simply Mr. Fabiani and Mr. Lehane ha= ve agreed to cease all activities for the governor to accept no payments = for their services and to basically get out of the consulting business wit= h the governor. As his part of the agreement Hiltachk said Uhler with= drew his lawsuit Monday morning. Uhler had filed a lawsuit against the tw= o consultants and Controller Kathleen Connell in June contending that they= should not receive any payments because of a conflict of interest. The tw= o men also did consulting work for financially troubled Southern Californi= a Edison which was seeking help from Davis and the Legislature. Connell= a former Los Angeles mayoral candidate who has been at odds with Davis si= nce he endorsed an opponent had held up the payments pending the outcome = of the lawsuit. Under an agreement with Davis the men were to have been = paid $30000 a month for six months. Fabiani and Lehane could not be reac= hed for comment. * Times staff writers Nancy Vogel and Virginia Ellis i= n Sacramento and Robert J.

Linda Robertson 05/11/2001 04:32 PM To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: Barton Bill You seemed troubled by the call to Barton. This bill may or may not be subsumed by the comprehensive energy bill that Congress undertakes this summer. Both bills have a very difficult if not nearly impossible path ahead given that the Democrats are in no mood for compromise. The call to Barton was to: a) repair relationships (and with the Wall Street Journal calling Barton about his troubled past with Enron repair is needed) b) proclaim victory even of a limited nature (something I think Enron has not done much of) c) build a further bond with Barton so we would have more input at full Committee (something we will need given the chances that this will go off the track are real) and d) allow Enron to get significant credit for the defeat of price caps. I hear from lots of DC sources that we have not had any success in the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Numerous folks at the markup noted in private conversations that this was Enron's first real role in the Committee. Thus even though this is a very limited bill the call made sense. I do not think that this means we should call the White House to push the bill with them. The bill itself still has lots of obstacles and many potential threats ahead.

Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term contracts whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for Davis. We've made suggestions we've offered various ways in which people could get us $8.9 billion Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday. You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you want to do it it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion. The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr. according to sources close to the negotiations. Yesterday Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach a compromise. What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood Wagner told reporters. In the event we're unable to do that [Friday] at some point I may offer a preliminary assessment. The settlement conference is set to conclude on Monday. Wagner FERC's chief administrative judge has been trying to push both sides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy. Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California's largest utility drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on. Last Friday Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative Michael Kahn chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in refunds from power generators and marketers was too high sources said. Wagner's settlement conference which has involved more than 100 lawyers for all sides is closed to the public and media. Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a joke that the parties might as well wear clown suits according to a Dow Jones report confirmed by sources close to the talks. But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers led by Reliant Energy Inc. Williams Energy Services Duke Energy and Southern Co. for failing to make serious settlement offers these sources said. The suppliers have offered to refund $600 million provided the state is able to call off various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds sources said. Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds but now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California's electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher refund figure some energy analysts believe. Davis's tactical change offering to make the long-term contracts part of an overall settlement comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have to pay for energy under those deals. California's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed deregulation plan which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at volatile spot market prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer so did the state's electricity bills. In response Davis's aide S. David Freeman and his staff began negotiating long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years. That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was paying at the beginning of this year but above current power prices -- and considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade energy analysts say. A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count as a refund because the deals were reached under commercial duress according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations. Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify. There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be said Michael Zenger California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a just and reasonable standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure. It's not rocket science but it does require the regulators to regulate said Frank Wolak a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight committee for the California grid. Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room billions of dollars apart as the talks approached their final weekend sources said.  2001 The Washington Post Company [/INST] Category: Company Business, Strategy, etc.(elaborate in Section 3 [Topics])"

The subcommittee approved an amendment by Mrs. Wilson to conduct a national assessment and inventory of possible renewable energy projects. During consideration of the bill several amendments of interest and concern to Enron were offered and withdrawn they are likely to be offered when the full Energy and Commerce Committee meets to consider the package next Tuesday and Wednesday. The amendments in this category are: 1. Mr. Waxman has an amendment he called the blackout and price gouging prevention amendment that would require FERC to modify its June 19 price mitigation order within 15 days of enactment to impose cost-of-service based rates (with a rate of return of 15 percent) if an entity is found to be withholding power from the grid during an emergency. The cost-of-service rates would thereafter apply to all of the offending entity's sales in the Western U.S. Several of us were rounding up opponents to the amendment when it was clear he was going to offer it and before he decided to withdraw it until full committee. We will continue those efforts before the full committee vote. 2. Mr. Ganske has an amendment on net metering that he said would promote wind in Iowa and other renewables (he may wait until an electricity bill rather than full committee on this bill). 3. Mr. Shadegg has an amendment to exempt natural gas pipelines from the requirements of the National Registry of Historic Places. He said that currently this process holds up much needed pipeline expansions that are FERC approved. 4. Mr. Waxman has an amendment that would require the President to develop and implement a plan to achieve the greenhouse gas reductions called for in a UN agreement that President George Bush (41) agreed to in 1992 (reducing these emissions to 1990 levels). Chairman Barton indicated that the Subcommittee will take up an electric restructuring bill either later this month or early in September depending on how long it takes to process this first energy package in the full committee and in the full House.

The reason that I share this with you is my respect for you as a CEO a business leader and a person. My wife is one of your employees who routinely shares stories about you that are nothing less than inspiring. I know that during difficult times sometimes words emerge that can help people through difficult times. I believe that you are sincere man and know that you must be broken hearted but I hope that this article can help you lead a dispirted workforce to see things more clearly. My wife Shelly Pierce has worked for Enron for the past two years and like many of your employees has lost a great deal of her life savings. Of course I accept most of the blame for this for reasons related to this article. I lost my investment discipline and held out the false hope that Enron could not falter. After reading the article to her while I was out of town I believe that her spirit was a bit rejuvenated and she was ready to face the challenges that lay before you. Mr. Lay I appreciate the opportunity that you have given my wife and our family and hope that this story inspires you to regain your successes. From the USA Today Tuesday November 27 2001 page 15A. In recession face brutal facts thrive By Jim Collins A man in his early 20s recently asked me So what's a recession like? Its an entirely alien concept to him he'd grown up during the greatest economic boom in modern memory. His question drove home the fact that we haven't faced a severe protracted economic setback for nearly 2 decades leaving us terribly unpracticed at dealing with tough times. With this recession - long in coming perhaps long to stay - now officially upon us it is imperative that corporate leaders relearn a key lesson about how great companies (and great people) deal with difficult times differently from how they deal with merely good ones. That lesson is the Stockdale Paradox a peculiar psychology shown by those who emerge from tough times not just intact but stronger. Adm. Jim Stockdale was the highest-ranking U.S. military officer in the Hanoi prison camp during the Vietnam War. Tortured many times during his 8-year imprisonment Stockdale lived without any prisoner's rights no set release date and no certainty as to whether he would ever again see his family. He shouldered the burden of command while fighting an internal war against his captors and their attempts to use the prisoners for propaganda. At one point he beat himself with a stool and cut himself with a razor deliberately disfiguring himself so that he could not be put on video as an example of a well-treated prisoner. He exchanged secret intelligence information with his wife through their letters knowing that discovery would mean more torture and perhaps death. After his release Stockdale became the first three-star officer in the history of the Navy to wear both aviator wings and the Congressional Medal of Honor. You can understand then my anticipation at the prospect of spending part of an afternoon with Stockdale who happened to be at the Hoover Institute across the street from my office when I taught at Stanford. In preparation I read In Love and War the book he and his wife wrote to chronicle their experiences those 8 years. As I read the book I found myself getting depressed. It just seemed so bleak - the uncertainty of his fate the brutality of his captors. And then it dawned on me: Here I am sitting in my warm comfortable office looking out over the Stanford campus on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. I'm getting depressed reading this and I know that he gets out reunites with his family and becomes a national hero. If it feels depressing for me how on earth did he deal with it when he was actually there and did not know the end of the story? I never lost faith in the end of the story Stockdale said when I asked him. I never doubted not only that I would get out but also that I would prevail in the end and turn the experience into the defining event of my life that in retrospect I would not trade. I didn't say anything for many minutes and we continued the slow walk toward the faculty club Stockdale limping and arc-swinging his leg still stiff from repeated torture. Finally I asked Who didn't make it out? Oh that's easy he said. The optimists. The optimists? I don't understand I said completely confused. The optimists. Oh they were the ones who said 'We're going to be out by Christmas.' And Christmas would come and Christmas would go. Then they'd say 'We're going to be out by Easter.' And Easter would come and Easter would go. And then Thanksgiving and then it would be Christmas again. And they died of a broken heart. After another long pause he turned to me and said This is a very important lesson. You must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the end - which you can never afford to lose - with the need for discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality whatever they might be. My conversation with Stockdale had a profound influence on me but I never really considered it a business lesson until my research team began to wrestle with the question of why some companies rise from difficulty to become great while others emerge from those exact same difficulties weakened and dispirited. We found that companies that became great embraced a corporate version of the Stockdale Paradox. Fannie Mae for example found itself in the 1982 recession losing $1M every business day with $56B in loans under water. Many analysts thought Fannie Mae which was getting 9% on its mortgage portfolio but paying 15% on the debt it issued was doomed. But CEO David Maxwell and his team never wavered in their aim to not merely survive but also to prevail as a great company. Yes they confronted the brutal fact that the interest-rate problem was not going to magically disappear (certainly not by Christmas). But they used this grim fact as a catalyst for creating an entirely new business model based on asking three central questions of greatness: What can we potentially do better than any other company in the world? What can best drive our economic engine? What best ignites the passions of our people? Instead of reacting to the recession with mindless restructuring Fannie Mae rebuilt itself based on its answers to these questions. Eventually it generated investor returns nearly eight times those of the general stock market. When asked how he dealt with the nay Sayers and the analysts who wrote Fannie Mae off Maxwell said that it was never an issue inside the company. Of course we had to stop doing a lot of stupid things but we never entertained the possibility that we would fail. We were going to use the calamity as an opportunity to remake Fannie Maw into a great company. The sad truth is that most executive teams won't respond that way to these dark days of uncertainty. Instead of using this recession as an opportunity to fundamentally rethink their business and rebuild a culture of discipline the will simply restructure lay off a bunch of people and liquidate their cultural equity. Mediocre leaders will hold out false hopes for a quick fix only to watch those hopes be swept away by events. Their companies will begin to die of a broken heart. It need not be this way. Those who lead with the Stockdale Paradox - those who retain the unwavering faith that they will find a way to prevail in the end but who also retain the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of reality - will find this an ideal time to rebuild and reinforce greatness. Used correctly this recession can be a defining time in your firm's history that  in retrospect you would not trade. Used wrongly this recession will weaken your foundations and make it that much harder to become great. The choice is yours.

I would like to include some discussions of what has been learned in other industries. As I indicated Frank Wolak suggested that I contact you. In discussing power markets with Frank and other colleagues at Stanford and EPRI it seems quite evident that real-time pricing for retail customers is the forgotten resource in more efficient power markets. There seems to be a lot of confusion about what RTP means and it also seems that many researchers need to address some practical but important problems. I was asked whether a group like Stanford's EMF might explore this topic and give it the visibility that would have it considered more seriously by policymakers. Frank thought that you might be someone who could help me structure a useful approach and who might also see whether Enron could become a major sponsor. I was hoping that this issue was sufficiently important to Enron that the company might consider providing $25000. As you may appreciate it requires some thought and effort to make sure that the product of the conference is widely circulated among key government groups. I would be very interested in hearing from you if you can provide ideas and recommendations for people (perhaps yourself or a colleague) to participate. I would also appreciate any consideration by Enron of providing funding for this effort. Thank you Hill Huntington - retail notes.rtf Hillard G.

I will provide a more detailed report but the group completed the process of reviewing the changes that some had suggested to shorten and streamline the NERC electric reliability organization legislation. Sarah and I asked a series of questions and made comments on our key issues and concerns. I want to give you a more complete report once I have gone back over the now final draft version. The timing being imposed by NERC is that they will circulate a clean version of the proposal tomorrow or Monday. They have asked for comments by next Thursday August 16th with an indication of whether each company/organization does or does not sign on to support it. They will then transmit the proposal and the endorsement letter to Congress and the Administration so they have it as Hill and Energy Dept. staff work on electricity drafting issues this month. I pointed out that EPSA is not due to meet internally with its members to discuss these issues until after the NERC deadline. That is not deterring NERC from moving forward with the above time frame.

Let me know what I can do to help. You are correct: this is the way we handle regulatory counsel in other regions particularly the US. What Derrick and I have agreed with regard to counsel selection is: gov't/reg affairs picks the counsel we want to use and he retains a veto which has rarely if ever been exercised. Once we have retained counsel we will use that counsel on other regulatory projects unless the legal department starts to have a problem with the firm (eg because they represent someone against us in litigation). Again I don't recall this ever being an issue. It seems to work: outside counsel gets the message that we will look dimly on any firm that squares off against us and we select the most qualified counsel on our issues. Mark Schroeder@ECT 09/01/2000 06:18 AM To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: 2001 budget You should be receiving today a copy of my draft budget proposed for Enron Europe for 2001. I understand from Nick that they are doing their own budget for Enron Japan which I will see only after the fact. MOST IMPORTANTLY you will see that I am budgetting to pay a substantial sum for legal fees. I will be proposing to John Sherriff Michael Brown (our new COO and former General Counsel which will make my proposal doubly problematic) and to Mark Evans (current General Counsel) that I pay/manage our outside regulatory counsel. We can discuss (rather than do a lengthy e-mail) but having this function managed by Legal (and Houston/Jim Derrick rejecting our choice of counsel in important cases) is increasingly a problem. I believe this will mirror what you do in the USA e.g. Dan Watkiss and hope that I can count on your support for this change. thansk mcs [/INST] Category: Company Business, Strategy, etc.(elaborate in Section 3 [Topics])"

I think it would be interesting to focus your attention on this interplay -- what policy changes have meant to companies (ie the winners and losers) and how explicit companies are about how government policy drives their business strategy in these industries. I also think it would be fascinating to compare regulators' visions for the industry they are restructuring with the reality after the fact. I believe you would find some similarities but also some substantial and interesting differences. Good luck with your studies. My best regards to Mike I learned a great deal working for him.

The order provides for $69 million in potential refunds (either pay up or provide cost justification). Enron was not named as one of the 13 overcharging parties but PGE was ($3.18 million). It's not over yet though. The order deals only with Jan 01 and promises further orders regarding Dec 00 and benchmark prices through April 01. The prices used to determine refunds were fairly high ($273/mwh based on gas prices emissions costs and an assumed heat rate of over 16000). With respect to sales to California we have concluded at least one short term sale and have talked with Cal Dept of Water Resources about longer term deals but we were still struggling with credit issues last I heard.

They request that we be required: to answer their motion on Thursday to provide the information within 5 working days of a FERC ordering production and to provide of P&L information and spread sheets detailing our deals specifically delivery point delivery date counterparty volume and price. We may not have a problem providing this information for use by FERC in its proceeding subject to a confidentiality agreement but I think we would oppose their requests for: the information to be provided for government eyes only - this would prohibit EPMI from defending itself vis-a-vis other market participants. a FERC confidentiality order that would could allow FERC to share this information with the CPUC (for purposes of the PUC's OII proceeding) pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 824h(c). 16 USC 824g(c) requires the Commission to make information available to state commissions as may be of assistance in state regulation of public utilities. We should argue that 16 USC 824h(c) does not apply here given that we are not a public utility nor does the PUC regulate how much market power wholesale marketers exercise or the level of market power mitigation (these are the bases the PUC provides for explaining why it should have this information.) the above contractual information to allow them to analyze the competitiveness of the forward market to evaluate the wisdom of the Commission's decision to allow the UDC's unfettered access to the forwards market. This argument is unpersuasive given that the CPUC can get information about the competitiveness of the forward markets from the Wall Street Journal's listing of NYMEX prices.

Gray Davis faced with the near inevitability of raising consumers' electricity bills is leaning toward a rate system whereby those who use more power pay more than those who conserve The Chronicle has learned. Sources close to the governor said he is being lobbied by his own staff members to accept a so-called structured rate system. Top officials from his own administration told lawmakers Friday that the state may end up spending more than twice the $10 billion previously estimated to purchase power on behalf of California's near-bankrupt utilities. If so the officials warned that consumers' electricity rates could double. In the case of Pacific Gas and Electric Co. this would mean customers' average monthly power bills would rise from $60 to $120. Consumers throughout the Bay Area believe that at least some increase is on the way. We're going to have to bite the bullet and pay the money said Larry Webster a retired Caltrans worker in Redwood City. We might as well admit that electricity is no longer a nickel. It's a dime. If you're going to use it let's pay for it. Steve Maviglio a spokesman for the governor distanced himself yesterday from estimates that rates would double. The figures reported in the press he said were wildly high. The governor still believes he can live within the existing rate structure  Maviglio said. Until we know the results of the negotiations with the utilities you can't conclude anything. The state is negotiating a multibillion-dollar bailout package with PG&E and Southern California Edison Co. to relieve the utilities of about $13 billion in debt. PG&E and Edison have been saying for months that there is no way California can overcome its current energy woes without higher rates. The irony of the Davis administration now saying the same thing was not lost on the two companies. The state is in the exact same position the utilities were in last fall said John Nelson a PG&E spokesman. Either wholesale prices need to come down or retail prices need to go up. The disparity is too large. Statewide blackouts last week drove home the precariousness of California's energy situation to ratepayers -- and may have served as a blessing in disguise for the governor. COST VS. OUTAGES If given a choice between further outages and paying higher rates many consumers said they would accept increases in their power bills. I don't like either choice said Janet Leroux facing the possibility of a gooey mess if the air conditioning goes out at her downtown San Francisco candy store. But I guess I'd go with higher rates. I sure didn't like the blackouts. Publicly the governor has been insisting for weeks that rates will stay within the existing rate structure -- a stealthy way of saying that January's 9 percent increase and an expected 10 percent increase next year will remain in place. But privately he and his staff are discussing additional rate increases that could be spread over as long as 10 years sources said. Utility executives and power generators told The Chronicle last week that a minimum 30 percent rate increase lasting up to a decade is in the cards. For the good of California it's inevitable said Gary Ackerman executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum a Menlo Park energy industry association. Sacramento resident John Hax observed that when temperatures soar in the Central Valley this summer he'd be more than willing to pay a higher price for power if this keeps the air conditioners on. It's like gasoline he said. I don't like paying higher prices for gasoline but that's the price of doing business. Ratepayers draw the line though at any increase topping 10 or 20 percent. If it was 20 percent I'd probably do it said Tracy resident Mark Dougherty. But if it was more like 50 percent I'd rather go with rolling blackouts. I'd rather have blackouts agreed Jenny Soghomonian owner of a shoe- repair shop in San Francisco's Financial District. I don't want to pay rates that are so much higher. NOT EVERY COST PALATABLE This is the tightrope that state officials and industry players now find themselves walking: While consumers may be willing to pay more to avoid blackouts they aren't willing to swallow virtually any cost thrown their way. Yet if rates are not high enough they may not prevent daily blackout threats this summer and beyond. Higher rates are the price signal that it takes for conservation said Tom Higgins senior vice president of Edison International parent company of Southern California Edison. Simply put he meant that most consumers will not aggressively conserve power and thus alleviate shortages unless there is a financial incentive to do so. Rebates proposed by the governor have met with only a lukewarm response requiring critics say too much effort on the part of individual ratepayers. But a sudden spike in monthly power bills almost certainly would prompt widespread conservation measures. It adjusts consumer behavior Higgins said. People want to get their bills back down. RATES' EFFECT ON USAGE He and other industry sources said higher rates are perhaps the only way Californians will achieve the 10 percent conservation goal sought by the governor -- a move seen as vital if blackouts are to be avoided this summer. It's intellectually dishonest to think there's any other way out of this Higgins said. Consumer activists' initial reaction to any talk of a rate increase comes across loud and clear: No no no. No bailout. No rate increases. No secret deals said Harvey Rosenfield head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. We need to get back to a regulated system. Rosenfield is the biggest fly in the governor's ointment. He has threatened to push through a ballot initiative re-regulating California's power market if Davis cannot find a consumer-friendly way out of the current fix. Because of Rosenfield's past success in writing a ballot measure on insurance rebates which delivered about $800 million to consumers his threat is taken seriously in Sacramento. We've paid too much already Rosenfield said. A fair price is what we were promised by deregulation which was a 20 percent rate decrease. However when he was asked whether there was any room to discuss a structured rate increase such as the idea being promoted by the governor's staff Rosenfield toned down his characteristic rhetoric. Big users should pay more he said after a moment's reflection. I'm open to a tiered system but only if it's fair. Rosenfield quickly added that he would have to see how other consumer advocates felt about the matter before agreeing to negotiate such things with Davis. MOVE TOWARD STRUCTURED RATES Clearly though momentum is building toward a system of structured power rates which probably would include increases of varying sizes for consumers. The California Public Utilities Commission is scheduled to address January's 9 percent rate increase on Tuesday. That increase originally was given only a three-month duration but most observers expect it to be renewed for at least another three months if not longer. PUC President Loretta Lynch declined to comment on the likelihood of rates going up but added her voice to those backing a structured system. I am a fan of restructuring rates to exempt conservation she said. People who use a whole lot of power should pay more. The biggest electricity customer in the state is the state itself now that California is purchasing power on behalf of its cash-poor utilities. The state already has spent about $4 billion buying electricity and has yet to determine how the cash will be recouped from consumers. San Francisco resident Rosita Magee accepts that for California to find its energy footing once more rates will probably be heading up. That way you have more convenience and electricity more stability she said. But Magee has come up with another solution one that doesn't involve rate increases and rolling blackouts. She's moving to Texas. Chronicle staff writers Matthew Stannard and Pia Sarkar contributed to this report. / E-mail David Lazarus at dlazarus@sfchronicle.com. 2001 San Francisco Chronicle ?

Lockyer who is inve= stigating whether energy firms have manipulated prices on the wholesale el= ectricity market made the comment in an interview with the Wall Street Jo= urnal that appeared Tuesday. I would love to personally escort [En= ron Corp. Chairman Kenneth] Lay to an 8-by-10 cell that he could share wit= h a tattooed dude who says 'Hi my name is Spike honey'  Lockyer said. = Enron spokesman Mark Palmer called the comment counterproductive rh= etoric that does not merit a response. But other industry repres= entatives denounced the remark as outrageous especially because neither= Lockyer's office nor any investigative panel has filed charges against En= ron or other companies. You'd expect that the state's chief legal c= ounsel would file charges first and make public statements second said G= ary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum an association of energy = producers and traders. We're very disappointed with his choice of words = which don't exactly fit the profile of his office.

What I'm trying to do is let these economic buc= caneers understand that if we catch them they're going to be prosecuted= Lockyer said. Just because they're multimillionaires and run big corpora= tions it doesn't provide them with immunity. The attorney general = is investigating whether power company officials tried to maximize profits= through illegal manipulation of prices on the wholesale energy market. S= everal panels including a state Senate committee and the California Publi= c Utilities Commission are conducting similar probes. On Tuesday L= ockyer announced that three power companies have agreed to turn over docum= ents subpoenaed months ago by his investigators. The attorney general went= to court to obtain the documents after the companies failed to meet a Mar= ch 19 deadline to hand them over. Lockyer said the forthcoming docu= ments would help his office as it sifts through mountains of evidence in s= earch of possible violations of antitrust or unfair business practice laws= .

( October 31 2000 ) Oct. 30--While investigating this summer's stunning spike in electricity prices state authorities have heard stories about a curious phenomenon: On days when the weather is hot batches of power generated in California are sold to other states. A little later in the day similar amounts of power are sold back to California -- but at much higher prices. The question is is it the same power? If so that could be megawatt laundering -- a multi-company conspiracy to evade California's wholesale price cap which covers power generated in California but not power sold into California from elsewhere. Worried that such transactions could be costing consumers millions of dollars several energy specialists raised concerns about megawatt laundering during a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission hearing a month ago in San Diego. And earlier this month state Sen. Steve Peace D-La Mesa -- who helped lead the push to deregulate electricity sales in California -- formally asked the commission to investigate the practice which he termed potentially illegal market coordination. But an unconfirmed news report last week said the federal agency had concluded that generators had not abused the market. And others say concerns about megawatt laundering are exaggerated. Among them is Jan Smutny-Jones executive director of the Independent Energy Producers Association a power-firm trade group and chairman of the Independent System Operator which oversees most of California's power grid. While acknowledging that such laundering is possible Smutny-Jones said there is no evidence it is actually occurring or is widespread. This is one of those things that's turning into an urban legend he said. I don't want to characterize this as a significant problem. Even some critics of the way power is purchased in California concede that most of what has been labeled megawatt laundering probably reflects nothing more sinister than the ability of some entrepreneurs to take advantage of a good deal when they see one. Nonetheless they see evidence that at least some California-produced power is being sold out of and back into the state at a higher price. And they blame that on loopholes in the system that they say ought to be closed because the transactions are helping to drive up the cost of power. The Independent System Operator invites this type of activity said Frank Wolak a Stanford economist who chairs the non-profit corporation's market surveillance committee which has warned of the potential for megawatt laundering in at least two reports this year. The thing that makes all these problems go is the fact that the ISO has said `We'll pay whatever it takes to keep the lights on' and that's screwing consumers big time. In 1998 when the state's energy markets were deregulated it was generally assumed that opening up the sale of electricity to competition would make power less expensive. As a precaution however officials at the Independent System Operator instituted wholesale price caps which they lowered twice this summer to help keep a lid on costs. On July 1 this year they reduced the cap from $750 per megawatt per hour to $500 one megawatt being sufficient power for 1000 homes. Then on Aug. 7 they cut it to $250. Unfortunately things haven't worked out the way officials had hoped. Wholesale prices rose dramatically this year. And while a freeze on retail utility rates has temporarily shielded Pacific Gas & Electric Co. customers from those soaring costs home electricity prices have tripled in San Diego where a similar freeze already has come off. In the process some generators learned that all it takes to get around the state's wholesale price caps is a basic understanding of how the market works. One of the best ways to get top dollar they learned was to hold off selling their electricity until the Independent System Operator issues what is known as an out-of-market call for energy which amounts to an emergency request for electricity. From May through September this year the overall price of power in the state averaged less than $125 per megawatt hour according to authorities. But over the same period power sold in response to out-of-market calls averaged more than $430. During the summer when energy use is at a maximum California typically imports about one-fourth of the power it uses from other states. Since power generated by firms in other states isn't limited by California's price cap those companies generally are in a better position than California firms to make a killing on out-of-market sales. But by cutting a deal with a collaborator in another state energy specialists say California generators also can profit handsomely -- despite the cap. Here's how: Say a California generator has 100 megawatts. Instead of selling it in California where the firm can receive no more than $250 per megawatt hour under the current cap it finds a utility an electricity broker or a corporate affiliate with an equal amount of power in another state such as Arizona. Then -- just before an expected heat wave in California which is likely to result in an out-of-market call for power here -- it convinces the other firm to do a trade. Under the deal the California generator sends its 100 megawatts for one hour to the company in Arizona where there is no price cap and earns $300 or more per megawatt -- for a total of $300000. In return the Arizona firm ships its 100 megawatts for one hour here. Since that power isn't subject to California's cap it earns perhaps $400 per megawatt -- for a total of $400000. Presumably energy specialists say the two firms then split the $100000 difference. The potential profit from such deals is considerable. Generators in and out of California received more than $110 million from out-of-market sales this summer according to the Independent System Operator. But determining if megawatt laundering is really happening how often and who might be benefiting is difficult. One California investigator said authorities first suspected that megawatt laundering was occurring when they noticed that precisely the same amount of power was being sold to another state and then sold back into California minutes later. But other experts said the evidence has rarely been that clear. While hundreds of megawatts is sold into and out of the state on any given day they said the suspicion that firms were conspiring to sell the same power back and forth has stemmed largely from unfounded speculation. One big problem for investigators trying to learn if the system has been abused is that confidentiality rules keep many of the details about these electricity transactions private. Entities like us and others who may be suffering from the consequences of this laundering don't necessarily have the documents to prove it said Gary Stern director of market monitoring for Southern California Edison one of the state's three main utilities. We can only speculate based on things we've heard from others about the practice....It's our hope that's one of the things that's being examined by the various federal and state agencies investigating this summer's extraordinary rise in California power prices. Indeed while some people say megawatt laundering can be substantially limited by ending the practice of paying more than the wholesale cap for out-of-state power others argue that it's just as important to eliminate the secrecy surrounding electricity transactions. I'd like to see more information made public said Jim Bushnell a researcher at the University of California Energy Institute in Berkeley who specializes in analyzing the state's energy markets. There are a lot of rumors circulating around this he said of megawatt laundering and it would help clarify if this is a serious problem. ----- To see more of the San Jose Mercury News or to subscribe to the newspaper go to http://www.sjmercury.com [/INST] Category: Company Business, Strategy, etc.(elaborate in Section 3 [Topics])"

J= effords has never mattered much to Californians. Until now. The Verm= ont senator's widely anticipated decision to abandon his fellow Republican= s and put Democrats in control of the Senate could have big implications f= or California particularly on energy and environmental policy lawmakers = and lobbyists said Wednesday. The change which Jeffords is expected= to announce today could increase political pressure on the Bush adminis= tration to respond more aggressively to California's electricity crisis t= hese insiders said. And it might force the White House to compromise= on key elements of the national energy policy it unveiled last week. In f= act the administration's proposed budget cuts for programs to promote ren= ewable energy were said to be a factor in Jeffords' decision. At th= e very least Senate observers said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) is l= ikely to get the floor vote she has sought on price controls for wholesale= electricity. That doesn't necessarily mean that the administration'= s critics will be able to have everything their way. Even if the Senate ap= proves electricity price caps for example the measure would face stiff o= pposition in the GOP-dominated House--and a likely veto if it made it to t= he president's desk. Still a Democratic majority in the Senate wou= ld give Feinstein and other party members a platform to turn up the politi= cal heat on the administration and congressional Republicans on energy pol= icy. It kicks up the dust groaned one energy industry lobbyist wh= o requested anonymity. Observed Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.): If P= resident Bush's hard-edged conservative approach has in fact caused the ba= lance to shift towards Democrats in the Senate it will have profound impl= ications not just for California but for the environment and our nation's= energy policy. Environmentalists seemed almost giddy as they cont= emplated the possible impact of Jeffords' decision on the policies they ca= re about. All of a sudden they said it seems less likely that oil = exploration will take place in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge that r= ecreational snowmobiles will have free access to Yellowstone National Park=  or that the administration's desire to promote nuclear power will be emb= raced by Congress. On the other hand it seems more probable that C= ongress would approve a new plan for managing a vast swath of the Sierra N= evada to protect the region's oldest trees consider legislation to restri= ct emissions of carbon dioxide from power plants and protect California fr= om a resurgence of offshore oil drilling. It's stunning how broad t= he repercussions are particularly on the environment said Gregory Wetst= one of the Natural Resources Defense Council. We're trying not to count o= ur chickens before they hatch. But it will be easier for us in our battles= at least to keep from moving backwards. For instance Jeffords is= a chief advocate of a bill that would regulate carbon dioxide from power = plants. And if events play out as expected he'll become the new chairman = of the Senate committee with jurisdiction over the issue. Another i= ssue under his purview would be the two-decade dispute over a proposed rep= ository for the nation's spent nuclear fuel at Yucca Mountain in Nevada. = Yucca Mountain is a dead turkey declared Michael Francis of the W= ilderness Society. Environmentalists had been worried that a number= of pro-development provisions would be packed into appropriation bills. B= ut with Democratic senators in charge that would become less of a threat= they said. Every wacko idea Republicans have will get a higher lev= el of scrutiny Francis said. The biggest change would be the power= of Senate Democrats to decide which bills will be considered in committee= s and which ones will make it to the floor of the Senate for votes. = As part of a new Democratic majority Feinstein and fellow California De= mocrat Barbara Boxer are likely to gain leverage with the administration o= n a number of issues considered important to the state. That transl= ates into more federal assistance for California across the board predic= ted Steve Maviglio spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis. I think it mean= s more attention to our state for sure Boxer said. Right now the pres= ident doesn't seem to give a darn. They're all looking at California as a = Democratic state. They're not interested. Feinstein who has been = unable to arrange a meeting with Bush to discuss the energy crisis may ge= t better treatment if winning Democratic support becomes more important to= the administration. She has been regarded as a bridge-builder who worked = effectively with Republicans in the past. This has not been a warm = and friendly administration she complained Wednesday. They've got peopl= e who know all the answers and don't want to listen. The White Hou= se disputed that. In fact Bush agreed Wednesday to meet with Davis during= the president's first visit to California next week. Under a Democ= ratic majority Feinstein would be in line to chair two subcommittees: the= military construction panel of the Senate Appropriations Committee and t= he technology terrorism and government information subcommittee of the Se= nate Judiciary Committee. Boxer would be in line to chair the subco= mmittee on Superfund waste control and risk assessment and the Foreign R= elations subcommittee on international operations and terrorism. Mav= iglio predicted that the effects of Jeffords' expected party defection wou= ld be felt immediately. The chairmanship of the Senate Energy and N= atural Resources Committee would be taken away from Frank H. Murkowski (R-= Alaska) who has been openly hostile to California's plight and handed = to Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.) who supports Davis' request for electricity pri= ce controls according to Maviglio. Democrats have assailed Bush's e= nergy plan for tilting heavily toward the supply side. With Democrats in c= harge of the Senate the administration would be more likely to compromise=  perhaps beefing up funding for Democrat-supported causes such as increas= ed energy assistance to low-income households and more aggressive promotio= n of conservation and renewable energy sources such as wind and solar powe= r.

The letter is attached way at the bottom of this e-mail and was received in several Enron European offices as a copy of what was sent to Jeff Skilling and other CEOs of major companies. I have not confirmed our receipt of such a letter from any of you but am assuming it was delivered. I think we could respond in a very positive constructive manner to Greenpeace based on the statements we've already documented and the strategies we are developing. Lisa Jacobson and I are currently working on developing some tighter climate change and clean air messages that we can use in multiple areas ASAP -- upcoming Ken Lay speeches and interactions with the Administration revising the Statement for the 2001 Corporate Responsibility Report Enron Business articles and other internal uses responses to environmental group inquiries and shareholder meeting Q&A and use in everyday speeches and advocacy work. The Greenpeace questions are tricky and set up no-win answers for the most part. I doubt they will get any direct answers to questions like: Does your company support President Bush in his opposition to the protocol? In my opinion we can respond to Greenpeace without directly responding to these types of questions. Addressing Kyoto directly is a slippery slope -- its best to stick with the solution-oriented approach we've always taken. For this reason I was a bit concerned to see in the e-mail chain below a characterization of Mark Palmer's statement on Kyoto (given to Jackie Gentile in London) -- Enron has always taken the view that the Kyoto protocol was not a workable solution to dealing with CO2 emissions. However it is not the principles behind Kyoto that we take issue with rather it is the vehicle that has been devised to deliver the results. I believe it is dangerous to make such statements for a number of reasons -- Greenpeace would absolutely beat us over the head with it Friends of the Earth could step up its shareholder initiatives etc. Also this sets you up for a number of follow up questions that I don't think we have answers to like: What about Kyoto is not workable? What would make it workable and would we help make it workable? If not Kyoto what is Enron's preferred vehicle? I'd really rather stay with a constructive solution-oriented approach and avoid reference to Kyoto altogether. I will talk with Kate Bauer in Enron Europe about this but I think we need to decide on a global corporate-wide response to Greenpeace. I would be happy to set up a quick conference call on the subject or just field comments by e-mail -- whatever works best. Thoughts?

Media Action: In addition to doing behind the scenes editorial board meetings and the like I would suggest that we get our coalition lined up and ready to release statements for certain key events which are likely to occur over the next several weeks such as: 1. SDG&E's selection of the winning bid to their RFP. Even if Enron isn't selected as the winning bid the coalition should trumpet the market-based solution and the enormous market response to SDG&E's RFP. 2. The Commission vote on UCAN's Emergency Motion. We should be prepared to issue a statement whether the Cmmn votes with us or against us. With us the market can and did provide reasonable expedient solutions to SDG&E's customers and protection from price spikes. Against us despite the overwhelming market response the Cmmn chose to ignore the market solutions and impose more regulation. 3. Potential for ARM members to surface a Provider of Last Resort proposal within the next couple of weeks. 4. ISO Bd. Mtg-keep up pressure against reducing price caps. Coalition Members: Agree that those groups listed should be contacted although the CMA CRA CIU CLECA have been luke-warm in their advocacy. I would add our customers (UC/CSU (especially the San Diego branch) PacTel etc.) NewEnergy has indicated that Kroger/Ralph's grocery stores San Diego-based would give testimonials. I could solicit the members of ARM to identify a key customer contacts for interviews. We could check with our lobbyists and see who they would recommend (wine growers dairy industry etc.) We should also consider the water agencies and the rural counties and the City of Pittsburg. While the immediate message is responding to San Diego's situation this latter group of potential coalition members would go to the larger message (keeping benefits of competitive markets) from a state-wide perspective. What about the City of Pittsburg?

Waxman and then recessed the committee subject to the call of the chair following the Memorial Day Week Recess. Congress will not return until the week of June 4 but staff level discussions will likely occur after the three-day weekend. Chairman Tauzin said that the committee is receiving conflicting information on the facts in California. He said it is better to take a little longer to get the facts straight and evaluate various options rather than act quickly but in the wrong way. He did say he expects that the committee will come to a bipartisan agreement after the recess. Behind the scenes we hear that Democrats appear not to want to reach an agreement instead preferring to keep the issue alive. Republicans on the other hand want to spare their vulnerable West Coast Members another recorded vote against price caps. Thankfully following our collective efforts yesterday the discussion has moved off of the 80/20 long term contract requirement. Republicans are poised to offer the Ose bill as an alternative for discussion and amendment if an agreement is not reached. The Ose bill would extend FERC's pricing formula to 24/7 and throughout the West. Staff report that Members were far from agreement and that no one concept was embraced for further refinement. It does appear however that some Members such as Rep. Mary Bono (R-CA) are pushing for some type of price mitigation that they can vote for. With Republicans increasingly worried about the political impact of the energy issue we will need to continue our work next Tuesday starting with an in-depth analysis of the Ose bill.

Mime-Version: 1.0 Content-Type: text/plain charset=us-ascii Content-Disposition: inline IS TRADING AN INSIDER'S GAME? Buying selling of electricity is a growth business but some say deck is stacked against consumers By Craig D. Rose STAFF WRITER June 6 2001 While Californians decry deregulation's failure to deliver a competitive market electricity wholesalers have quietly developed a vast and rapidly growing business of buying and selling power among themselves. The deals take place on high-tech trading floors in Houston and elsewhere around the country as well as on Internet-based trading systems. Some experts say this electricity trading is a key mechanism for raising consumer power prices yet it's largely unregulated. Electricity trading is like buying stock -- when you have ability to change the stock price said Frank Wolak a Stanford University economics professor and member of the state grid operator's market surveillance group. Energy companies say the buying and selling of contracts to deliver power provides risk management allowing plant owners to presell their electricity lock in prices and avoid fluctuations. The rough and tumble of the free market they add is the most efficient means of allocating a resource like electricity. But industry critics say trading is far from a competitive market paradigm. In their view it's a means of communication -- a way for energy insiders to collude and raise prices under the guise of competition. To be sure the trading arms of major energy companies have emerged as stars in an industry where profit surges of 300 percent or 400 percent are not uncommon. The transactions shrouded in secrecy can leave ownership of a critical commodity in unknown hands. Consider the case of power generated by AES Corp.'s California plants. In 1998 AES made a bold move. Immediately after purchasing power plants that gave it control of 10 percent of the state's electric generating capacity the company sold the output from its plants for the next 20 years to Williams Cos. Williams did not sit on this treasure trove of electrons. The Tulsa Okla. company soon sold 80 percent of what it bought. It is difficult to say who owns that power now. Some might be owned by Sempra Trading a sister company of SDG&E. Or some could be owned by Enron Corp. the nation's biggest electricity trader. A spokeswoman for Williams conceded that Williams itself may have repurchased some of the electricity it sold earlier. But trading companies closely guard their positions. This much can be said with certainty: Electricity that AES sold for less than 5 cents per kilowatt-hour to Williams changed hands perhaps 10 times in the wholesale market and emerged at times in recent months with a price tag for consumers that was 300 percent higher. Williams' trading profits increased by 523 percent in the first quarter this year. Advance sales All this buying and selling creates curious confluences. In their attempt to deflect criticism over high prices generating companies such as Duke Energy -- operator of the South Bay Power Plant in Chula and others in the state -- frequently note that they sell most of their electricity far in advance. But they acknowledge less often that their trading units may also be buying power which could boost the company's electricity inventory. Duke was the fourth biggest electricity trader last year and cited its trading activity as a prime contributor to its wholesale business profits which soared 324 percent in the first quarter to $348 million. It is a company's power traders who frequently direct plant operators to increase or decrease the generation of power in response to market conditions. Energy companies have little option but to turn to trading for profits. One of the better kept secrets of electrical deregulation and its promise of competition is that there is remarkably little competition in the production side of the business. For one thing electricity is a commodity power from one company is indistinguishable from that generated by others. More important nearly all modern plants generate power from turbines built by a handful of manufacturers. The result? Modern plants owned by different companies produce power at nearly identical cost. The cost of power produced by modern plants is all within a mil (one-thousandth of a dollar) said Michael Peevey an adviser to Gov. Gray Davis and former president of Southern California Edison. So the extraction of profit in the electricity business relies much more on trading. Traders' profits rise when prices are volatile -- plunging or even better rising sharply. Little regulation But despite the obvious temptation to manipulate the market the burgeoning electricity trading business has remained largely unregulated. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission does require quarterly filings from energy traders but these often provide incomplete information or at least little that has been of concern to FERC. In fact although the trading of electricity grew more than a hundredfold from 1996 to 2000 FERC has taken no major enforcement action against a trader. After the onset of the California crisis last year FERC has acted once. That was against Williams which agreed to pay $8 million without admitting guilt to resolve an allegation that it withheld supply to pump up prices. FERC's record of enforcement in the area of power trading stands in contrast to a long list of enforcement actions within other markets taken by the Securities Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. FERC has recently added staff to its market oversight operations. But William Massey a FERC commissioner says the agency's effort is still inadequate. Electricity can be flipped stripped and chopped up Massey said. It's an extraordinarily complicated market. The sophisticated marketers and traders have simply moved past us. We're kind of horse and buggy in our approach and they're out there in rocket ships flying around ... The problem is that sophisticated traders don't necessarily produce reasonable prices. They produce profits. Before deregulation electricity trading was a low-key affair. Regulated utilities dealt power back and forth on a reciprocal basis to fill electricity shortfalls in their control areas. There was little trading for profit until the mid-1990s after federal legislation and FERC rulings opened the market. Major traders include large energy companies sister companies of California's major utilities and Wall Street firms. Market volatility In many ways the trading of power is similar to that of other commodities. But there are important differences. Because it cannot be stored and its use is so fundamental the price of electricity is the most volatile of all. When supplies are tight a single supplier can rapidly raise prices to budget-busting levels as evidenced by Duke Energy's recent admission that it charged California nearly $4000 for a megawatt-hour of power a quantity that probably sold hours earlier for one-tenth of that sum or less. Wolak the Stanford economist and state Sen. Joseph Dunn D-Garden Grove who is investigating the state power market say trading allows companies to collude under the guise of competition. Instead of wringing out lowest costs the wholesale trading market serves to raise prices they say. As I trade to you and you trade to me we communicate to each other what price we would like to get said Wolak. It's not collusive. It's just communicating price. Mark Palmer a spokesman for Enron the nation's biggest power trader said California's problem is not the result of trading. It's a result of shortages Palmer said. Underscoring its emphasis on trading Enron's new headquarters tower in downtown Houston rises from a six-story block of new trading floors including expanded space for electricity trading. Enron also pioneered trading in cyberspace and its Enron Online site claims to be the most active computer-based trading market. The Houston company argues that consumers won't fully benefit from power trading and deregulation until they have greater choice in choosing their power supplier. And the company says FERC has not done enough to open access to transmission lines which would allow traders to move power around the country. To that end Enron has lobbied hard for President Bush's plan for a national electricity grid. Palmer says the notion that the price of electricity rises each time it is traded is mistaken. The market is always looking for the real price of a commodity Palmer said. Dunn the California state senator says his investigation found a different function for trading. At a time when supply barely meets or falls short of demand he noted companies with electricity to sell have to worry only about how high to set their price. The trader is a pawn in the generator's game to drive up prices said Dunn. Trading develops a level of trust. You my alleged competitor will bid in the same patterns and I will respond not in a competitive pattern but in a complimentary pattern. The state senator said his investigation found evidence that on several days energy companies appeared to test their ability to drive prices up without being undercut by competitors. This ability to drive up prices without competitive consequence is a key test of market power the technical term for manipulation or price fixing. But Dunn also conceded that antitrust violations can be hard to prove in court. He suggested that even if the trading behavior falls short of antitrust violations it remains anti-competitive and devastating for the California economy. To Harry Trebing a utility industry expert and professor emeritus at Michigan State University wholesale electricity trading is reminiscent of what took place in the 1920s and early '30s. Back then utility companies created complex networks of holding companies that traded stock among themselves driving up prices in the process. Undoing that scheme was a focus of President Franklin Roosevelt's administration. Congress ended up barring national power companies and tightening regulation of utilities in an effort to counteract their tendency to create markets that work only for insiders. The broad goals of trading are the same Trebing said. The goal is to maximize profits through raising prices. [/INST] Category: Company Business, Strategy, etc.(elaborate in Section 3 [Topics])"

Some might be owned by Sempra Trading a sister company of SDG&E. Or some could be owned by Enron Corp. the nation's biggest electricity trader. A spokeswoman for Williams conceded that Williams itself may have repurchased some of the electricity it sold earlier. But trading companies closely guard their positions. This much can be said with certainty: Electricity that AES sold for less than 5 cents per kilowatt-hour to Williams changed hands perhaps 10 times in the wholesale market and emerged at times in recent months with a price tag for consumers that was 300 percent higher. Williams' trading profits increased by 523 percent in the first quarter this year. Advance sales All this buying and selling creates curious confluences. In their attempt to deflect criticism over high prices generating companies such as Duke Energy -- operator of the South Bay Power Plant in Chula and others in the state -- frequently note that they sell most of their electricity far in advance. But they acknowledge less often that their trading units may also be buying power which could boost the company's electricity inventory. Duke was the fourth biggest electricity trader last year and cited its trading activity as a prime contributor to its wholesale business profits which soared 324 percent in the first quarter to $348 million. It is a company's power traders who frequently direct plant operators to increase or decrease the generation of power in response to market conditions. Energy companies have little option but to turn to trading for profits. One of the better kept secrets of electrical deregulation and its promise of competition is that there is remarkably little competition in the production side of the business. For one thing electricity is a commodity power from one company is indistinguishable from that generated by others. More important nearly all modern plants generate power from turbines built by a handful of manufacturers. The result? Modern plants owned by different companies produce power at nearly identical cost. The cost of power produced by modern plants is all within a mil (one-thousandth of a dollar) said Michael Peevey an adviser to Gov. Gray Davis and former president of Southern California Edison. So the extraction of profit in the electricity business relies much more on trading. Traders' profits rise when prices are volatile -- plunging or even better rising sharply. Little regulation But despite the obvious temptation to manipulate the market the burgeoning electricity trading business has remained largely unregulated. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission does require quarterly filings from energy traders but these often provide incomplete information or at least little that has been of concern to FERC. In fact although the trading of electricity grew more than a hundredfold from 1996 to 2000 FERC has taken no major enforcement action against a trader. After the onset of the California crisis last year FERC has acted once. That was against Williams which agreed to pay $8 million without admitting guilt to resolve an allegation that it withheld supply to pump up prices. FERC's record of enforcement in the area of power trading stands in contrast to a long list of enforcement actions within other markets taken by the Securities Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. FERC has recently added staff to its market oversight operations. But William Massey a FERC commissioner says the agency's effort is still inadequate. Electricity can be flipped stripped and chopped up Massey said. It's an extraordinarily complicated market. The sophisticated marketers and traders have simply moved past us. We're kind of horse and buggy in our approach and they're out there in rocket ships flying around ... The problem is that sophisticated traders don't necessarily produce reasonable prices. They produce profits. Before deregulation electricity trading was a low-key affair. Regulated utilities dealt power back and forth on a reciprocal basis to fill electricity shortfalls in their control areas. There was little trading for profit until the mid-1990s after federal legislation and FERC rulings opened the market. Major traders include large energy companies sister companies of California's major utilities and Wall Street firms. Market volatility In many ways the trading of power is similar to that of other commodities. But there are important differences. Because it cannot be stored and its use is so fundamental the price of electricity is the most volatile of all. When supplies are tight a single supplier can rapidly raise prices to budget-busting levels as evidenced by Duke Energy's recent admission that it charged California nearly $4000 for a megawatt-hour of power a quantity that probably sold hours earlier for one-tenth of that sum or less. Wolak the Stanford economist and state Sen. Joseph Dunn D-Garden Grove who is investigating the state power market say trading allows companies to collude under the guise of competition. Instead of wringing out lowest costs the wholesale trading market serves to raise prices they say. As I trade to you and you trade to me we communicate to each other what price we would like to get said Wolak. It's not collusive. It's just communicating price. Mark Palmer a spokesman for Enron the nation's biggest power trader said California's problem is not the result of trading. It's a result of shortages Palmer said. Underscoring its emphasis on trading Enron's new headquarters tower in downtown Houston rises from a six-story block of new trading floors including expanded space for electricity trading. Enron also pioneered trading in cyberspace and its Enron Online site claims to be the most active computer-based trading market. The Houston company argues that consumers won't fully benefit from power trading and deregulation until they have greater choice in choosing their power supplier. And the company says FERC has not done enough to open access to transmission lines which would allow traders to move power around the country. To that end Enron has lobbied hard for President Bush's plan for a national electricity grid. Palmer says the notion that the price of electricity rises each time it is traded is mistaken. The market is always looking for the real price of a commodity Palmer said. Dunn the California state senator says his investigation found a different function for trading. At a time when supply barely meets or falls short of demand he noted companies with electricity to sell have to worry only about how high to set their price. The trader is a pawn in the generator's game to drive up prices said Dunn. Trading develops a level of trust. You my alleged competitor will bid in the same patterns and I will respond not in a competitive pattern but in a complimentary pattern. The state senator said his investigation found evidence that on several days energy companies appeared to test their ability to drive prices up without being undercut by competitors. This ability to drive up prices without competitive consequence is a key test of market power the technical term for manipulation or price fixing. But Dunn also conceded that antitrust violations can be hard to prove in court. He suggested that even if the trading behavior falls short of antitrust violations it remains anti-competitive and devastating for the California economy. To Harry Trebing a utility industry expert and professor emeritus at Michigan State University wholesale electricity trading is reminiscent of what took place in the 1920s and early '30s. Back then utility companies created complex networks of holding companies that traded stock among themselves driving up prices in the process. Undoing that scheme was a focus of President Franklin Roosevelt's administration. Congress ended up barring national power companies and tightening regulation of utilities in an effort to counteract their tendency to create markets that work only for insiders. The broad goals of trading are the same Trebing said. The goal is to maximize profits through raising prices. [/INST] Category: Company Business, Strategy, etc.(elaborate in Section 3 [Topics])"

It is an update of the July 2000 report done at the request of House Energy Chairman Tauzin and Subcommittee Chairman Barton. They requested the report be updated. A summary of the report and the full 80+ page text is on the FTC web site at www.ftc.gov on the upper left side of the home page. I read the summary and will read the balance. So far so good. It basically says that even states that have opened up to retail competition are in transition with a hybrid of regulation and competition thus the expected benefits of competition have not yet emerged. However the report states that nothing to date indicates that competition once the transition period is over will not produce additional benefits for consumers. The report's major conclusion is that competitive wholesale markets are important to achieving effective competition in retail markets. The summary includes something that sounds promising on RTO policy saying And as wholesale and retail markets become regional governing policies and jurisdictional approaches also must move in that direction for wholesale and retail competition to be successful.

It is not clear to me which variable represents hourly ISO imbalance energy costs but I assume its Est RT$. If I am right that variable would be affected by the mitigated market price (MMP) for CAISO imbalance energy. My comments are: The FERC is able to only order refunds to jurisdictional entities and given appeals it may take years before the full extent of thre refunds are known. Therefore there will be a significant difference between the change in the mitigated market price (MMP) as declared by FERC and the PX credit. That is a 10% reduction in the MMP should not be construed as having a 10% effect on the PX credit assuming it can be recalculated at all. Specifically only some of the HC or Est RT$ costs can be adjusted per FERC refund orders. Also the PX credit is a tariffed rate. I do not believe the PU code allows for retroactive adjustments to tariffed rates unless there was an explicit cost tracking account (e.g. a balancing A/C). To my knowledge no such account exists here. Finally I do not see a relationship between MMPs and (1) block forward costs on any date and (2) PG&E and/or DWR's procurement costs for the net short position post January 19. So those PX credit costs should be unaffected by any FERC refund order. Alan Comnes  [/INST] Category: Company Business, Strategy, etc.(elaborate in Section 3 [Topics])"

That recipe should be out of the PUC=01s oven sometime next week. =01&Well the power marketers are jigging the system bidding up to the ISO=01s bid cap. There is no way you can tell me that a generator planned to make $750/MWH in its pro forma=018 Dave added. =01&So you agree with Herr (Hair) Peace! You don=01t believe in markets=018 I retorted. = =01&Oh I believe in them but I remember when I was short on a 300 MW trade and without any notice or advanced warning the price in the Midwest market went against me=018 Dave recalled. =01&I called everyone who I tra= ded with and they had nothing. I finally called XXXXX and I asked what will it cost for 50 MW?=018 =01&Why didn=01t you ask for 300?=018 I wondered. =01&I didn=01t want to= show him my position. You get hosed when you show the buyer your position. Ask for 50 first=018 Dave chided. =01&What happened?=018 =01&Oh they offered to sell for $150/MWH. I said I= =01d take it and then said I needed another fifty. He asked $300. I took that and he priced the next 50 MW at $600=018 lamented Dave. =01&He just wanted to see how far he could push me. That=01s what I mean when I say the traders are jigging it.=018 =01&But Dave you old communist your forgetting the trading function is what mitigates the risk. The traders are the in between people who guess at the price. Sometimes they guess right and sometimes they guess wrong. But the damage or the reward is on their book not passed on to the ultimate consumer. It has nothing to do with the marginal cost of a generating plant.=018 And there you have it. Put in a price cap and the traders have a target for which to shoot. I can=01t prove the following yet but I=01l= l wager with any of you that as the price cap level dips down the average trading price climbs even as the so-called =01&dysfunctional=018 price spik= es are eliminated. Consumers get hosed and the fundamental economic principle is upheld which is one can never be made better off with the imposition of an additional constraint. I feel better already. Here is what is on our short agenda this week. >>> Things in the Mailbag >>> Things in the People=01s Republic of California @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings @@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market >>> Odds & Ends (_!_) >>> Things in the Mailbag It has been awhile since we put the mail feedbag on and had a munch. Here is what my friends have been writing me. FPL Energy=01s Steve Ponder was only too quick to tell me =01&Please Gary=  no more whining about your computer. How old are you?? Is this the year you get the AARP letter??? A very depressing moment. Do you really not know how to spell Morro Bay??? Please let us know what is going on with your son's hockey team?? Don't forget the cigars for Moron??? Bay!!!!=018 It is good to have friends like Steve. They make the pain of separation so much easier. And Steve when you FPL guys get that Entergy merger sorted out in a dozen years or so you let us know. I want to participate in the name selection for the new entity. How about Fentergy PLus? Next from the PX=01s Mark Hoppe who writes =01&As you've heard from others I don't know quite how you manage to knock out all this material each week. The burrito is informative humorous and usually contains a sprinkle of irony tragedy (ISO Drama). Though you are usually neutral regarding the PX you are not unduly negative which I appreciate. I think we do a pretty good job over here and so often people in the industry forget the amount effort and challenge it took the PX to successfully open this market.=018 Thanks Mark. I just want you to know that my ability to write this stuff every week is not constrained by the facts or evidence. I have learned from watching Herr (Hair?) Peace that as long as you can talk (write too) fast and have conviction in your statements regardless of how groundless they may be you will have a willing and eager audience. A few weeks ago I received from the PX=01s Jennifer Sherwood a note which she wants you to know are her opinions not necessarily the PX=01s. It=01s okay Jennifer. I paid Georgeyesterday the $20 I owed him for that sham Rose Bowl bet (remember? Stanford lost) and your opinions are cool with us. =01&Just curious - has anyone been comparing high unleaded prices to high CA electricity prices? What I mean is we are up in arms about how we should protect the unfortunate San Diego consumer who can't afford to keep the AC on. But what about the inflated unleaded gas prices the whole country has seen over the last few months? No effort is made by the government to shield the consumer from how much it costs to fill their gas tank. No mention is made of those who can't afford to drive to the grocery store because they can't afford the extra 15 or 20 cents a gallon. The costs are passed along to the consumer without pause. Granted there are differences between the unleaded market and the electricity market in terms of demand-side responsiveness but then again is it that much different to say =01+I can't drive today because gas is too expensive=01 vs. =01+I can't turn up the AC today because it's too expensive.=01=018 Finally from one of our [secret] Washington readers and I am not telling who I received the following: =01&I ... broke down and listened to the [ISO Governing Board] discussion and vote. Ugh! I too noted that the speak fast was applied to everyone but Herr Peace. My goodness what a mess we have. I loved Jerry's picture in USA Today -- it spoke volumes. My sources at FERC tell me though that we should keep an eye out for {FERC Chairman] Hoecker to do something really ... [Censored] ... for political reasons. Given no Commission meetings til September the only way to act is by unanimous consent so I would hope he can't do all that much.=018 >>> Things in the People=01s Republic of California @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report Several of you people commented to me that the ISO=01s reply to the PUC/EOB report was very good. I decided to excerpt the best sections of it for the Burrito. The full document can be found on the ISO=01s website. =01&... the [PUC/EOB] Report asserts that the suspected activities of certain generators on June 13 created frequency instability leading to the Bay Area blackouts the following day. In fact the events of June 13 and June 14 were completely independent of one another. The voltage instability on June 14 was caused by system conditions on that day alone -- exceptionally high loads insufficient generation in the specific local area and transmission constraints that prevented the import of generation from outside the area. =01&The Report states that the ISO =01&never tried=018 to call upon consume= rs to reduce demand in order to avoid the Bay Area blackouts. In fact the ISO had in place on June 14 a number of demand response programs designed to reduce load including the Summer 2000 Demand Response Program under which customers have agreed through a prior solicitation to curtail energy use in exchange for a fee =01&The Report makes a number of assertions concerning the prices paid by =01+purchasers=01 of energy as a result of the recent price spikes (e.g. $= 1.2 billion in the month of June alone). These assertions leave one with the mistaken impression that these prices reflect amounts actually paid by the UDCs and/or passed through to customers. However in determining the total cost of energy one must determine the impact of any forward contracts entered into by the UDCs in advance of the wholesale energy markets. These contracts which are designed to =01&lock-in=018 a specific price in advance of real-time or near real-time market activities are specifically designed to mitigate the impact of price volatility and are standard in all commodities markets. We have reason to believe that some of the UDCs were substantially hedged during the period of the recent price spikes. =01&In a similar vein the reports asserts that California =01&might well= =018 have saved $110 million dollars had a $250 price cap been in place in May and June. This assertion assumes that all energy purchases would have been made at or below the $250 bid cap. In fact during times of peak demand when all of the state=01s generation has been exhausted the ISO competes with neighboring regions for available generation. In order to secure the necessary power the ISO must purchase on a bilateral basis this energy from resources located outside of the ISO=01s control area. =01&The Report asserts that California power markets =01&are not now competitive=018 and implies erroneously in our view that this is the normal state of affairs. It is not. The Market Surveillance Committee has noted that =01&market power in the California energy market appears to arise primarily during periods of peak demand=018 and warned that demand growth would increase the incidence of market power during the summer of 2000. =01&The Report asserts that the ISO is answerable only to a self-interested board and not to the citizens of California. This simply is not the case. The ISO is subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act and to the rules and regulations of FERC which dictate in part that wholesale energy rates must be just and reasonable and in the public interest. The ISO further operates under a detailed tariff reviewed and approved by FERC. Every change to our market design and virtually every aspect of the ISO=01s business is subject to review and scrutiny by FERC. The FERC process provides substantial opportunities for input by the state agencies and such agencies have in fact been active participants in the FERC proceedings. =01&The Report asserts that California supply conditions have been affected by restructuring and that somehow the restructuring choices have made California more vulnerable to supply shortages. This assertion is unfounded. Significant load growth in California and neighboring states coupled with a lack of significant infrastructure investment in both generation and transmission have caused this vulnerability. Restructuring has increased proposed power plant applications many fold. Only by immediate and sustained attention to streamlining approval and siting processes for both of these critical infrastructure elements will this significant shortage be addressed.=018 >>> Things in the People=01s Republic of California @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings If you want to imagine a scary sight imagine then twelve California legislators gathering together in one hearing room to rectify the wrongs of electric restructuring. Also imagine as if you are in the Twilight Zone witnesses that are slow on their feet and reckless in their facts. Then you get a glimpse of what yesterday=01s Joint Senate/Assembly hearing was like. It started over two hours late. The Senate was busy congratulating one of their own who is term-limited out next session and they wanted to heap on the glory. That said the show began with CEC Commissioner Bill Keese. Mr. Keese has one story and regardless how well he tells it and he does it is always the same story. It is the heat storm story. One can imagine in the heat storm story a lead character who is a single-mom call her Lady-Bird Bowen who travels across an angry land with her precocious pre-teen child Stevie Wonderboy. They are searching for electric power plants in the dessert which by the grace of God have been shipped to other countries which have more liberal returns on investment. Being the first speaker Mr. Keese took at least half the heat (storm) of the day. The rage of the Energy Fuhrer was palpable. Last week San Diegans shed 350 MW of load last week to save the entire system and did not receive one penny of compensation (I=01m not making that up ... He said it). He is sick of hearing about demand management as being a solution for the problem over the last five years and he is about done listening. People in San Diego are depressed by the sudden price hikes. Yikes! Keese did mention that the California reserve margin has sunk to 7% but in neighboring Arizona the reserve margin is -1% or -2%!! Mr. Keese correctly pointed out that electric power is not solely a California problem it is a regional problem. One member of the Committee asked what the legislature could do to speed up the power plant siting and construction process? Keese referred to Governor Gray Davis=01 Executive Order issued last week to which the CEC plans to respond soon date uncertain that lays out a 6 month permitting time line. The six months are enough if the applicant has the land secured zoning okayed transmission access and air offsets. Hmmmmmm. That alone might take six months before you get to the CEC. The next panel included Mr. Kahn of the EOB and Ms. Lynch. I went too hard on her last week calling her Let=01s Do Lynch. That was a 0.8 TPC. Sorry. I promise to be nicer starting now. The Energy Fuhrer instructed Ms. Lynch to use her authority to order SDG&E to divert the pass through of funds from the customers to the PX until the dysfunction of the market is cured. Put it in an escrow account. Ms Lynch promised to review this option at her August 21 PUC Meeting where she will enact SDG&E rate caps (told you). The star of the day I thought was FERC General Counsel Doug Smith. Mr. Smith comes to Sacramento. Isn=01t that a switch? Mr. Smith came in place of Mr. Hoecker thank the Lord. Mr. Smith put into FERC-eese what these 12 legislators could not get through their heads any other way. The 12 angry legislators were looking for a way for FERC to declare the wholesale market as non-competitive and then ask the generators to give back the money they over collected. When can we do that? Mr. Smith answered as only a FERC attorney can answer. There is a process. It takes time. You must have evidence. FERC uses a three-part criteria for assessing whether or not market based rates are allowable. It=01s based on market concentration and dominance not the existence of high prices. You would have to sue FERC in federal court and the best you could hope for is for FERC to reconsider its decision upon remand from the US Court of Appeals. Slowly the wind came out of the sails of the gang of 12. They were stumped. Herr (Hair?) Peace screamed couldn=01t you Mr. Smith of FERC today use your authority to declare the markets non-competitive that generators who had market based rates have exercised market power and retro-actively implement a $250 rate cap across the Western region? Like a wheezing accordion Mr. Smith played back and forth the familiar strains of music like a solo street musician on the corner. Back and forth: the process the process the process. There have been times in the past I hated the process at FERC. Today I have a renewed respect for what process affords me and you ... Freedom from the tyranny of a mob. For the remainder of the hearing they focused on remedies that could be undertaken by the PUC. >>> Things in the People=01s Republic of California @@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market Well the official title is =01&Order Instituting Investigation into the Functioning of the Wholesale Electric Market and Associated Impact on Retail Electric Rates in the Services Territory of San Diego Gas & Electric Company=018. I like my title better. This Order or OII was issued at the last business meeting of the Commission on August 3. It calls for an investigation of the wholesale markets responses from the three UDCs and a pre-hearing conference in San Diego on August 29 at the San Diego Convention Center. Here are the questions the PUC wishes us to address: =01=07 What bill payment options should be provided to assist residential a= nd small commercial customers? (What does this have to do with the functioning of the wholesale market?) =01=07 Should SDG&E be authorized to participate in bilateral contracts or other supply procurement activities? How should the Commission assess reasonableness? Are SDG&E=01s purchasing activities serving its customers on just and reasonable terms? =01=07 What is SDG&E=01s obligation to minimize energy costs for its curre= nt customers? =01=07 How should the Commission Attorney General EOB ISO and PX coordinate to investigate wholesale market events behaviors and irregularities? How should state/federal concerns be addressed? =01=07 What are the causes of the price increases? Are anticompeititve practices causing some of the price increases? Are there mechanisms the Commission can employ to make ratepayers whole? >>> Odds & Ends (_!_) As promised last week I have a message from our event coordinator Barb Ennis regarding the upcoming WPTF General Meeting on October 5 and 6.

The object of humor notwithstanding and seeing how the flow of new material has slowed a bit my wife provided this week=01s laughter. She didn=01t have to attend the Senate hearing. Subject: The Brilliance of Women There were 11 people hanging onto a rope that came down from a helicopter. Ten were men and one was a woman. They all decided that one person should get off because if they didn't the rope would break and everyone would die. No one could decide who should go so finally the Woman gave a really touching speech saying how she would give up her life to save the others because women were used to giving up things for their husbands and children and giving in to men.

I just wanted to warn you that I'm not sure this is in Enron's long-term interest at all. Let me explain why. Feel free to give me a call if you'd like to talk more about this. First let me say that I firmly believe in locational pricing and specifically pricing congestion. However the way that PJM implements nodal pricing is to eliminate as much price volatility and reduce the transparency of the market. Specifically the PJM tariff gives the ISO the ability to mitigate to cost plus a %10 adder the bids of any market participant that the ISO deems is out of merit in one of the three zones in region. (The fact that a nodal market is talking about zones should give you cause for alarm.) Then the ISO takes this mitigated bid and re-runs its price-setting software to compute new nodal prices. The way I have (somewhat unfairly) decribed this price-setting process is that the PJM ISO decides what prices it would like for a given day and mitigates bids until it gets them. This is not a transparent market nor one where it makes any sense to buy the risk management services that Enron provides. The only price volatility you have to worry about in the PJM market is that kind that comes about if they need imports into their control area to meet demand. Under these circumstances you need to pay the imports whatever is necessary to get them to come to your market. However bear in mind FERC's desire to make a large RTO on the East Coast. This will effectively mean little imports to the East Coast RTO so all bids can be mitigated at the discretion of the ISO. Paying market-clearing prices to cost-of-service mitigated bids is just paying too much to eliminate price volatility. It effectively kills off the development of risk management at the wholesale and retail level. Power marketing becomes much less profitable because retailers know you can always buy at cost-mitigated prices. In short the PJM model is not market. It is just an alternative form of regulation that is politically attractive because it reduces price volatility but it is not good for consumers or traders because they just get a higher cost form of regulation than traditional cost-of-service regulation. You pay market-clearing prices to cost-of-service mitigated bids but under regulation you could just pay cost-of-service prices and eliminate the infra-marginal profits to low cost generators. As we discussed during our dinner I think the two biggest sources of benefits from re-structuring will come from getting the demand-side involved in the market and from more efficient risk management. A necessary condition for both of these to occur is prices that reflect actual conditions in the market (including the extent of market power exercised). Masking these signals dulls any incentive for market participants to make the investment necessary to management. The PJM model is just way to have a market in name without achieving any significant benefits to consumers or energy traders.

Here is what happened on the three amendments of interest to Enron: 1. The House overwhelmingly defeated (154 to 274) a Waxman Amendment (D-CA) to impose cost of service rates on wholesale sales of electricity in the WSCC for 18 months. Only three House Republicans supported the amendment (all from California -- Gallegly Issa and Hunter) 57 Democrats opposed the Waxman Amendment including all of the Texas Democrats EXCEPT Frost Hinojosa Rodriguez and Doggett (these four SUPPORTED the Waxman Amendment). Thus our collective lobbying efforts in recent months focusing on California Republicans Texas Democrats and other moderate Democrats worked out in the end. 2. The House also overwhelmingly defeated the Cox Amendment (R-CA) to grant California a waiver of the Clean Air Act's oxygenate requirement for reformulated gasoline. The vote was 125 to 300 (44 Republicans 80 Democrats and 1 independent voted for the amendment 173 Republicans 126 Democrats and 1 independent) voted against it. 3. The House also defeated the Green Amendment (D-TX) to repeal the Natural Gas Act's Hinshaw Exemption as it applies to California's intrastate natural gas pipelines. The vote was 154 to 275 (123 Republicans and 31 Democrats voted for it while 95 Republicans 178 Democrats and 2 independents voted against the amendment). Please call or e-mail with comments or questions. The Senate Energy Committee is starting its work this week on an energy package with consideration of an R&D title (other issues will be taken up in September including electricity). The House Energy and Commerce Committee will now turn to electricity issues with staff drafting during the August Recess hearings in September and votes on legislation in September or early October.

The conclusion is that while we continue to need to address the kinds of issues laid out in your recommnedations we need to look at solutions which may go deeper to adress our communications problems .. . solutions which have become available only recently.

I think you and your team have done a fine job dealing with the traditional (and perhaps largely insoluble problems) that this group wants to take on. I am pessimistic that the program outlined below will provide anything other than marginal improvements. I am somewhat optimistic though that we may be able to bypass many of these problems (and get to the heart of what people are really complaining about in the survey) by instituting real knowledge management at Enron.

In a nutshell our strategy seems to have worked and we've won all the concessions we sought. As you'll recall these were: a) to get the BLM to withdraw any interim policies the first of which split fiber cables into 144 different ROW certifications and a later version that re-packaged the issue mandating that ROW certificates be issued each time a fiber owner subleases or sells capacity on its line with a retroactivity clause that added extra sting b) to get the Forest Service to retract its May 2nd memorandum which changed its fiber optic ROW policy from published fee schedules to individual comparable assessments (the first such assessment which compared ROW fees in urban centers in downtown Portland and Seattle to Oregon forest lands increased the cost of a segment of our FTV fiber build 150 fold) c) to block both agencies from implementing any proposed or final rule in FY 2001 and d) to create an open rule making process that involves all interested stakeholders including Enron. Thanks to the considerable pressure we orchestrated from Congress and the Administration BLM Director Fry and USFS Chief Dombeck have backed away from points a and b above and have agreed to points c and d. The language we inserted in the Interior Appropriations Bill which has been agreed to by the Conferees forces both agencies to revert back to the published fee schedules prevents them from implementing any new policies in FY 2001 and forces them to work with industry and to come up with a common policy for future rent determination. The reference in the opening sentence to gravitationally-challenged women is because the issue still hasn't quite closed. The Interior Appropriations Bill may very well be vetoed. But since our issue was settled at the staff level and is now off the table we're likely to remain safe from being re-examined and challenged. In fact any changes would likely only increase the strength of our hand: some members of our coalition are trying to insert even more detailed language in the report that prescribes exactly how the agencies will proceed to determine the new rental fee schedules over the next 18 months. Through outside consultants we've had a series of constructive discussions with the agencies over the past two weeks that have forged agreements on timing and specific ways forward. Details are forthcoming but Enron would be involved closely in the process. The agencies were clearly surprised by the clout we wielded and are now more than willing to negotiate. But the bottom line again is that we have stopped both agencies from implementing their costly interim policies or launching a rule making process either now (which they originally intended to do) or in the coming fiscal year. And by engaging key Members of Congress and the White House and organizing and leading the 20-member Fiber Optic Public Land Right-of-Way Coalition we've succeeded in branding Enron as a leader in the communications field.

One attorney from CPUC but on phone. Barbara Barkovich attended for CA Large Consumers. Nader sent someone. No other consumers. One other ESP -- Strategic Energy (only operates in San Diego). Judge reports that only 6 offers have been submitted to FERC for sales to the IOUs (note Enron submitted one of the offers). The offers total 2000 MW. The prices are quite divergent. He expresses concern at the little offered. Generators suggest that more could be offered if FERC could be more flexible on terms (FERC required 24/7 offers). IOUs and others press judge to seek offers from others not present (e.g. BPA other marketers SW utilities) but judge does not offer to do so. Barkovich says can't throw large customers into non-core market now. Everyone agrees that we are all looking for a blended wholesale rate (part existing gen part OFs part forward contract and part spot) that meshes with the IOUs' ability to recover the costs in rates -- so tied to CPUC rate increase. Discussion of CPUC PD -- not enough Enron able to take low profile. SDG&E suggested terminating the settlement talks at FERC saying nothing could be achieved. Not much happens until 4:30 pm when judge blows up -- judge directed epithets at SDG&E and SCE. SCE had refused to cooperate from the beginning. Out of the Room Separate talks between PG&E and SDG&E and some of the generators. Late in the day Judge meets with IOUs. Parties agree informally that forum does not work well given lack of CPUC involvement but some believe that FERC is only hope for a workable resolution. Next Steps -- The Judge Speaks Judge asked everyone to consider how to Share the Pain for Thursday's meeting and said not to expect any win:win scenario. His view is that FERC is better than the CA legislature or bankruptcy court. His focus will be on Wolak proposal to share the pain as submitted in 12/1/00 comments to FERC -- forces all sellers to CA to sell most of its supply (either generation or marketer offers) as cost-based rates in forward contracts or lose ability to sell at market-based rates. Generators oppose this I believe. Enron planning to continue low profile but to discuss options with ENA. [/INST] Category: Company Business, Strategy, etc.(elaborate in Section 3 [Topics])"

I still think it's important for our security people to be able to recognize all of our senior executives and make sure their guests get where they are going quickly. To: Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES cc: Susan Skarness/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Follow-up Steve - Following up on our conversation Friday we have advised Cliff Baxter's Assistant that effective immediately Cliff and his quests can pass through Security on the Plaza without showing his access card or requiring his quests to sign in or identify themselves. All he needs to do is approach the front Reception Desks and asking for entry. The receptionists will recognise Cliff by sight and ensure that he and his quests pass through - without delay - by lifting the adjacent rope. We are asking Cliff to use his badge at the card readers as per standard procedure when he is entering the building by himself. We are also refining procedures and upgrading our IT systems/data base @ the Reception Desk to make it easier on a visitor of any employee. For example if you call down to the Plaza Reception Desk and advise that a visitor is expected the receptionist will have a pass prepared so as to eliminate the sign in process. The guest simply has to exchange their business card for the visitor pass. Or if an employee shows their access card at the Reception Desk and asks that their guest gain entry that guest can get a badge without signing in. Again we ask that the guest exchange their business card for a visitor pass. We are working on installing a new data base @ the Desk that will pull up a digitised photo of the employee (duplicate of what's on their badge) on the screen. This will allow employees to get a temporary access badge without showing other ID and will speed process. Finally we are testing a small proximity access card which is designed to be a duplicate back-up for executives. It is sized to fit on a key chain and works with our standard card readers. - Bill [/INST] Category: Logistic Arrangements(meeting scheduling, technical support, etc)"

Just wondering what it means to possibly add a provision which I understand is a may -- dealing with FERC's authority to change existing RTOs. Depending on what that means it could seriously hamstring FERC's efforts for a 4-5 RTO model as sought and we support by not letting FERC change existing RTOs (particularly if that includes pending but not approved) to change. For example would the language under consideration block a Northeast RTO of PJM NY and NE since PJM is existing and NY has filed? What would be the rationale for such a serious limitation on FERC's authority? Thanks.  [/INST] Category: Company Business, Strategy, etc.(elaborate in Section 3 [Topics])"

In the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee we will be facing efforts by pro-price caps forces who will use the committee bully pulpit to pressure FERC into more action. This effort is led by incoming chairman Bingaman with support from Majority Leader Daschle. They are saying they will consider acting on the Feinstein-Smith price cap legislation unless FERC takes unspecified additional action by the end of this month. The new track in the Senate will be in the Governmental Affairs Committee chaired by Sen. Lieberman (D-CT). While this committee does not have the legislative jurisdiction over energy that the Energy Committee does in terms of moving legislation the Governmental Affairs Committee has broad oversight and investigatory jurisdiction over all federal agencies including FERC. New chairman Lieberman held his first press conference as chairman today and said addressing high energy prices would be a priority. In that vein the committee is expected to hold a hearing on June 13 featuring some of the economists who wrote a letter in favor of price caps last month. We are checking with the Republican staff to make sure that the anti-price cap economists (the majority of the discipline of course) will also testify. We also brief committee members and staff with our arguments against price caps and the latest publicly available market data. On June 20 the committee will hold a hearing on whether FERC has properly exercised its duties under the Federal Power Act to make sure that wholesale power rates are just and reasonable. We are going to meet with the committee majority staff but we presently expect this hearing to have political witnesses (i.e. elected officials possibly including Gov. Davis). We must keep in mind that Sen. Feinstein had earlier written to Chairman Lieberman asking for a hearing on the California energy situation including relationships between FERC and those it regulates (citing the NY Times article involving Enron and Chairman Hebert). There is at present no indicationi that either hearing will address this matter. We are as you might imagine paying close attention to this situation. Over in the House Energy and Commerce Chairman Tauzin has said he will write to FERC asking them to extend the April 26 price mitigation order to the entire west and to extend it to 24/7. He also asks FERC to see if it can implement negawatts demand reduction administratively. We are in the process of obtaining a copy of the letter which has not yet been made public. Also in the House we expect congressional committees to begin marking up portions of the President's energy legislation and related topics as the month unfolds.

Here is the state of play. There are two interrelated tracks at present: the DeLay et al negotiations of all stakeholders (which I attended and participated in today but did not concern reliability) and the NERC process that is underway to consider how to bring those such as Enron that are not on board with the so-called consensus NERC language (Sarah participated in the Tuesday meeting on this issue where PJM put a proposal on the table that Sarah advises largely tracks our draft this process will continue next week and a follow up meeting the week after). The interrelationship is that it is likely that IF (a big IF) there is an electric title that is added to the congressional bill that will start moving in the House subcommittee next week the NERC version will be included as a place holder with the understanding that if the NERC discussion process yields a different result it will be substituted. Furthermore those who oppose the NERC version would be free to continue opposing it on the Hill and elsewhere. So you might say there is a rebuttable presumption of sorts in favor of the NERC version (which is shorter than the old NERC version) because so many groups favor it but those who oppose it such as ourselves continue to seek allies for a shorter streamlined version. Congress is far from approving any final version. [/INST] Category: Company Business, Strategy, etc.(elaborate in Section 3 [Topics])"

There are three projects which have significant cash flow problems and thus= difficulties in meeting debt obligations: these are: SECLP Panama and Gaz= a. In the past as I suppose we have done in Dabhol we have taken the pos= ition that we would not inject cash into these companies and would be prepa= red to face a default and possible acceleration of the loans. SECLP has be= en the biggest issue/problem. Panama is much less (a few million of floati= ng of our receivables from the company) would be sufficient to meet the cas= h crunch in April of this year. Note that in Panama the debt is fully gu= aranteed by the government and is non-recoursed to the operating company B= LM. In the past we have discussed letting the debt default which would c= ause the bank to potentially seek complete payment and acceleration from th= e GoPanama. The reason: the vast majority of BLM's problems stem from acti= ons taken by the regulator that have effectively amended our PPA's with pri= vate parties those actions resulted in significant loss of revenues which= although today have stopped or have been limited have left a mark on th= e company's liquidity position. =20 Now the question is: come April of 2002 should any of our actions in Panam= a or decisions related thereto (which we would have otherwise taken or made= ) be affected in any way by either the proposed merger or an effort by Enro= n to preserve efforts to re-establish investor/creditor confidence? The sa= me could go for SECLP and Gaza. This is simply an overall guidance question. Let's take it up during our= staff meeting next week if that's ok with you.

I'm testifying at the Congressional hearing and Dasovich is covering FERC. I think Jeff's comments were taken out of context. He said policymakers do need to take care of small customers whose bills are tripling. Frankly we'd get slaughtered if we said anything else. But he also said there is a right way and a wrong way to do it. Enron and others had provided a market based answer by offering a fixed price deal to SDG&E (which would have enabled them to cap rates to those who had not switched. California elected instead to cap rates and deficit spend (ie create a deferral account). I don't think we can stand for anything that doesn't protect the small customers but we can continue to emphasize the market based solutions. One of the messages in my testimony will be: customers should be encouraged to choose. Those who did are doing fine.

It was apparently released on the CAISO site on 6/21. Note that the $9billion includes bilateral trade sold to any party. However Hildebrandt cannot say who the supplier is unless DWR CAISO or the PX was the buyer (for those buyers he presumably has detailed data). Thus he can ascribe overcharges to specific jurisdictional generators for only $5.4 billion of the $9billion total. He does not show what specific parties are attrributable to the $5.4 billion. In an earlier study on just ISO R/T strategic bidding supplier names were released inadvertantly by CAISO. Finally as in previous CAISO studies a significant fraction of overcharges (approx $3 billion) comes from before the refund-effective date of 10/1/00.

Enron's Skilling gets pied before his speech blaming lawmakers but says he understands Californians' anger By Rick Jurgens TIMES STAFF WRITER SAN FRANCISCO -- A Texas energy executive who said his warnings were ignored by regulators who restructured California's electricity industry came to the Bay Area on Thursday to say in effect I told you so. Jeffrey Skilling chief executive of Houston-based Enron Corp. said that California wouldn't be in its current mess if regulators had followed his advice in 1994 and 1995. Regulators erred by forcing wholesale electricity transactions into the spot market so that deals could more easily be monitored Skilling said in a speech to about 100 people at the Commonwealth Club of California. They created a flawed marketplace in the name of regulatory expediency. Enron is a broker that buys and sells contracts to deliver power. Such bilateral transactions shouldn't have been banned Skilling said. Skilling said that's what he said six years ago. I probably made a pest of myself (in the restructuring hearings called by regulators) because I told them they were doing it wrong he said. They finally told me to keep quiet. On Thursday night it was Skilling's turn to be pestered. A woman threw a chocolate pie into his face before the event began. Police said Francine Cavanaugh of Oakland was arrested on suspicion of battery and released. Skilling tried to ignore protesters but said he understood why Californians facing blackouts and rising power costs were angry. He even had kind words for Gov. Gray Davis who he said was dealt a very difficult hand. Skilling became Enron's chief executive in February replacing company founder Kenneth Lay an early proponent of electricity deregulation who is close to President Bush. Enron a global energy giant with roots in the natural gas industry owns some power plants but its influence in the electricity industry reflects the rapid growth of its energy trading operation. Enron's only California generators are small wind facilities. However the company has developed power plants. Enron initiated two 750-megawatt projects that were sold to Calpine Corp. including a Pittsburg plant due to go online next month. Enron has announced plans to seek regulators' approval for a 750-megawatt power plant in Roseville in Placer County. During the first three months of 2001 Enron posted a huge jump in revenue to $50.1 billion from $13.1 billion a year ago but a much smaller gain in net income to $425 million from $338 million. Skilling himself cashed an $850000 paycheck and got a $5.6 million bonus last year. But the energy crisis has taken its toll on Enron's stock price and on Skilling who owned or held options to buy 1.9 million shares of Enron common stock at the time of the company's February proxy filing. At Thursday's closing price of $44.05 a share the stock was down more than 50 percent from its 52-week high of $90.75 in August. That proved that Enron wasn't the villain in California Skilling said. This thing in California has been bad for everybody he said. If we had anything to do with this we're the stupidest people in the world.

You lead the story which also includes Governor Davis President Bush. What most catches my attention are the visuals and chant of the protestors during the Enron segment. The props and signs are very TV camera friendly. For instance there is a larger then life mask of you and a mockup of a paycheck to you from the people of California. The chant rhymes with your name. From my perspective this was no simple pie in the face. This protest was very organized and sophisticated. I think it would be prudent to gain more information about who was behind it and who was behind them. I tried sending you the video file in mpeg format but at 8400k it was too large to email.

A couple of comments for your consideration: On page three we describe the change to the definition of Public Utility and then argue that we don't fit into it. Would it be worth explaining why that makes sense? Specifically the New Jersey restructuring law like most efforts of its kind in other markets is designed to separate the competitive from monopoly elements of the power (and gas) businesses. Economic regulation would then be restricted to the remaining monopoly elements of the business (eg distribution). The competitive market can not be solely relied upon to regulate the behavior of monopoly asset owners such as distribution utilities. Therefore regulators continue to be called upon to set pricing and other terms of service. What those regulators decide matters a great deal to those monopoly utilities and it consequently makes sense for lawmakers to be concerned about attempts by such entities to use campaign contributions to tacitly influence decision makers. The same public policies simply do not apply to that portion of the market which is competitive. The generation and sales business has a competitive structure (i.e. relatively low barriers to entry multiple competitors etc.). These components of the power and gas business can be regulated by the market with respect to rates and terms of service. They do not require economic regulation any more than grocery stores department stores appliance sellers or other retailers (who presumably are not prohibited from making contributions. Competition and markets discipline behavior and establish competitive prices and terms of service. Because regulators don't set the prices and terms of service for such sellers there is no reason to be concerned about campaign contribuitions from such organizations. Indeed the legislation and the legislative history clearly conform to this underlying policy rationale. As a former practicing lawyer I certainly understand the value of pleading in the alternative. But I question how certain of our arguments woud be perceived by the public if they ever came to light (which these documents have a habit of doing).. . I can just see the press seizing on Enron's claim of ignorance or mistake or the fact that we pled for the favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion. I suggest that we add whatever we feel is necessary to the very solid looking intent argument not make specific reference to ignorance or mistake and not plead for the favorable esxercise of PD. If we feel we need to write about this last item perhaps we could suggest that it would be a waste of the public's resources to pursue a claim under such circumstances.

More utilities have been approaching TNPC EES and ENA about taking over their merchant functions. On the policy side we are working the issue on both a state and federal level. Whether this country does anything meaningful to deal with the current crisis comes donw to one person ... Linda Breathitt. Ken Lay spoke with Secy Richardson and Sen Schumer about proposing rulemaking initiatives to FERC. We are working the RTO process hard elsewhere in the country and coming up with messages to arm our remaining allies around the country. THis is the biggest time for us on this issue since the very beginnings in California and New Hampshire. In the current panic however we will be decimated if we are associated only with a move to keep price caps from going into effect (I saw your message to Mona). I am going to read the comments next but I start off thinking we need to avoid running headlong into the price cap movement we may be better off trying to co-opt the movement to get broader reform.

The Real Wolf RECKONINGS By PAUL KRUGMAN ecently I received a letter from an economist I respect chiding me for my Naderite columns on the California energy crisis. He just didn't believe that market manipulation by power companies could possibly be an important issue it sounded too much to him like the sort of thing one hears from knee-jerk leftists who blame greedy capitalists for every problem be it third-world poverty or high apartment rents. The left has cried Wolf! so many times that sensible people have learned to discount such claims. But now a bona fide wolf has arrived whose predatory behavior is doing terrible damage to our most populous state =01* and nobody will believe it. True California would be heading for a summer of power shortages even if it had never deregulated. And even if there was workable competition in the wholesale electricity market prices in that market would spike during periods of peak demand transferring billions of dollars from either taxpayers or consumers to the generators. But the evidence is now overwhelming that there isn't workable competition in California's power market and that the actions of generators gaming the system have greatly magnified the crisis. The key fact is that California has somehow remained in a state of more or less continuous power shortage and very high wholesale prices regardless of the level of demand. A rash of outages has kept the electricity market conveniently =01* and very profitably =01* short of supply even during periods of low demand when there ought to be lots of excess capacity. As Frank Wolak the Stanford economist who also advises the state's power grid has pointed out an outage at a power plant is a lot like an employee calling in sick. You can't tell directly whether he is really sick or has chosen to take the day off for other reasons but you can look for circumstantial evidence. And such evidence has convinced Mr. Wolak that generators use forced outages strategically to withhold capacity from the market =01* a view shared by a growing number of other researchers. Which brings us to the latest move by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. On Wednesday the commission apparently decided to offer California some relief and put new price caps in place on the California electricity market. I say apparently because the more you look at the plan the less likely it seems to be any help at all. Indeed the measure was passed on a 2-to-1 vote with William Massey =01* the one commissioner who has been sympathetic to calls for price controls =01* voting against it on the grounds that it would be ineffectual. What's wrong with FERC's plan? First it caps prices only in emergency conditions =01* ignoring the fact that electricity prices have stayed at hard- to-explain levels even when there is no emergency. In effect the plan is laid out as if the electricity market were really competitive in spite of all the evidence that it is not. Second even those emergency price caps are full of loopholes offering extensive opportunities for what Mr. Wolak calls megawatt laundering =01* selling power to affiliated companies that for one reason or another are exempted from the price controls (for example the controls do not apply to imports from neighboring states) then selling it back into the California market. Severin Borenstein of the University of California Energy Institute adds that because the allowed price depends on the cost of generation at the least efficient plant generators will have a clear incentive to produce inefficiently: I predict we will find some plants we never heard of before that are suddenly operating again and they will be pretty inefficient. The general verdict seems to be that this is not a serious plan. There are serious proposals to mitigate the crisis out there =01* indeed last fall Mr. Wolak submitted a proposal that was well received by other experts =01* but FERC has ignored all of them. The charitable interpretation is that FERC still doesn't get it that it just can't bring itself to believe that this time the wolf is real. The uncharitable interpretation is that last week's action was meant to fail. The Medley Report an online newsletter calls the FERC plan a grand exercise in posturing without substance . . . a very clever temporary move by the Bush administration to deflect any political fallout from the looming disaster. Whatever the explanation the plain fact is that FERC and the administration have yet to offer California any significant relief. &en=3D6a9 00f004b3b1abf Visit NYTimes.com for complete access to the most authoritative news coverage on the Web updated throughout the day.

SAN FRANCISCO Feb 2 (Reuters) - California Gov. Gray Davis on Friday blocked the California Power Exchange from liquidating stranded energy contracts held by cash-strapped utility Southern California Edison seizing the assets for the state. The governor's office said the order issued late on Thursday and put in effect on Friday was needed to preserve the contracts' value for power-starved California consumers. I am using my emergency powers to seize options to buy very inexpensive power that would otherwise be lost forever Davis said in a statement. These options will provide reliable power through the end of the year. It is important to protect these contracts for the people of California he said. A Los Angeles judge on January 24 issued a temporary injunction valid for a week blocking the exchange's sale of the contracts. The California Power Exchange (CalPX) said Davis' order nullified a Los Angeles County Superior Court decision earlier Friday that authorized CalPX to liquidate Edison's forward market positions. The exchange said they had sought to liquidate the contracts to recover about $255 million that Edison has failed to pay to CalPX market participants. While agreeing to transfer the contracts to the state the exchange pointed out that the law requires that California pay a reasonable value for them which it estimated at nearly $652 million on today's market. Delivery of the first contracts which total 2.8 million megawatt hours is scheduled to begin Monday February 5. One megawatt hour is roughly the amount of electricity needed to light 1000 homes for 60 minutes. Davis is desperately seeking cheap power for the state after the utilities' financial meltdown pushed them to the market's sidelines. Spot market purchases for the state are currently being made by the Department of Water Resources but at typically higher prices than in the forwards market. Block forward energy contracts secure electricity deliveries over a given block of time at a price agreed months in advance shielding the buyer from the kind of price volatility that has recently roiled the short-term spot market. The overall value of SoCal Edison's contracts agreed last year for power to be delivered in 2001 was not immediately known but CalPX officials said last month they hoped their liquidation would cover the $215 million SoCalEdison owned the exchange. SoCal Edison the utility subsidiary of Rosemead Calif.-based Edison International has warned it is no longer able to meet its financial obligations after running up a debt of nearly $5 billion buying wholesale power in the spot market where prices have soared ten-fold over the past few months amid a regional energy shortage. The utility is blocked by the state's 1996 deregulation law from passing these high wholesale prices down to consumers who are still protected by a rate freeze. That same deregulation legislation created the CalPX making it the state-sanctioned exchange for electricity trading. SoCal Edison was among the biggest buyers on the exchange. CalPX crushed by a mountain of debt it is unable to recover from Edison has shut its spot market operations and is winding down its business affairs. Copyright  2000 Dow Jones & Company Inc.

I'm not sure we can convince Massey and others not to cap the secondary market for example but they need to understand the facts before they run off attacking the pipelines: gas utilities in California opposed interstate capacity expansions into the state. gas utilities had just as much opportunity as anyone else to participate in open seasons for capacity. gas utilities fialed to fill storage. gas utilites have failed to build adequate take away capacity at the Cal border I suspect Socal gas is using its interstate capacity and its in state storage to line its own pockets. In short if FERC wants to get to the bottom of the problem they need to look in California not outside. Ray Alvarez 05/04/2001 09:02 AM To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: House and Senate Energy Hearings Today on California/Western Electric Situation Steve I've been thinking about the intense preoccupation with gas prices lately and decided to pass this info along because I think it's a red flag. My concern is that there might not only be a backlash affecting our interstate pipelines but that our gas marketing efforts might be adversely affected. It might well be found that the holders of the firm capacity (i.e. marketers?) and not the pipes themselves are at fault for the large basis differentials between the basins and the CA delivery points. Whoever is blamed might not really matter. My gut feeling is that the other shoe is about to drop with calls for price caps on gas commodity prices into the West. This of course could affect years of effort on the gas marketing side in establishing competitive markets. Pipeline open access is of no avail if there is government intervention in the gas markets. Commissioner Massey Senator Feinstein and other Western Senators were saying some very concerning things about gas prices the impacts in their states and that something needed to be done. FERC responded with an announcement of their technical conference on interstate pipeline capacity and intrastate take away capacity (which by the way doesn't appear to address storage). Everyone wants an explanation as to why the basis differential is much higher than in other states since they thought it should only consist of transport costs.

Thanks for putting this together. Dale/Patrick - lets regroup on how we want to move this onward. Seems like SJ's suggestion of our spending more time with Bill Dwyer is a good one. Thanks Matt Sarah-Joy Hunter@ENRON 12/12/00 02:42 PM To: Matt Harris/Enron Communications@Enron Communications cc: Patrick Tucker/Enron Communications@Enron Communications Peter Goebel/NA/Enron@Enron Dale Clark/Enron Communications@Enron Communications Jennifer Medcalf/NA/Enron@Enron Subject: HP -- confidential internal document Matt: As GSS Business Development transitions the HP relationship for broadband to your team there are several issues I wanted to clarify in terms of how the relationship has been developed and who the contacts have been to date. Additionally I outlined the discussion points/action items from this morning's meeting you held with Jennifer Medcalf and myself. Per your request the HP presentation complete with a listing of HP's business partners was e-mailed to you this morning. HP contacts to date: Bill Lovejoy Western Gulf Area Sales Manager Houston TX #(713)-439-5587 (Gerry Cashiola's boss) Gerry Cashiola sales representative Houston TX #(713)-439-5555 (To date HP person coordinating the relationship--seeking a short term play) Greg Pyle Solution Control Manager Southeast Region Austin TX (#(512)-257-5735 (Pyle has been playing the business developer role but continues to defer leadership of the process to Gerry Cashiola) Daniel Morgridge Manager of Internet - E-Services long term alliances Austin TX #(512)-257-5736 (Interested in E-services/wireless longer term alliances) Bill Dwyer Chief Architect e-Services Solutions Cupertino CA #(408)-447-5240 (To date clearly the most knowledgeable person on HP's business propositions strong technical financial background to craft value propositions. Gerry Cashiola and Greg Pyle deferred to his judgement in the 11/16th meeting) Matt On November 10th GSS Business Development took HP through a tour of Enron's trading floor the gas control center and the peaking power plant unit center on the trading floor. This tour was one meeting amongst several held in October and November to provide HP a full overview of Enron's products and services and introduce them to appropriate contacts at Enron (EBS GSS buy side -- Peter Goebel). On November 16th GSS Business Development Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark outlined 3 possible EBS/HP focus areas -- connectivity storage and wireless. Three EBS action items were defined in that meeting: 1) HP was to provide an HP contact on connectivity (to date Gerry Cashiola has stalled on providing this). Sarah-Joy will continue to pursue this information and get a sense from Gerry Cashiola of what he means by short term opportunity. What is HP's time horizon for short term? 2) EBS and GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call on Storage with Ravi to explore size and potential scope of opportunity (completed 12/8) 3) GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call with Peter Goebel GSS IT Sourcing Portfolio Leader (set for 12/14) In conversations with you Jennifer Medcalf and myself this morning several decisions on forward-looking strategy with HP/EBS were confirmed: Gerry Cashiola has been unable to take control of the process. More importantly despite numerous visits to Enron in which he has had overviews of Enron's products and services met with Peter Goebel and his team on the GSS buy side and participated in an Experience Enron tour Gerry has been unable to define an HP business proposition. The coordination between Cashiola (short term initiative) Morgridge (long term 12-24 months) has remained unorganized. These initiatives need to be developed separately. Clearly the conversations with HP need to be elevated to a more senior level so EBS can work with HP decision makers who can move the relationship forward at a strategic level. As the relationship is developed at this strategic level shorter term opportunities will crop up along the way. But Gerry's short term plans will not be the focus of the EBS/HP relationship rather a by-product. To facilitate this process of elevating the relationship Jennifer Medcalf and I are following up with Bill Lovejoy and Greg Pyle. Lovejoy's boss is Dan Sytsma VP of HP's America's Central Region. In the conference call Thursday 12/14 with Peter Goebel and HP regarding wireless initiatives Peter will support the GSS/BD push for the HP/EBS initiative by reiterating the following two points: a) Enron is already an HP customer the onus is on HP to move forward on the process of building a strategic relationship (IBM and Lexmark are only some of the HP competitors who could push them out of the running) b) HP's ability to bring the right people to the table will influence HP's business relationship process with Enron Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark could build their relationship with Bill Dwyer Chief Architect e-Services Solutions (met at the meeting 11/16) in the near term. Perhaps plan a visit to Cupertino California to see Dwyer in person. We look forward to continuing close collaboration with your team on this and other opportunities.

Media Action: In addition to doing behind the scenes editorial board meetings and the like I would suggest that we get our coalition lined up and ready to release statements for certain key events which are likely to occur over the next several weeks such as: 1. SDG&E's selection of the winning bid to their RFP. Even if Enron isn't selected as the winning bid the coalition should trumpet the market-based solution and the enormous market response to SDG&E's RFP. 2. The Commission vote on UCAN's Emergency Motion. We should be prepared to issue a statement whether the Cmmn votes with us or against us. With us the market can and did provide reasonable expedient solutions to SDG&E's customers and protection from price spikes. Against us despite the overwhelming market response the Cmmn chose to ignore the market solutions and impose more regulation. 3. Potential for ARM members to surface a Provider of Last Resort proposal within the next couple of weeks. 4. ISO Bd. Mtg-keep up pressure against reducing price caps. Coalition Members: Agree that those groups listed should be contacted although the CMA CRA CIU CLECA have been luke-warm in their advocacy. I would add our customers (UC/CSU (especially the San Diego branch) PacTel etc.) NewEnergy has indicated that Kroger/Ralph's grocery stores San Diego-based would give testimonials. I could solicit the members of ARM to identify a key customer contacts for interviews. We could check with our lobbyists and see who they would recommend (wine growers dairy industry etc.) We should also consider the water agencies and the rural counties and the City of Pittsburg. While the immediate message is responding to San Diego's situation this latter group of potential coalition members would go to the larger message (keeping benefits of competitive markets) from a state-wide perspective. What about the City of Pittsburg?

We were one of the early parties pointing out the problems with total reliance on the spot market and encouraging more forward contracting. Given the utilities' precarious financial position there were two options: 1) outsource the default provider obligation to the market (this is what we prefer but there was no political support for it) or 2) have the state put its credit behind the purchases. California is pursuing the latter with CDWR prucahsing the utilities' requirements. In the short term we have criticized the state's plan because it contemplates state takeover of the grid state participation in power plant financing construction and ownership and they have not made it clear that CDWR really has the money to pay for all the purchases. I am attaching text I have used as the base for a number of communications with policymakers.

The bonus language contained in the majority of the agreements with a target bonus is as follows: Provided that Enron meets its earnings targets and provided that Employee is rated within the top 25% of the performance criteria under Enron's annual performance rating system or its equivalent for the calendar year in question Employee's annual bonus amounts under the Plan for calendar years 2001 2002 and 2003 (payable in 2002 2003 and 2004 respectively) shall be based on an annual bonus target of $_____________. This language does not address a person's performance as compared to one's peers but instead looks at the number of performance criteria and requires that a person be in the top 25% of those criteria. Thus if there are only 3 rating categories (i.e. 1 2 3 distributed as 10-80-10) then only the people in the top category would be within the top 25/33% of the rating criteria. Given the huge change in our process however there is an argument that the above language cannot be applied to the current scheme and that instead we should look at the top 25% of the peer group instead of performance criteria even though that was not the intent of the provision when it was drafted. As a result I would suggest that the middle category be divided further into either 2 or 3 subcategories (i.e. 2A 2B or 2C). That way persons who fall out in categories 1 or 2A would be eligible for the target bonus. If there is a decision not to break down the middle 80 further then it would be useful to look at those employees with a bonus target that we think is too high. For those employees a more conservative approach may be to evaluate them on a scale that is more subdivided than the 10-80-10 breakdown and to document that they fell out in the bottom 75% of the categories under that process. Of course it goes without saying that we should ensure consistent treatment based on race sex national origin age etc. in this process. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Berkeley POWER (Program on Workable Energy Regulation) Conference on March 16. Here is a brief report on the relevant parts. Notably the Lieff Cabreser duo of Bill Bernstein and Barry Himmelstein were there listening carefully. The program consisted of the presentation of 8 economic studies followed by comments from two discussants followed by audience questions/comments. The following is a list of the papers and the discussants who presented with slides taken from the website of the U.C. Energy Institute You can click on this to see the slides in PDF format. The papers in green are not particularly relevant for our purposes and I won't say more about them beyond the note in brackets. The presenter's name is in bold. Bidding Asymmetries in Multi-Unit Auctions: Implications of Bid Function Equilibria in the British Spot Market for Electricity by Greg Crawford Duke University Joe Crespo NERA and Helen Tauchen University of North Carolina Pricing and Firm Conduct in California's Deregulated Electricity Market by Steve Puller UC Berkeley Discussion by Anjali Sheffrin California Independent System Operator Identification and Estimation of Cost Functions Using Observed Bid Data: An Application to Electricity Markets by Frank Wolak Stanford University [A paper about economic tools to study power markets.] Forward Contracts and the Curse of Market Power by Jeffrey Lien  University of Maryland The Impact of Retail Rate Deregulation on Electricity Consumption in San Diego by James Bushnell and Erin Mansur UC Berkeley [This looks at whether consumption declined with price increases. Not much.] Consumption and Home Energy Costs: How Prevalent is the 'Heat or Eat' Decision? by Julie Berry Cullen University of Michigan Leora Friedberg University of Virginia and Catherin Wolfram UC Berkeley [A macro study on how consumers change overall spending patterns when they have to shell out more $$ for power.] A Quantitative Analysis of Pricing Behavior in California's Wholesale Electricity Market During Summer 2000 by Paul Joskow MIT and Edward Kahn Analysis Group Electricity Restructuring and the Cost of Pollution Reduction by Dallas Burtraw Karen Palmer Ranjit Bharvirkar and Anthony Paul Resources for the Future Before I discuss the specific papers and presenters one big picture point needs to be made. There was an unchallenged consensus at this conference that the generators have exercised market power to the tune of billions of dollars. The focus was on how and how much not whether. The good news is that I heard no evidence supporting any collusion theory the thought was that generators are making independent output and pricing decisions knowing they could influence the market price given the auction rules and the completely inelastic demand. On the other hand I would have to say that the economic work on the tacit collusion hypothesis in incomplete at best. The bad news is that the scale of potential overcharges is pretty staggering -- >$5 billion. The plaintiffs will be able to put together quite a damage study. Crespo Bidding Asymmetries in UK: This is a marginally relevant paper examining whether bidders in the UK electricity auction markets behaved in a leader-follower mode i.e. asymmetrically. Crespo's model shows that in a uniform price-setting auction with clearing price rules a price setter will emerge and take all prices above marginal cost. Thus above marginal cost pricing does not require coordination. Crespo (from NERA) appeared knowledgeable but is not an inspiring speaker. His paper also got roughed up a bit in the audience questioning segment. Puller Pricing and Firm Conduct in California's Deregulated Electricity Market: This is a very relevant paper as it tries to determine whether market power (presumably) exercised in California was static or dynamic meaning the product of individual firm decisionmaking (static) or tacit collusion (dynamic). The period studied was 4/98 to 12/99. Puller found evidence of static market power consistent with so-called Cournot pricing. This theory posits that in an oligopoly firms will take their rivals' observed price/output decisions as a given and decide how to maximize profitability given that behavior. He then tried to determine whether any dynamic games were occurring meaning a game where firms recognize their interdependence and try to follow a supergame trigger strategy in which firms try to induce favorable responses from rivals. It's quite complicated how he goes about this but fundamentally he tries to correlate observed output decisions with how a firm at that time might have expected a change in its behavior to affect its future share of the market. With this methodology Puller finds what he called weak evidence of forward-looking dynamic pricing for a brief time in 1998 but not otherwise. My impression was that the evidence for 1998 was very weak and the logic used to arrive at this conclusion was also weak. Puller then went at this a second time with a theory that attempts to determine what a firm's supply function would look like if it was exercising static and dynamic market power and then comparing this to an estimate of that firm's actual supply function. I found this even more speculative than the first theory. Nonetheless the results are basically the same: evidence of static but not dynamic market power. Puller took a lot of heat for the methodology of this paper during the questioning segment. He's not a dynamic speaker and does not appear to me to be a strong expert candidate. Anjali Sheffrin's commentary was very important. She is the Director of Market Analysis for CAISO. After general comments on Crespo and Puller she launched in to a discussion of whether their models explained the California experience. This turned out to be a preview of the CAISO FERC filing of last week in which they allege $5.5 billion in market power-related overcharges from May 200 to Feb. 2001. That filing and Sheffrin's report follow. They are essential reading. Sheffrin maintains that it was the absence of imports during this period that left the market power of the California generators unchecked. This permitted the in-state generators to engage in either economic or physical withholding of power. (Economic withholding is bidding a higher-than-needed supply curve physical withholding is cutting output at the plant.) Her study was intended to (1) Identify individual firms engaging in market power activity and (2) Analyze how each firms' actions set market clearing prices. She utilized full bidding data in CA ISO real time market for each hour between May and Nov 2000 defined and categorized bidding patterns and identified economic or physical withholding and then calculated bid-cost mark-up and a monopoly rent. She found what she claimed was strong evidence of both types of withholding but that economic withholding is the dominant bidding pattern used by the five large California generators. While Sheffrin's study does not name names it claims that most of the five in-state suppliers and many of the [16] large importers displayed bidding patterns which were consistent with the exercise of market power. Bernstein and Himmelstein were positively gleeful during this presentation. On the question of collusion Sheffrin's study is not terribly illuminating. She maintains that the dominant bidding pattern is consistent with two characteristics of a supply function equilibrium model of oligopolist pricing. I take that to mean Cournot which is a static non-collusive model. However when you read her study you'll see the picture is not entirely clear. Lien The Curse of Market Power: This is only marginally relevant for us as its thesis is that forward-looking supply contracts are better for both producers and society. Everyone seemed to agree -- and were confused why we needed a paper to prove it. Lien (U. Md.) is young and not expert material. Joskow and Kahn: (paper) (Kahn's slides). I'm sure many of you have already read this everyone should. Prepared for SoCal Edison it contends that 4 in-state generators (Reliant Dynegy AES/Williams and Southern/Mirant) exercised market power by withholding capacity during the summer or 2000. J&K use publicly available data on loads market prices and generation to (a) quantify combined effects of market fundamentals on market prices (b) calculate price gap (difference between actual prices and competitive market benchmarks) (c) account for quantify effects of ISO's ancillary services requirements and forced outages and then (d) calculate the output gap for high priced hours meaning the difference between observed and maximum profitable levels of generation. They conclude that prices were far in excess of the competitive benchmark and that the 4 in-state generators could have produced more power at competitive prices but chose not to. Hence market power was exercised. Kahn the Analysis Group economist who presented is a very colorful and rather undisciplined advocate of his position. He threw around allegations of conspiracy rather casually but mostly to be funny. I couldn't tell whether he believed his study proved that I don't think it even speaks to it. But Bernstein and Himmelstein applauded him when he finished grinning ear to ear. Severin Borenstein UC Berkeley and the conference director was supposed to comment on J&K but hardly did. He said that the generators would have been stupid not to exercise market power given the supply/demand conditions and the market rules and argued that permitting long term contracts and requiring real-time residential pricing were the solutions to all of this. Borenstein was the best expert material I saw at this conference and the fact he took a pass on the details of the J&K paper is puzzling to me. It made me wonder whether he already has a horse in this race or perhaps is trying to stay above it all. Hope this is useful. Regards Dan Daniel M.

Wood's two-day hearing on Wholesale Markets which concluded today (8/24) in San Diego. Three Commissioner's were present (Wood Lynch and Neeper) with Duque and Bilas participating by phone. Administrative Law Judge Wetzel was present and a transcript was taken. The quasi-legislative hearing was the beginning of a record developed for the investigation into the workings of wholesale/retail markets. This session focused on Wholesale markets. There will be subsequent sessions on retail issues market structure and other related issues in the future. My conclusion from this session is that Wood is looking for support for increasing regulatory intervention in the market. Dan Larcamp Director of the Office of markets Tariffs and Rates FERC was present. He relayed FERC's concern of this matter and a desire to hold hearings in San Diego. He also relayed that Hoecker held a press conference announcing the opening of a 206 investigative proceeding into the operation of the wholesale markets in California which carried with it refund authority. The format of the hearing was to respond to pre-filed questions developed by Wood/Lynch. Each member of the panel would respond to the questions and any questions posed by the Commissioners the Judge or the CPUC Attorney. No questions were posed by members of the audience. Yesterday's panel of academics were comprised of: 1. Dr. Timothy Duane-UC Berkley 2. Dr. William Hogan-Harvard 3. Dr. Frank Wolak-Stanford (ISO Market Surveillance Committee) 4. David Marcus-Energy Consultant for the Coaltion of Utility Employees 5. Dr. Gene Coyle 6. Dr. Jean-Michel Glachant Universite Paris I Pantheon Sorbonne The panel was asked to speak as individuals and not on behalf of any institutions they may represent. While the purpose of the panel seemed to be to determine that market power was being exercised and that prices were too high and therefore not just and reasonable the panelist stopped short of blaming generators and market participants in behaving illegally. The concensus generally was that market power did exist at various times but the mere existence did not constitute bad behavior. None with the exception of Dr. Wolak who is in the process of doing a study using recent data as part of his role for the Market Surveillance Committee had done a study. There was some discussion though not much of the monopsony power of the utilities. I think ultimately the group conceded that scarcity of supply amplified concerns about the exercise of market power as even the increase in gas costs did not fully explain the recent spikes. Wolak believes that encourage utilities to enter into forward purchases will reduce the exercise of real-time market power. Hogan seemed to be there with Sempra's interests in mind. He continued to promote expansion of the ISO's abilities to dispatch load as well as maintain system reliability. There was alot of discussion about forward purchase ability for utilities so as to be less subject to volatile market prices. The concerns were also discussed about the appropriateness of a distribution utility making purchasing decisions on behalf of its customers. This included discussion of separation of these functions and the default provider role. Most everyone agreed that rolling back to a regulated market was not feasible without raising other major and serious concerns however there seemed to be support for some interim measures where cost-of-service regulation may be a good idea and that was during peak periods. All agreed that a demand response and price signals are important in the long-run although not to the extent currently experienced in San Diego. Today's panel included representatives from SDG&E SCE and PG&E TURN UCAN and ORA. While yesterday's panel maintained objectivity as to whether or not generators were exercising market power to the detriment of the system today's panel made no bones about the generators being to blame. SCE/PG&E indicated their need for relief for recovery of market costs in excess of the rate freeze. SDG&E was still on the hot seat for their inaction in hedging any of their supply. SDG&E brought up their failed PBR proposal and ORA and UCAN thought that that may be one way to incent the utility to be more responsible with their purchases. UCAN discussed the Governor's direction and the potential for putting rate caps into affect for residential and small commercial. He mentioned that C&I customers are experience difficulties as well. TURN raised the need for cost-based bid caps and cost-based peaking contracts. Mike Florio TURN urged against any further divestitute of assets and alleged market concentration on those assets that had been divested. In fact TURN urged the Commission to seek legislation to clarify the Commission's authority to order retention of assets. Neeper urged that part of the solution should be changing the current requirement to use the PX as the only authorized exchange although TURN disagreed.

Good new - The Williamson Act passed the Senate 34-1 It should be heard at the assembly Saturday or Monday if it is not redirected to a Committee hearing. 2. There was a long meeting with Ducheny with regards to AB 970. The enviro's boycotted they want to draft a bill with Keeley. Labor was obstructionist - they wanted to gut all the expediting siting language with regards to all facilities except for the peaking plants. Rate Cap related bills 1. The Edison Language on Rate Stabilization may not go anywhere. Edison has not found an author because of the efforts of Enron and others lobbying against it. Furthermore there are signs that Gov. Davis opposes it. 2. The Governor's office has issued a proposed language for a rate cap bill. The language however is not available as of yet. It may be released today or tomorrow. SDG&E has shown concerns over the content of the bill. They seem to think that it is worse than initially proposed by the Governor in his press release. The bill includes retroactive rate caps through 6/1/00. The rate cap could reflect Wood's rate cap proposal (6.5 cts cap on the energy component The bill does not specify who or how the costs associated with the cap will be recovered. (The reasoning is that UDCs will be more cautious in their procurement if there is uncertainty on who is responsible for the costs.) All of this is speculative. We hope to see the actual language soon. 3. Enron has been working with the Republican leadership to promote a rate cap proposal similar to the amended language we have proposed for AB2290. The bill focuses only on SDG&E customers and our major principals are the following. The Interim Rate Cap should be limited to residential and small commercial customers plus specific institutions that have a significant public role such as schools and hospitals. The Interim Rate Cap should be limited to the period ending December 31 2001. The Interim Rate Cap must be structured so that any undercollection is eventually recovered from the same customers who benefit from the lower rates provided by the rate cap.

Given the recent issues power plant development has had in Florida (big political fights that are going the wrong way) I was wondering if it made sense to bring together a meeting of all of Public Affairs and the deal team to analyze the implications of our development plans. My primary worry is that P/L under water could have severe ecological implications that are not being internalized into the transaction. I would like to try and arrange a meeting to (1) ensure Public Affairs coordination and (2) understand the deal impacts better. Please advise if I'm worrying for no good reason.

The hearings will continue tomorrow with all of the five FERC commissioners as witnesses plus private sector witnesses. Today's hearing went well from our perpective with support for Super RTOs and general support for expanding the grid both physically and from an access view point voiced by Senators and witnesses. Sen. Craig Thomas even said four RTOs were too many -- there should be one national RTO to run a national grid. Today's witnesses represented the Dept. of Energy EPSA EEI NRECA APPA IBEW union Alliance to Save Energy ELCON NERC NARUC NASUCA and the State of New Mexico. We will provide a more detailed analysis after completing a review of the lengthy written testimony but a summary of the DOE testimony and the first panel of private sector witnesses follows. 1. DOE said they are working on electricity legislative language. Should be done soon. Chairman Bingaman said they needed to get it done in time for the Committee to consider it when the Committee takes up electricity as early as the second week in September. Deputy Sec. Blake implied that their proposal was or would soon be shared with other Administration agencies for review. 2. In response to questions Blake said that legislative action on jurisdiction questions (fed v. state) would be useful but he stressed that they view any new legislation as clarifying that FERC has authority they feel already exists. He said that while states have an important role to play Congress must recongize the interstate character of the market and the need for open access to the interstate grid. (In response to a question Blake later said that FERC had largely addressed the access issue or would do so.) 3. On reliability he was given a chance to say that DOE supports th NERC consensus language but instead repeated that the Administration favors enforceable reliability standards but wants to work with the Committee on the exact language. I took this as confirmation of what we have heard informally from DOE in terms of key players there not being enamored of the NERC consensus approach at least as it exists in its old long form. 4. Sens. Craig and Cantwell pushed Blake on why the Administration has not fully supported BPA's request for a debt limit increase to finance expansion of the BPA grid. Blake said they support the BPA expansion projects but that OMB feels BPA has enough borrowing authority through 2003. This did not sit well with Craig and Cantwell. I spoke with Sen. Craig in the hall following up on a conversation I had with him the other evening about BPA and he stressed that he is committed to getting BPA the debt limit it needs. As you know commercial has asked us to help BPA given matters pending between Enron and BPA. 5. On the first private sector panel even John Rowe the Co-CEO of Exelon and past EEI chairman (testifying for his company and EEI) said several times that there should be strong RTOs that each cover a wide idea. He said his board voted yesterday to sell its transmission assets IF a strong independent operator could be found. Rowe also said that RTOs should be encouraged (implying not mandatory?). The APPA witness was strong on RTOs saying that all entities will be part of RTOs even without legislation. NRECA said that co-ops would oppose federal jurisdiction over them and that they favor voluntary RTOs. EPSA made the usual case for competition open access RTOs etc. [/INST] Category: Company Business, Strategy, etc.(elaborate in Section 3 [Topics])"

We made progress on transparency less so on market-based rates. On transparency Leon understands our concerns. In a nutshell he seemed amenable to amending the langauge to avoid the result of having to divulge transaction-specific trade-specific information. We persuaded Leon that was the impact of the initial language although he initially said details would be left to FERC. We persuaded him that if any data is to be provided it MUST be only in aggregate form. We also impressed on him that if as he said the intent is to leave details to FERC -- then more of the details should be left to FERC not set by statute. Leon strongly advised that we seek to craft language consistent with the above exchange that makes as few changes to the draft as needed to make the necessary corrections. This will make it easier for Leon to navigate the internal waters of the staff. (Sam Fowler th chief counsel is a drafting stickler). Others should obviously weigh in and review this but to facilitate internal comments (we need to get back to Leon today) here is my take on what he has in mind. Under new sec. 218(b) (to be added to the FPA by bill sec. 413) (pg. 13) under information required we would rewrite paragraph 2 as follows: (2) each broker exchange or other market-making entity that matches offers to sell and offers to buy wholesale electric energy in interstate commerce to provide aggregate statistical information about its sales of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce. The effect of the language change is drop the reference to sale prices of each sale of electric energy. By leaving it as aggregate statistical information this should give FERC maximum flexibility to permit indexes etc. As to the timely basis of information release (subsection (c)) the alternatives sent yesterday would require this to be done on the Internet after the end of the trading day. If we can restrict this to aggregate data question arises whether we want to concede that this would be done daily. That suggests the data to be collected would be more than we would want I think. Here is a take on how we might suggest a revision to that language to give FERC more leeway: (c) TIMELY BASIS -- The Commission shall require the information required under subsection (b) to be posted on the Internet and updated as frequently as practicable and appropriate. The change is to add appropriate so that FERC can consider other than whether posting is practicable. The use of appropriate is what came to mind -- perhaps there is some other word or phrase like consistent with ... or promote competition or some way of saying there are policy considerations other than practicability. There should be some valid purpose established before data is released. I would argue that the (d) language on commercially sensitive information goes only to exempting from disclosure not when disclosure is appropriate. Please let me have your thoughts although the tragedy in NYC and DC now underway will probably make this not a day to transact such business on the Hill. Will provide a further report on market-based rates. In sum Leon was not as sympathetic on this issue but asked for our ideas and further arguments. We sense Leon personally feels strongly about moving the FPA to some linkage to competitive markets. His argument is that market participants can be doing everything by the book and the result can still be uncompetitive markets. We pushed that penalizing us is not the answer -- nor is increasing regulatory uncertainty about deals doing to help keep prices down. Leon clearly does not intend this language to punish Enron -- but others who we might all agree have done things that are not in keeping with competitive markets.

It looks like there may be some key personnel we want to employ but that there are many whom we don't want to hire. I am not really familiar with the specific facts here. The question of a joint employer arises when a company treats its contract personnel like its own -- by setting compensation controlling their activities engaging in etc. decisions and other ways in which an employer treats its own employees. So if the plan is to have workers doing the same thing with one as a contractor and one as an employee there could be some issues particularly if they share a supervisor. Unfortunately that often is the case with contract personnel. If there are distinctions among the various responsibilities of these workers -- and like workers are treated similarly -- the risk may be reduced. It is cleanest however to use all of these workers through the contracting agency for a while (assume we don't want to hire them all which is the other alternative). Then the company may want to make selected offers to people who may be in a managerial role or have some other distinction from the bulk of the contract workers. I would like additional information on this situation before reaching a definitive conclusion. So let's try to discuss it. I am booked until about 11 this morning but am available after that.

However in the California proceeding we are also afforded the opportunity in the Order to offset our receivables against any refund that would otherwise have to be paid by us. Also to the extent that our receivables exceed the refund amount the Order provides for payment of interest to us in accordance with CFR Section 35.19a. At present I am aware of the existence of three receivables. As you will recall I mentioned at Tuesday's meeting that we should be able to treat as a receivable for purposes of offset the revenues due us from the application of the CAISO underscheduling penalty. I communicated the possibility of offsetting this receivable against any potential refund at this mornings Western Wholesale conference call and subsequent research conducted by Alan Comnes indicates that the CAISO owes us $30MM as per the CAISO's own numbers. The CAISO also owes us approximately $40MM due to nonpayment for one to two months of business. These two figures alone totalling approximately $70MM exceed the estimate of our potential exposure in the California proceeding. Finally the negative CTC issue is another receivable due us by IOU's that under the plain language of the Order could potentially be used to offset any refund amount. I am not aware of the magnitude of this receivable but do understand that there are some sensitivities regarding this issue including concerns about revealing the amount of the credit due us. It is likely that the amount would become public if it is presented in the California proceeding. Please give us your thoughts as to the use of the CTC receivable to offset potential refunds in the California proceeding.

In this case FERC stated that a trial-type hearing is not necessary . . . . and specifically rejected the use of a trial-type evidentiary hearing. Slip op. at 47-48 & n.97. Thus while I have not researched the matter as yet my preliminary view is that the CPUC's attempt to invoke FERC's discovery processes would appear to be outside the contemplation of FERC's Nov. 1 order and its regulations unless FERC specifically orders discovery in this case. (The CPUC seems to recognize the relevance of this consideration when it specifically attempts to equate paper hearings with trial-type hearings see page 1 of its Motion.) The CPUC's motion may prompt FERC to decide whether or not to allow discovery in this case under Rule 401. While the CPUC's motion does not apply directly to marketers FERC's ruling will be precedent in the event the CPUC or someone else hereafter serves discovery on other parties. As a result we need to consider whether laying in the weeds risks losing an opportunity to present our views on whether FERC should allow discovery in a paper hearing with an expedited decisional track particularly in light of the fact that Staff has already conducted. >>> Jeffrey Watkiss 11/08/00 10:31AM >>> Does anyone have an idea as to why marketers including EPMI are not included in the list of subject companies: Exh. B? Since EPMI is not a subject of the motion why should it answer? Lying in the weeds may be a more prudent course of action. >>> Fergus Gary S. <GFergus@brobeck.com> 11/07/00 10:08PM >>> I just spoke with Mary to make sure we have the same information. Here are the facts we have so far. On November 4th the CPUC filed a motion with FERC to adopt the form of protective order that the CPUC entered to compel the production of documents and to shorten time to answer. According to Exhibit B (read to me by Nancy Pickover at Bracewell) the following CPUC moved against the following entities: AES Williams Duke Dynegy Reliant and Southern. Enron entities were NOT named in exhibit B. This is not to say that we could not be easily added to the group. While the motion reads as if the CPUC was moving against everybody in fact in footnote 2 they state they are only moving against the entities named in Exhibit B. We will have Exhibit B in hand first thing tomorrow via FEDEX to confirm this. To repeat Enron is not named yet.

Alan Comnes Meeting went from about 10:30 to 1 p.m. Written materials discussed at this meeting are available at www.caiso.com/bog. 1. Budget. Board approved budget which contains a significant increase in GMCs and for the first time applies GMC fees on the self provision of A/S. The motion to adopt was modified to say the Board would revisit budget if in response to Gov. Davis requests to par budgets the CAISO budget is cut. 2. Retirement plan Audit 3. Allocation of Above-MCP 487 charges. This mechanism will improve the allocation of OOM costs so that the per-MWh charges match up with actual OOM costs. Stated that penalty revenues used to lower OOM costs could come from imbalance penalties. Action. approved (?) to allow staff to make a tariff amendment on this change. 4. Winter Assessment. Presentation by staff Kahn took issue (i.e. did not even want staff report presented) that CAISO does an assessment without consulting the Power Authority CPUC and the CEC. Worried about conflicting with the other resource assessments out there and giving media ways to take shots at DWR buying practices. In the end the full presentation was not given but questions were asked about whether the assessment spells trouble or provides assurance. The answer: things are tight in some months but are expected to be ok given the level of conservative assumptions used in the analysis. Action: staff was tasked to compare this assessment with CEC's and others and come back in another month. 5. Generator maintenance program. Will use GADS data. This program is mandatory for PGA generator units. CAISO staffer represented that no other ISO has a prescriptive program like the one CAISO is proposing. Current schedule: brief FERC staff next week return to Board in November for approval make FERC filing implement in early '02. Benchmarks are based on each unit's historical performance i.e. dogs will be benchmarked against their past doggy behavior. There is no component to raise the bar on performance but a unit that falls relative to past performance would trigger further review. 6. MSC Selection Committee. MSC provides independent review of the CAISO markets for CAISO the state and FERC. Wolak is the only member left at the moment. Selection committee will be Sheffrin Wolak and Borenstein. Candidates will go to Exec. Director and the final candidates to the Board in February 2002 (!). Kahn questioned how the MSC can survive with only one member and take until February 02 to select a final members. Nonetheless the glacially paced schedule was adopted. 7. FERC RTO Seams Issues. Steve Greenleaf presented. Updated BOG on RTO week and said that the 4 RTO model took a step backward (off the table in the words of Chair Wood) in response to criticism from state PUCs on Thursday. (Is this an accurate recounting of Day 4?). ISO is engaged in interregional coordination. Mentioned CSIC group Mentions SSGWY's (?)sponsorship of a market monitoring workshop on November 16. 8. Update of CERS Settlement BEEP/AS Payment Procedure. Edison and PG&E are making progress but no agreement with CERS have been reached. SDG&E signed and the procedure was implemented at least in part with SDG&E. 9. Monthly reports: financial. 10. Monthly reports: DMA. Sheffrin. Mostly followed the briefing charts. Emphasized the following: CERS OOM purchases are generally down and are reasonably priced once purchases and sales are disaggregated. Said that suppliers are still bidding above costs. DMA files confidential reports that include info on bidding data weekly to FERC. Bids are not coming down. Intrazonal congestion is up due to new generation coming on line. That allows generators to play the dec game. [/INST] Category: Company Business, Strategy, etc.(elaborate in Section 3 [Topics])"

Leslie Lawner 03/20/2001 08:45 AM To: James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron Shelley Corman/Enron@EnronXGate Rebecca W Cantrell/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron Harry Kingerski/NA/Enron@Enron Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron Subject: FERC's marketing affiliate conference Becky and I attended FERC's gas marketing affiliate conference last week. Non-affiliated competitors continue to build straw men and describe abuses with no real evidence to back them up (the funny money argument and capacity hoarding are two examples. The funny money argument assumes marketing affiliates will bid above market rates for capacity because they excess payment is going to the corporate bottom line. Hoarding capacity to drive up price may be an issue but it is not a marketing affiliate issue as anyone can do it). FERC staff did not seem terribly sympathetic to the points made but at least one FERC staffer seemed to believe that one solution would be to require the pipelines to offer capacity in smaller blocks to let smaller entities put together bids. FERC also indicated they were in fact auditing compliance but in a non-public way. There were some concerns voiced which I agree with and there is an opportunity to file additional comments on Apr. 30. I would like to put the following in these comments: Evidence of affiliate abuse/preference is just not there. The best folks can do is make up stuff. We welcome FERC monitoring if that is needed to bring confidence to the marketplace that abuse is not occurring. But the issue is really whether we do have a crisis of confidence or merely a bunch of disgruntled competitors who are just seeking to neutralize the affiliated competitors). The FERC rules and the information reported (with a caveat) under those rules are adequate for detection and enforcement and deterrence. That said the definition of marketing affiliate should be expanded to include affiliated electric generators who are siting plants along affiliate pipelines. The pipeline 637 reporting and internet systems should allow users to download and manipulate transportation related data which is not currently the case. We also need to address a deal on Northern where ENA took capacity at a discount albeit after other parties had an opportunity to match our bid. This was a deal brought up in the conference. Let me know how this sounds. Thanks. [/INST] Category: Personal but in professional context(e.g., it was good working with you)"

I do think we need to talk this through. In the meantime though let's not make anymore VPs until this is resolved. As I said in my original message I am not looking to undo what has been done but to make sure we don't do it again unless the process is followed. I understand that there are significant title differences across the regions we operate. In fact one of the people in my organization who did not make VP is Dennis Vegas who has done an extraordinary job in Latin America. Notwithstanding his regional focus (and the significance of a VP title in his region) he was put through the company wide process and he David Haug and I submit everyone else on the Exec Comm understood that every new VP would go through the same process regardless of regional assignment (with the exception of certain joint venture companies). But I maintain that we need some consistency in the VP title in particular -- i.e. that it remain an Enron-wide title granted only through the PRC process. Though I don't personally feel this way for many people in the organization the VP title means something separate from the compensation structure it implies something like making partner in a legal or consulting firm. Making that cut should not vary based on where you live or what region you support. I also understand the point about needing a certain title for external purposes. In my organization we are dealing with very title-conscious elected officials and media. I can make the case for every one of my directors and senior directors that they would be more effective externally if they carried a more senior title regardless of any change in compensation. As an executive committee we elected to make such an exception only for legacy title holders -- i.e. people who had previously made VP outside the process. Everyone in my organization To: Cindy Olson@ENRON Steven J Kean@EES cc: Sanjay Subject: Job Titles and Job Banding From reading the e-mails on the issue regarding Regional Vice President at Enron India it sounds like there will be more discussion on this issue. I know that issues like this generally come up at the Enron ExCom level. There are a few issues that need to be kept in mind and although Cindy and I have discussed these in the past I have not had an opportunity to pursue them further (but would be happy to help out on this). I have noticed these not only in India but also in the other international settings where I have worked for Enron during the past several years. 1. International job titles and domestic job titles do not correlate. For example in India the title Director implies a very senior person within the organization (well above VP) whereas in the Enron domestic world it is a position below VP. Managing Director within Enron is below the most senior levels but in India a MD is the Ken Lay equivalent. For this reason I cannot use Managing Director in my title or on my business card although this is my title for Enron Houston purposes. 2. Job titles are much more important in an international setting than in a domestic setting. For example in Houston we have people at the director (and probably manager) level who lead deal teams and bring deals to successful closing. In an international setting particularly India to get to the decision-makers in your counterpart organization an officer title of VP or above is very often required. To a certain degree this is form over substance but that's what works over here. 3. To solve some of these problems Enron should consider doing what some other international companies have done (and I think Cindy and her team may already be working on this). A job banding study should be done and based on responsibilities everyone globally should be placed in a band. It would not be a title band of VP or director or manager but rather a band with a non-title classification. I hate to suggest a band with numbers such as 1 through 15 because that sounds way too much like the government but something like that would work. Once this is done communication is made to employees that the band is what is key in determining their compensation and level within the organization. Then the business units can rely on their particular market dynamics or on what their competition is doing to determine job titles. Thus if the Global Origination group needs to have a title of Senior Trader and EECC needs a title of Project Leader and Enron India needs a Regional Vice President all can be accomplished while keeping these same people at a consistent level for global Enron purposes. I will be happy to discuss this further with any of you. Plus I will volunteer to participate in finding a solution that works for all of Enron while taking into account the specifc business unit and/or global function needs.

But if Pat Wood likes it and thinks it is balanced that undercuts our position. Since the trade press is not always accurate I thought I would first check with those of you who were there. Thanks.

I am checking on the final list of other panelists and will advise. Finally Andy Black of Chairman Barton's staff advises that they will release draft RTO language as early as today. We expect that this draft will not be to our liking. Barton thinks FERC is moving too quickly and with too much force. We expect his proposal to set a deadline of something like 12 months for utilities to join an RTO. The key is in part whether he allows FERC to continue to decide what constitutes an acceptable RTO or whether he will try to grandfather in some fashion those RTOs that have been proposed by utilities to date.

As most of you will by now know probably the most significant risk would arise in a situation where Enron has confidential information about a reference entity and wrongfully uses that information in pricing the credit derivative on that entity. This could well result in legal proceeding against Enron. In practice an allegation of misuse of confidential information can be very difficult indeed to defend without adequate procedures in place to safeguard that information. In fact Enron's credit trading will as you know rely strictly on publicly available financial information and will not involve the use of confidential information unless the reference entity has specifically consented. Nevertheless to avoid the appearance of impropriety we are taking additional steps to consider confidentiality agreements we have in place with potential reference entities before deciding whether or not we will quote prices on such entities. Against this background is the ever-present risk of insider dealing. This crime - which in the UK carries a maximum prison sentence of 7 years and an unlimited fine - is committed where a person (or member of their family etc) deals in the securities (shares bonds or derivatives on them) of a listed company on the basis of unpublished (confidential) price-sensitive information. We do not expect at this time to deal in publicly traded bonds as part of EnronCredit.com but insider dealing is relevant to the conduct of Enron staff and could affect other parts of our business. In addition SFA rules in the UK require the safeguarding of confidential information the misuse of which is a serious disciplinary matter. In order to ensure the success of this new business and that confidential information is not misused either by Enron or its staff we are now introducing important new policies and procedures in Europe and in the US. These procedures have been drawn up specifically for your credit trading group by lawyers in London Houston and New York and are attached. Please familiarise yourself and any future member of the group with these procedures. Once you have read and understood the attached procedures each one of you is required to confirm this to me in writing (or by note mail). Please note that similar procedures have been distributed to the key business heads in Europe who may have confidential information about reference entities (similar procedures are being disrtibuted to US business heads). This requires them to safeguard confidential information and to abide by the Restriced List procedure described below. Nevertheless you should treat your group as being within a Chinese Wall and see it as your personal responsibility not to solicit or accept from anyone in Enron information about reference entities which may be confidential. Thank you for your co-operation in implementing these important new procedures. I look forward to receiving your confirmation mentioned above (which is also described in the procedures).

This will involve quoting prices for buying and selling bankruptcy protection in respect of reference entities many of whom are our counterparties in a variety of different commercial and financial contexts. This exciting cocktail of credit derivatives and Enron Online raises significant novel legal risks for Enron. Probably the most significant risk arises where Enron has confidential information about a reference entity and wrongfully uses that information in pricing the credit derivative on that entity. This could well result in legal proceeding against Enron. In practice an allegation of misuse of confidential information can be very difficult indeed to defend without adequate procedures in place to safeguard that information. Against this background is the ever-present risk of insider dealing. This crime - which carries a maximum prison sentence of 7 years and an unlimited fine - is committed where a person (or member of their family etc) deals in the securities (shares or bonds) of a listed company on the basis of unpublished (confidential) price-sensitive information. In addition SFA rules require the safeguarding of confidential information the misuse of which is a serious disciplinary matter. In order to ensure the success of this new business we are now introducing new policies and procedures (attached) which include a simple Restricted List procedure. In essence they require you - to take prudent steps to safeguard confidential information within Enron to notify Michael Brown Mark Elliott or myself if you become aware of confidential information (or circumstances) about a counterparty which you think might make it appropriate for that counterparty to be placed on the Restricted List. To make life easier numerous examples of the types of information which might be relevant are set out in the attached procedures so please familiarise yourself and anyone else in your group you think appropriate with them. As you will see you are not expected to make difficult determinations about whether an entity should or should not be added to the Restricted List just to let us know if you think there is a possibility that it should be added. We will also provide quick briefing sessions to ensure that each of you is comfortable with these new procedures. Many thanks for your co-operation.

This is not the most clearly drafted provision as it was the subject of much negotiation....and was significantly narrowed from the original scope proposed by AEP. Thus please consult with me prior to entering into any solicitation agreement or arrangement which might arguably be covered by our limited covenant not to compete on the supply side for 3 months. There are many aspects of the post-close transition which will require cooperation between Enron and AEP/HPL and thus it behoves us to carefully weigh the risks and rewards of stepping too close to or over the line. Furtheralthough a technical reading of the non-competition agreement only applies to ENA no ENA UPSTREAM deals which would violate this covenant if there were to be done as ENA should be done without clearance from Brian Redmond and me. Please communicate this restriction to those who report to you and have need to be aware of this limited restriction.

It is complicated and has been amended several times. In view of these factors V&E should tell us whether we can use the $2.5 million of cash from the insurance recovery to retroactively reclaim a portion of the 4th quarter API's. In particular Baird should give us this opinion since he has handled the partnership agreement since day one. Baird is gone on vacation for the next week. He is planning to give us an answer within a few days of his return. He will give the matter serious thought but what we are asking is pretty aggressive. His associate Carlos Pena has reviewed the partnership agreement and his first take on the question is that we cannot revise the available cash for the fourth quarter in this way. But the matter requires far more thought than this----and Bob will also need to talk with Lori (also gone on vacation) to come up with a meaningful answer for us. I will stay after this but in light of the above it will probably be early July b/f we get V&E's final position on this. If this won't do please let me know and I'll explore other avenues of getting an answer out of V&E. Thanks. SWD [/INST] Category: Company Business, Strategy, etc.(elaborate in Section 3 [Topics])"

Portland Ore.-Based Firm Says California Has Capacity for Electricity Needs Dan McSwain  North County Times Escondido Calif. ( October 17 2000 ) Oct. 13--PORTLAND Ore.--A private investigation of state power markets has come to the conclusion that California had plenty of electricity generating capacity this summer. The state enjoyed a 32 percent reserve margin even as wholesale prices soared and the state's power manager declared 36 separate power emergencies because California was thought to be in the grips of a critical shortage according to the investigation. The author of the investigation's preliminary report Portland-based economist and utility industry consultant Robert McCullough said at a conference of analysts power traders and electricity industry regulators Thursday that he has found evidence that generators and trading companies manipulated the production of power from June through August to create a false shortage and push up prices. The Encina power plant in Carlsbad provides a stark example: it ran at well below its full capacity for much of June even though wholesale power prices ---- and consumer electricity bills ---- shot to well above the generating plant's cost of production. The actual production of electricity by the plants was determined by an analysis of data from the Environmental Protection Agency which monitors emissions. We are seeing a lot of under-generation McCullough said. This is market power in action. Market power is a term used by economists to describe the ability of market participants -- in this case suppliers -- to influence prices. Many of the industry experts present at the conference Thursday reaffirmed their belief that supply shortages were very real this summer and contributed to high prices but several participants said deregulation has reduced the amount of market information that is available to analysts. Mainstream economists have questioned the accuracy of data from federal agencies including the EPA. Conventional explanations for the low energy production observed in San Diego County are scant. Encina's operators a joint venture of energy giants Dynegy Inc. and NRG Energy Inc. called Cabrillo Power confirmed that the power plant had no abnormal maintenance problems. The San Diego Regional Air Quality Board said Wednesday that the power plant was well within its state-mandated pollution limits. But David Lloyd the corporate secretary of Cabrillo denied that the Encina plant has been used to game the San Diego County power markets. That can't possibly be right Lloyd said of McCullough's analysis. In North County we were right on the ragged edge of being off (an emergency shutdown because of heavy output). Without knowing the specific details of time and which units were on or off I can't comment Lloyd said. We certainly don't want to be accused of anything wrongful he said. We don't have that much power in California and for us to be shutting down in California to push up the price somewhere else doesn't make sense for us. We want to run all we can when the prices are high. Electricity prices have soared to record levels since May resulting in a doubling and tripling of power bills this summer for the 1.2 million customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Co. and causing an estimated $5 billion in losses for Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric. State lawmakers have intervened on behalf of San Diego County consumers with a retail rate cap but the law in turn created a looming IOU that could grow beyond $300 million if high wholesale prices persist. No fewer than five private state and federal investigations are under way to assess the competitiveness of power markets in the interconnected Western states. The investigations also seek to answer charges that the companies which produce and trade electricity have either figured out how to exploit deregulated markets to outmaneuver regulators or have engaged in outright manipulation in order to increase profits. Inquiries by the California Public Utilities Commission Electricity Oversight Board and attorney general along with a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission investigation were launched in July and August. Staff investigators of the state and federal commissions said this week that they are still in the process of issuing subpoenas and gathering market data. McCullough was hired in late May by the Seattle city utility and a consortium of large industrial power consumers in the Pacific Northwest to investigate the price spikes. His effort is thought to be the first to complete an exhaustive analysis of state and federal information that tracks the amount of electricity that was available and compares it to the amount of power that was actually used. Chief among McCullough's findings was that demand for power was lower this summer than what was forecasted by the Western Systems Coordinating Council a federal agency that is charged with ensuring the stability of the vast web of power transmission lines that connect California to 13 other Western states British Columbia and northern Mexico. McCullough provided a copy of his preliminary findings Tuesday to the North County Times and the initial reaction of the state's energy community was one of deep skepticism. EPA data is notoriously unreliable said Frank Wolak a Stanford professor and the chairman of the market surveillance committee of the California Independent System Operator the agency that manages the state grid and which has paid enormous sums for emergency power this summer. To gauge the actual output of power plants that burn fossil fuel McCullough used emissions data from the EPA. Greed would get the best of anybody Wolak said. I found a lot of hours where in-state generators were exceeding nameplate capacity. These guys were cranking it out. Wolak in a study of power markets for the system operator did conclude however that exercise of market power by power generators and traders was the major cause of higher prices this summer. At the conference in Portland most of the panelists did not openly criticize McCullough's analysis but implicitly disputed his conclusions by attributing higher prices and the presumed exercise of market power to a very real shortage of electricity generating capacity among the Western states. Low hydroelectric production in the Pacific Northwest and high temperatures in the Southwest were blamed for limiting California's ability to import electricity. Others said state and federal regulators along with market participants themselves won't really know what happened until more experts look at hard market information that is in short supply. Ron Eachus the chairman of the Oregon Public Utilities Commission said market information is routinely withheld from regulators the public and buyers of electricity but is shared among power generators and trading companies. If the market is sharing it with themselves but not us I don't buy that Eachus said. Tim Belden is the vice president of West Trading for Enron North America the largest marketer and trader of electricity in the world. Enron takes the unique stand that more information which has been labeled proprietary by companies such as when a plant is being run and how much the electricity is selling for should be made available instantly to the markets. Is there a smoking gun out there or are market participants behaving rationally? Belden said. California is characterized by secret black box market models that nobody understands he said. If you've got nothing to hide release the data. ----- To see more of the North County Times or to subscribe to the newspaper go to http://www.nctimes.com (c) 2000 North County Times Escondido Calif.

The department buys electricity fo= r the state's financially distressed utilities.=20 They didn't understand what they were going to be paid there was confusio= n over the FERC order Hidalgo said. We saw 1500 megawatts disappear.= =20 The problem was exacerbated by a heat wave across the West which forced Ca= lifornia to compete with other states for scarce electricity he said. Roll= ing blackouts hit southern Nevada.=20 Most California officials credit the FERC system which is based on a varia= ble price cap with reining in what had been a runaway wholesale power mark= et. But power generators have complained that the price caps by limiting p= rofits could discourage the production of critically needed electricity. A= nd as Monday's episode suggested even the uncertainty about where the cap = will fall could lead to unexpected shortages.=20 That's the risk that you run (with price controls) said Arthur O'Donnell=  editor of the newsletter California Energy Markets. People want any kind= of certainty at all.=20 Hidalgo said the state avoided blackouts only because of last-minute import= s from the Bonne=07ville Power Administration the federal agency that mark= ets government-produced hydroelectric power in the Pacific Northwest. The s= tate went into a Stage 2 power alert the next-to-last level before blackou= ts are ordered. The alert was canceled in late afternoon.=20 The blackouts would have been the first in California since May 8.=20 FERC imposed a round-the-clock ceiling on power throughout the West.

The state lost sales that would have provided enough electricity to su= pply more than 1 million homes said Ray Hart deputy director of the Calif= ornia Department of Water Resources which has been buying much of the stat= e's electricity since January. At least five companies producing or marketing power are telling us t= hat since they don't know what they're going to get paid they're not going= to take the risk and so they're not going to sell the energy Hart said. The electricity sales fell through after power consumption soared in s= ummer heat and grid operators were forced to declare a Stage 1 emergency m= eaning reserves had dipped below 7%. It was the first such emergency since = May 31. Under a June 19 order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission inte= nded to bring down wholesale electricity markets across the West a power e= mergency in California triggers the setting of a new price limit that appli= es to power plant owners from Washington to Arizona.=20 The new price is supposed to be based upon whatever it costs to run th= e most inefficient expensive power plant selling electricity to California= grid operators during the first full hour of a Stage 1 emergency. But much uncertainty remains about exactly how and when the new price = is supposed to be established under the commission's order and that appare= ntly drove away sellers Hart said. Shortly after the state issued the Stage 1 alert at 1:30 p.m. putting= the old price limit of $90 per megawatt-hour in question companies that h= ad committed to provide the state electricity hour by hour Monday afternoon= backed out Hart said. The companies include TransAlta Energy Marketing of= Oregon Constellation Power of Baltimore and Sempra Energy Trading a unit= of the San Diego-based energy conglomerate. Forced to dip even deeper into the state's power reserves and declare = a Stage 2 emergency water agency officials called the federal energy commi= ssion's hotline for clarification about what the new price should be and wh= en it should take effect. They got no answer. Hart said commission officials reached at home promised to try to clar= ify their order today. One outstanding question is what obligations power s= uppliers have to deliver electricity to California in an emergency. Both buyers and sellers in the market agree that the new price when i= t is set will probably be lower than $90 per megawatt-hour because the pri= ce of natural gas the main fuel in California power plants has dropped la= tely. Temperatures soared several degrees higher Monday than grid operators = had anticipated. But they said they expected to avoid rolling blackouts in = part because the Bonneville Power Administration in Portland Ore. had agr= eed to provide several hundred megawatts of Pacific Northwest hydropower ea= ch hour in exchange for a return of electricity from California later this = summer.

Our negative CTC claim was apparently not taken into account in compiling that list. The list is nonbinding however. PG&E will be required to file schedules of creditors on April 20. Our negative CTC claim should be on Schedule F (for unsecured claims). You may want to remind Glynn of your previous conversations and state our expectation that the negative CTC claim will appear (preferably as uncontested) in the April 20 filing. (Note: if PG&E does not include the claim we have an opportunity to file a proof of claim and ultimately the court determines the validity of the claim). Including Enron on the Creditors' Committee: PG&E may have the opportunity to influence representation on the creditors' committees. There are several reasons to suggest to Glynn that we be included: 1) we are a big creditor 2) we could be helpful in crafting a broader solution and 3) we are one of the real parties in interest behind the PX and ISO (who were listed as significant creditors but are really just passthroughs for the suppliers ... and PG&E likely would not want to have those political bodies serving on the creditors committee anyway).

(Frist is the NRSC chairman this cycle.) Enron including Jeff and Linda had been invited to the reception the purpose of which was to introduce ex-RNC chairman Haley Barbour as the NRSC's National Finance Chairman. Present were over a dozen Republican senators including Minority Leader Lott Whip Nickles and Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison Bunning (KY) Fitzgerald (IL) Cochran (MS) Inhofe (OK) Bond (MO) Crapo (ID) Voinovich (OH) Allen (VA) and Chafee (RI). The news from our perspective is that Haley Barbour singled out Ken Lay for praise as the first person to step to the plate and agree to help with their new Majority Makers program. This is the effort that Barbour will head up to raise $21 million for this election cycle by concentrating on events outside DC that would target businesses and business leaders without a DC presence. Barbour said that Ken had agreed to organize and chair a Houston fundraiser to raise $1 million toward the $21 million total. Ken was the first name he mentioned. The only others were the DeVos family in Michigan and Julie Finley a major GOP fundraiser based in DC. Needless to say I was suddenly quite popular after Haley made his remarks to the assembled group. Haley said he looked forward to working with us on this project. As you know from a previous e-mail Pat Shortridge had earlier seen our mutual friend Mitch Bainwol the executive director of the NRSC who had told Pat at lunch last week that Haley had spoken with Ken but last night was the first I had heard a dollar figure -- and a big one at that -- linked to the effort. While it was not stated I assume from the location and size of the event's goal that the President would be involved (but this is only an educated assumption on my part). Later I saw Karen Hughes of the White House staff but I do not think she was present when Haley made his comments. [/INST] Category: Company Business, Strategy, etc.(elaborate in Section 3 [Topics])"

Public opinion is the pendulum that swings law...dsg August 4 2000 Deregulation Leaves Electricity Market Ripe for Manipulation by Power Firms By REBECCA SMITH and JOHN J. FIALKA Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL It's a market ripe for manipulation: surging demand for an indispensable commodity weak oversight and a chaotic new set of rules amid a transition from heavy regulation to open competition. This is the state of the U.S. electricity business in the summer of 2000. And sure enough there's growing evidence that some power companies are finding lucrative ways to exploit the system -- at consumers' expense. The tactics include manipulating wholesale electricity auctions taking juice from transmission systems when suppliers aren't supposed to and denying weaker competitors access to transmission lines. None of this is illegal and much of it might be considered basic competition. But as an electricity shortage plunges sweltering California into an energy crisis and fears of even worse shortages rattle the Northeast the practices of power suppliers face more scrutiny than ever. (See related article.) Steamy Conditions A hot summer day last year shows one kind of manipulation. On July 28 1999 wholesale electricity prices in the Middle Atlantic states hit $935 per megawatt hour. That was seven times what it costs to generate power at the most expensive plant in the region. An analysis of trading data from that day shows that PECO Energy Corp. and PPL Corp. the old Philadelphia Electric Co. and Pennsylvania Power & Light made the most of steamy conditions. In the region's power market deregulated in 1997 a new corporation called PJM Interconnection LLC runs the transmission system once operated piecemeal by eight utilities. It also operates a daily electricity auction that sorts the hourly bids of 540 generating plants. The cheapest plants are called on first but when the weather is hot and demand is acute higher offers are taken as well. To attract as many bidders as possible the highest bid each hour sets the price for the entire market for that hour. Grid and Bear It Rise in average wholesale electricity prices at key transmission-interconnection points for the month of May from 1997 to 2000. TRANSMISSION-INTERCONNECTION POINT % CHANGE 1997-2000 Texas +293% +216 Tennessee Valley Authority +165 California-Oregon border +162 New York-West +138 Chicago area +130 New England +117 New York-East +101 Upper Midwest +99 Florida +89 Mid-Atlantic region +80* *Includes only years 1999-2000 Source: Federal Energy Regulatory Commission RDI Power What PECO and PPL did was offer much of their output at low prices so that the majority of their plants would be called into service. But knowing demand was so high they offered power from their tiniest plants at vastly higher bids in a way that often set the peak price for a number of hours. Consumers that day ended up paying millions of extra dollars for power. Cases like this show that during the transition to deregulation there's a good argument the system has broken down says William Massey a commissioner at the Federal Energy Regulatory Agency. FERC which polices the nation's bulk power markets began the deregulation movement in 1996. It wasn't supposed to be this way. In the old days utilities generated electricity and delivered it to customers in exclusive territories. To protect consumers from gouging rates were regulated. But while supply had to be able to meet peak demand at all times demand varied widely within regions between regions and from one season to another. The result was tremendous reliability but also inefficiency and waste. Deregulation now under way in half the country and functioning nationally at the wholesale level allows new players -- some affiliated with utilities some not -- to build power plants and sell electricity. Prices are supposed to be set by competitive markets. Risks are borne by investors not ratepayers. At the same time utilities are surrendering control of long-haul transmission lines to new nonprofit operators like the one in the Middle Atlantic region which are supposed to ensure fair access to the grid -- the multistate system of high voltage lines. Under this new regime energy prices should have dropped as companies raced to compete with one another. But the massive U.S. energy infrastructure wasn't designed to serve as the backbone of a free market. On hot summer days when there's little or no surplus electricity in the nation's most populous regions generators can charge prices far in excess of their production costs and be confident they'll get tapped for service by grid operators who must keep the lights on at any cost. Utility holding companies that still control transmission lines have an added advantage: They can effectively lock out cheaper competitors. California Cuts Price Cap for Electricity Once Again (Aug. 2)Price Cap Is Set for Electricity That Is Sold in New England (July 27)PPL KeySpan Say Earnings Surpassed Wall Street Targets (July 27)Energy Trading Internet Operations Help Enron's Net Income Jump 30% (July 25)PG&E Posts 36% Rise in Net to $248 Million (July 21) The new regional grid operators called independent system operators or ISOs eventually will be in charge of preventing manipulation. But as nongovernmental organizations they won't have basic investigative tools like subpoena powers or the ability to impose significant penalties. FERC which does have those powers rarely uses them preferring to let the market discipline itself. A Strange Drop Sometimes it's difficult to know what constitutes an abuse of the market. In July 1999 engineers noticed that a substantial amount of power was being taken from the grid for which there was no explanation. They contacted the North American Electric Reliability Council the industry group charged by Congress with overseeing the grid since the late 1960s. After a lengthy investigation NERC determined that Cinergy Corp. a utility holding company had surreptitiously taken enough power over a three-day period about 9600 megawatt hours to light a small city for a month. Cincinnati-based Cinergy had underestimated power demands. Rather than buy electricity on the open market at ferociously high prices or cut power to Cincinnati it quietly borrowed power from the system when demand was peaking and later replaced it in the cool of the night when demand wasn't so high. James E. Rogers Cinergy's chief executive received a letter from A.R. Garfield the chairman of NERC's regional power-coordination center accusing his company of showing blatant disregard for the rules and of using the grid as a supplemental resource without regard to the reliability or integrity of the system. But Cinergy paid no fine. That's because it runs its own transmission control area and is trusted to enforce NERC's voluntary rules even when it is the violator. Smaller utilities in Cinergy's area by contrast face contractual penalties of as much as $35000 per megawatt for unilaterally borrowing from the grid a practice known as leaning on the ties. Dancing on the Edge? Mr. Garfield is still steamed about Cinergy's actions which he said removed part of the system's essential reserve needed to avoid cascading blackouts or a chain of uncontrollable outages that could darken whole sectors of the country. How fair is it that someone can dance on the edge like that and get away with it? he asks. Mr. Rogers points to old rules that permit utilities to temporarily borrow small amounts of power during emergencies. We were very careful to make sure when we leaned on the ties ... we didn't bring the whole system down he says. Nevertheless he concedes in a competitive world those rules need to be changed. The region's regulators have since gone to FERC for authority to charge borrowers for the market value of the electricity they take off the grid. Leaning on the ties is only one way fair competition is being frustrated on the country's transmission system a vast web of connections that resembles the nation's highway system before the construction of the interstates. While there are plenty of routes to get electricity from outlying power plants directly to big cities there are relatively few routes connecting regions. That makes it possible for some big companies to shut out competitors. A Snag in Transmission St. Louis-based Aquila Energy hit that snag when it tried to use a transmission corridor owned by New Orleans-based Entergy Corp. to move electricity to a buyer in East Texas. Entergy granted the request initially but then it canceled saying it didn't have sufficient space on its lines. Aquila didn't buy it. After analyzing transmission-capacity data the company argued to FERC that Entergy did have enough space on its lines and so was in effect breaking a rule that required it to provide transmission-line access when possible. Without access to Entergy's lines Aquila was forced to compensate the buyer and lost nearly $300000 on the deal. From whom did the Texas customer end up buying the power? A unit of Entergy -- and for a higher price than it would have paid Aquila. FERC said Entergy had been within its rights to restrict access in this case because it had transmission problems. But FERC found that Entergy on other occasions had hoarded transmission capacity that should have been made available to the market. Entergy declines to comment. Such scenarios are costly for consumers and they are among the reasons the electricity industry is enjoying flush times. In the second quarter just ended companies ranging from AES Corp. in Arlington Va. to Enron Corp. in Houston reported huge profit increases some as much as 50%. To be sure a lot of those profits are coming from extraordinary demand growth and a pickup in energy trading. But Sean Murphy president of Southern Energy New England a unit of Southern Cos. Atlanta Ga. worries that the industry has gotten too greedy and risks retribution. Pigs get fat but hogs get slaughtered he says. Tremendous Volatility New federal data show that average wholesale power prices have more than doubled at 14 of 17 key pricing points across the country in the past three years. By May of this year prices had risen across a broad range -- by 89% in Florida for example and by 294% in Texas. But even these increases mask the tremendous volatility that has struck all the major wholesale markets during the past year. In the case of the Midwest where prices in July 1999 hit $9000 per megawatt hour it was as if a $1.89 gallon of gas suddenly sold for $567. Prices like these have prompted growing calls for investigations into whether electric companies are gouging their customers. Some consumer groups lukewarm to deregulation in the first place now are agitating for re-regulation. Residential electricity bills have doubled in San Diego which is notable because it's the first city in the nation to be served by a utility that's buying all of its energy on the competitive market. Politicians are sounding the alarm in the Pacific Northwest. There wholesale prices peaked at a record $1300 per megawatt hour during the last week in June. Energy-intensive industries like mines and aluminum smelters are cutting back on production and temporarily laying off workers. We may be seeing too much opportunism in the market says Montana Gov. Marc Racicot. Demands by Mr. Racicot and his counterpart in Washington Gary Locke were instrumental in prompting FERC to open a national investigation in late July into possible market abuses. A Six-Month Lag One big premise on which deregulation rests is that a free flow of information will let markets police themselves and operate efficiently. But a key tool for market monitoring the data on utility Web sites used to book transmission orders is often unreliable. There's a six-month lag on the release of bidding data which are coded to mask the identities of bidders. What's more the four FERC-controlled ISOs operating in California the Middle Atlantic states New England and New York don't have the authority to compel market participants to give them internal documents like bilateral contracts and other information they don't want to hand over. Without such documents there's a lot more looking than finding says Bill Museler chief executive of the New York ISO. Even if the ISOs do find something problematic there isn't much they can do about it. The tariffs contracts and bylaws under which they operate generally prohibit them from releasing company-specific data and so exposing wrongdoers. And with the exception of California the ISOs' own board meetings are closed to the public. The reality is confidentiality rules protect the guilty says Frank Wolak a professor of economics at Stanford University and chairman of the California ISO's Market Surveillance Committee. And there are no codes of conduct to instill a sense of fair play. That can be a huge problem on hot days. In California an independent exchange runs a daily forward auction in which it tries to match the next day's anticipated demand to bids by generators. But this summer generators often have offered less power than they know will be needed so that they can submit higher bids later when the ISO is forced to pay stiffer prices for emergency power. On occasion ISO engineers have had just 40 minutes to frantically phone around and nail down suppliers knowing that if they fail they could be forced to begin rolling blackouts. The bidding strategy while legal undermines reliability and forces the ISO to do some real gymnastics says Kellan Fluckiger chief operations officer for the California ISO. Generators say they aren't to blame for the mad scramble. Utilities buying power for their customers often order less power than they really need for fear that a big order will drive up the overall market price to prohibitive levels. The only real recourse available to the ISOs is to rewrite the rules governing their local markets. But FERC is reluctant to let them meddle too often because generators are investing billions of dollars based on existing market rules. There's another reason too says Ron Rattey a veteran FERC economist who in June wrote a 10-page internal memo criticizing the agency for not doing more to ferret out unfair conduct. Every single ISO has identified strategic abuses he says. And every time the ISOs make adjustments to the rules the market participants find new ways around them.

Our negative CTC claim was apparently not taken into account in compiling that list. The list is nonbinding however. PG&E will be required to file schedules of creditors on April 20. Our negative CTC claim should be on Schedule F (for unsecured claims). You may want to remind Glynn of your previous conversations and state our expectation that the negative CTC claim will appear (preferably as uncontested) in the April 20 filing. (Note: if PG&E does not include the claim we have an opportunity to file a proof of claim and ultimately the court determines the validity of the claim). Including Enron on the Creditors' Committee: PG&E may have the opportunity to influence representation on the creditors' committees. There are several reasons to suggest to Glynn that we be included: 1) we are a big creditor 2) we could be helpful in crafting a broader solution and 3) we are one of the real parties in interest behind the PX and ISO (who were listed as significant creditors but are really just passthroughs for the suppliers ... and PG&E likely would not want to have those political bodies serving on the creditors committee anyway).

This filing is in response to the language in the FERC San Diego Order which suggested that the FERC believes the CAISO should have this authority. Clearly this raises issues about the role of the CAISO in the forward markets as a policy matter but FERC is likely to approved this authority anyway. The CAISO Board is addressing this matter as part of its Comprehensive Market Reform Project. The CAISO Board at the September 7 meeting deferred the issues of the 2-day ahead market (as well as the policy matter of the CAISO buying forward) until the October meeting. However later during Executive Session the CAISO Board apparently approved Amendment 30. At this point in time IEP is not planning on responding to Amendment 30. This position is primarily driven by limited funds in the Restructuring/Transmission Task Force account and given the forces aligned in support taking this issue up seem problematic. Please let me know if anyone differs with this assessment and would like to see IEP comment (recognizing that funds would be required to accomplish this). ----- Original Message ----- From: Andy Brown <ABB@eslawfirm.com> To: Steven Kelly (E-mail) <steven@iepa.com> Katie Kaplan (E-mail) <kaplan@iepa.com> <smutny@iepa.com> Cc: Douglas Kerner <DKK@eslawfirm.com> Chris Ellison <CTE@eslawfirm.com> Eric Janssen <EricJ@eslawfirm.com> Sent: Monday September 18 2000 3:55 PM Subject: CONFIDENTIAL AND PRIVILEGED ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION > Attached is a memo which briefly describes CAISO's Amendment 30 and a > potential response approach for IEP.

This week has been very quiet on Capitol Hill as all of the members are back in the states on August recess running for re-election and it is a big vacation week for staff...but here's what I am hearing: As you may or may not know we have been been very active this year trying to temper pipeline safety legislation that was fairly reactionary in the wake of last summer's liquid pipeline accident in Bellingham WA. SENATE: In June Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Slade Gorton (R-WA) led the charge to pass a pipeline safety bill (S. 2438) out of the Senate Commerce Committee and that bill is awaiting floor action in the Senate. Because of the hasty way in which S. 2438 was drafted and passed there was a realization by both Republicans and Democrats in the Senate that the bill could not make it to the floor for a vote until some serious changes were made -- mostly things that were deal breakers for industry. Enron and El Paso were leading the charge and we had a number of Senators backing our efforts to negotiate changes including Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-MS) Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) John Breaux (D-LA) and Sam Brownback (R-KS). From what I've learned since the accident these Senators are not changing their strategy and are still asking for the same improvements. Fortunately most of the changes we were looking to make were fairly technical and not the types of things that would be seriously compromised by the accident. Industy was already in the position of having to accept a number of things they never would have if not for he Bellingham incident...the El Paso incident just reinforces those. The biggest potential effect I see from the El Paso accident is an increased effort to pass something before the Congress adjourns in early October. The New Mexico Senators are already calling for a floor vote on the McCain/Gorton legislation and I there will certainly be greater pressure on leaders to wrap up negotiations get agreement from all sides on a bill and move it unanimously through a vote on the Senate floor. HOUSE: The House is moving a bit more slowly but again I'd expect the El Paso situation to expedite things somewhat. There were several bills introduced in the House that were not moving anywhere including an identical copy of the McCain legislation introduced by Rep. Bob Franks (R-NJ). Franks is now anxious to move legislation as he is running for Senate and would love to take credit for helping out on an issue of national visibility. Before the accident House Tranportation Committee leaders on both the Democrat and Republican side were working on a consensus bill that they could introduce in early September and move quickly through the Committee and to the House floor. I'm told that negotiations on that legislation are moving forward and a draft bill will be produced shortly. Unlike our experience in the Senate we have had significant input into the bill in advance and expect something that we can live with -- and something more reasonable than the McCain bill. With that said there may be an effort to expand the bill in a few areas because of the El Paso accident so we'll have to see what kind of hand we're dealt in the next few weeks. Overall I'd expect pipeline safety legislation to be given higher priority when Congress returns after Labor Day. In the absence of this accident I would have given it slim odds of passing in the few short weeks until adjournment with appropriations bills taking up most of Congress' precious time. Now there will be greater pressure to come to consensus and move bills through by an expedited process so that everyone running for election in November can show that they've done something about this terrible tragedy. With that said there's still not that much time to get legislation through so I'd say that there's still a chance it may not get done this year. If I had to attach a number to it I'd say that the El Paso accident improves the chances of legislation going all the way to probably 50-60%. 2) Gas supply to California: I'll have to do some more checking in this area and get back to you. All I've heard so far is that the safety questions that remain may slow the speed of restarting flow on the line notwithstanding that El Paso thinks it can have things running again fairly quickly. I'm sure the power crunch in California will put some counter-pressure on but I just don't have good intelligence on this yet. With all this said I'm on vacation this week and parts of next week finishing up some leave I've taken for the birth of our new baby daughter so I may not have an additional report for you until early to mid next week. If you have questions please respond by e-mail or leave a message on my voice mail at 202-466-9157.

I take full responsibility for approving the hiring of the Hills firm (and I look forward to meeting with you and Carla as we discussed) but remain hopeful we can use their services for something other than WTO. In the wake of Seattle and as I have come to understand better what the WTO can and cannot do for us on the energy services front I have come to the view that our talent and money would be better spent on other activities. My inclination is to do the bare minimum necessary to keep the machine going. If we have specifically committed to certain things then let's follow through. If there are things we can avoid let's avoid them. Specifically with respect to Fischer going to Geneva Why not have him available by phone at all hours to provide assistance and mage that known to USG instead of underwriting additional travel. With respect to the Hills firm can we use the retained time to help with the specific strategies we are now working out for the regions? These are the kinds of things we need to consider. Joe Hillings@ENRON 04/19/2000 04:13 AM To: Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES cc: Subject: Enron and the Energy Services Issue Before The WTO Steve: This is a brief extension of our conversation yesterday afternoon putting in print some of the upcoming dates and possible committments for your consideration and decision. We have no exit strategy at this time and in order to follow your general instructions to withdraw gradually (I'm not quite certain that is possible at this stage) you need to know the following. The April meeting at the WTO in Geneva (Committee on Specific Committments) spent considerable time discussing how energy services would be considered in the WTO GATS (General Agreement on Trade and Services) . The USTR raised the issue tabled the issue and guided the discussion. We did not send anyone to that session. As planned for several months we issued the Rachel Thompson study which is completing its basic distribution now. There has already been considerable interest in the study and I fully expect it to generate discussion in the days ahead. I have sent you the correspondence from the Japanese Ministry. Tonight I am hosting a small dinner for the top staff person for the leading Japanese business organization affiliated with the CSI organization. He raised the issue of Japan's industry feeling energy services was going too fast too soon when Ken addressed the WTO Ministerial Forum last December in Seattle. Now he has told Bob Vastine president of CSI that he was told later by his collegues that his statement was a misstatement. We'll hear more tonight. Later today the ESC Executive Committee is meeting with the DOE to discuss how they can support energy services for the USTR who has lacked technical advisers since Donna Bobbich and Russ Profozich left DOE earlier this year. DOE has appointed a group to help USTR and this is an orientation meeting held at their request. Next week I have scheduled the first ESC full meeting since January to update members (now 50 since Schlumberger joined on Friday) on developments which is essentially a report by USTR Carol Balassa who is the responsible official handling energy services. She has given a couple of us a debriefing on what happened at the WTO meeting and a request to prepare more detailed information for the May 10 meeting in Geneva where she tells us that energy services will be even more involved in the discussion. We should have Bob Fisher go to that meeting to be of assistance. This is a decision point for you. We have made some other committments which are also decision points although the Helsinki meeting on June 18th has been agreed upon based on my feelings that when I discussed it (the SCO/FSN Showcase Europe) in Houston with you and Rick you raised no objection which I took as agreeing that it should go forward. We have done this meeting annually where I have brought in someone from Enron companies to brief them and host them for dinner. These are the commercial people in the US embassies throughout Europe and the former Soviet Union. They are important points of contact for our commercial people. This year they want to have energy services in the WTO and as we would like them to exist in their territory. A few members of the ESC Executive Committee will do the former and Peter Styles the later. I have organized the dinner. Following that meeting is one that EC Trade staffer Uta Klinkers wants the ESC Executive Committee to put on in Brussels which is a joint meeting she is organizing with European energy industry representatives. This is a dialogue on energy services. The EU is an important player in the WTO and Uta who recently met with the ESC Executive Committee in Washington is quite supportive of liberalized energy services. At the EC she reports directly to Commissioner Pascal Lamy. Rick's memo this week suggested we have Peter Styles do this briefing. Peter is not an American and is not affiliated with the ESC. Therefore unless we participate Europe's energy industry is not talking with US industry. If this is what you want then I should tell Uta that we are unable to do the meeting. The last meeting is the presentation by Ken Lay at the OECD Forum 2000 on June 26 which I engineered with Doug Worth Secretary General of the BIAC (Business Industry Affairs Committee) to the OECD. This is a major world conference and Ken is addressing e-commerce and services. Doug an American and former head of the Washington IBM office wants to have Ken meet with OECD Commissioners in a smaller meeting to discuss trends for the future. I had planned to be there with Ken for the day day and a half he will be in Paris. I introduced our company to the OECD several years ago and it has become increasingly involved in issues of interest to us. Well these are the near-term items that require your fine hand if we are to proceed. A dramatic drop off at this time will have its effects and no one is likely to pick up our leadership. There is growing support for what has been accomplished and the USG plus others are now hooked on the energy services agenda. I cannot easily see an exit strategy that can do anything but cause criticism at this point. This is definately a longer term committment that I thought we had made when approval was given to hire the Hills firm. However if you want to exit other than pulling back from the Brussels meeting I think the other meetings are firm committements at this point. These are some thoughts for your consideration and decision. Joe [/INST] Category: Company Business, Strategy, etc.(elaborate in Section 3 [Topics])"

Wood's two-day hearing on Wholesale Markets which concluded today (8/24) in San Diego. Three Commissioner's were present (Wood Lynch and Neeper) with Duque and Bilas participating by phone. Administrative Law Judge Wetzel was present and a transcript was taken. The quasi-legislative hearing was the beginning of a record developed for the investigation into the workings of wholesale/retail markets. This session focused on Wholesale markets. There will be subsequent sessions on retail issues market structure and other related issues in the future. My conclusion from this session is that Wood is looking for support for increasing regulatory intervention in the market. Dan Larcamp Director of the Office of markets Tariffs and Rates FERC was present. He relayed FERC's concern of this matter and a desire to hold hearings in San Diego. He also relayed that Hoecker held a press conference announcing the opening of a 206 investigative proceeding into the operation of the wholesale markets in California which carried with it refund authority. The format of the hearing was to respond to pre-filed questions developed by Wood/Lynch. Each member of the panel would respond to the questions and any questions posed by the Commissioners the Judge or the CPUC Attorney. No questions were posed by members of the audience. Yesterday's panel of academics were comprised of: 1. Dr. Timothy Duane-UC Berkley 2. Dr. William Hogan-Harvard 3. Dr. Frank Wolak-Stanford (ISO Market Surveillance Committee) 4. David Marcus-Energy Consultant for the Coaltion of Utility Employees 5. Dr. Gene Coyle 6. Dr. Jean-Michel Glachant Universite Paris I Pantheon Sorbonne The panel was asked to speak as individuals and not on behalf of any institutions they may represent. While the purpose of the panel seemed to be to determine that market power was being exercised and that prices were too high and therefore not just and reasonable the panelist stopped short of blaming generators and market participants in behaving illegally. The concensus generally was that market power did exist at various times but the mere existence did not constitute bad behavior. None with the exception of Dr. Wolak who is in the process of doing a study using recent data as part of his role for the Market Surveillance Committee had done a study. There was some discussion though not much of the monopsony power of the utilities. I think ultimately the group conceded that scarcity of supply amplified concerns about the exercise of market power as even the increase in gas costs did not fully explain the recent spikes. Wolak believes that encourage utilities to enter into forward purchases will reduce the exercise of real-time market power. Hogan seemed to be there with Sempra's interests in mind. He continued to promote expansion of the ISO's abilities to dispatch load as well as maintain system reliability. There was alot of discussion about forward purchase ability for utilities so as to be less subject to volatile market prices. The concerns were also discussed about the appropriateness of a distribution utility making purchasing decisions on behalf of its customers. This included discussion of separation of these functions and the default provider role. Most everyone agreed that rolling back to a regulated market was not feasible without raising other major and serious concerns however there seemed to be support for some interim measures where cost-of-service regulation may be a good idea and that was during peak periods. All agreed that a demand response and price signals are important in the long-run although not to the extent currently experienced in San Diego. Today's panel included representatives from SDG&E SCE and PG&E TURN UCAN and ORA. While yesterday's panel maintained objectivity as to whether or not generators were exercising market power to the detriment of the system today's panel made no bones about the generators being to blame. SCE/PG&E indicated their need for relief for recovery of market costs in excess of the rate freeze. SDG&E was still on the hot seat for their inaction in hedging any of their supply. SDG&E brought up their failed PBR proposal and ORA and UCAN thought that that may be one way to incent the utility to be more responsible with their purchases. UCAN discussed the Governor's direction and the potential for putting rate caps into affect for residential and small commercial. He mentioned that C&I customers are experience difficulties as well. TURN raised the need for cost-based bid caps and cost-based peaking contracts. Mike Florio TURN urged against any further divestitute of assets and alleged market concentration on those assets that had been divested. In fact TURN urged the Commission to seek legislation to clarify the Commission's authority to order retention of assets. Neeper urged that part of the solution should be changing the current requirement to use the PX as the only authorized exchange although TURN disagreed.

Good new - The Williamson Act passed the Senate 34-1 It should be heard at the assembly Saturday or Monday if it is not redirected to a Committee hearing. 2. There was a long meeting with Ducheny with regards to AB 970. The enviro's boycotted they want to draft a bill with Keeley. Labor was obstructionist - they wanted to gut all the expediting siting language with regards to all facilities except for the peaking plants. Rate Cap related bills 1. The Edison Language on Rate Stabilization may not go anywhere. Edison has not found an author because of the efforts of Enron and others lobbying against it. Furthermore there are signs that Gov. Davis opposes it. 2. The Governor's office has issued a proposed language for a rate cap bill. The language however is not available as of yet. It may be released today or tomorrow. SDG&E has shown concerns over the content of the bill. They seem to think that it is worse than initially proposed by the Governor in his press release. The bill includes retroactive rate caps through 6/1/00. The rate cap could reflect Wood's rate cap proposal (6.5 cts cap on the energy component The bill does not specify who or how the costs associated with the cap will be recovered. (The reasoning is that UDCs will be more cautious in their procurement if there is uncertainty on who is responsible for the costs.) All of this is speculative. We hope to see the actual language soon. 3. Enron has been working with the Republican leadership to promote a rate cap proposal similar to the amended language we have proposed for AB2290. The bill focuses only on SDG&E customers and our major principals are the following. The Interim Rate Cap should be limited to residential and small commercial customers plus specific institutions that have a significant public role such as schools and hospitals. The Interim Rate Cap should be limited to the period ending December 31 2001. The Interim Rate Cap must be structured so that any undercollection is eventually recovered from the same customers who benefit from the lower rates provided by the rate cap.

Enron entities were NOT named in exhibit B. This is not to say that we could not be easily added to the group. While the motion reads as if the CPUC was moving against everybody in fact in footnote 2 they state they are only moving against the entities named in Exhibit B.

Unfortunately I was engaged in discussions about the course to pursue in light of Arthur Anderson's comments until almost 10pm when I lost my typing help so not much headway was made in inputting the changes last night. My secretary is supposed to be in early ( it is now nearly 8:00 and she still isn't in ! ) and I will enlist whatever other help I can get to turn these documents around. For those not involved in the discussions last night Roger advised us that Arthur Anderson had changes to the Xonon Technology Implementation Agreement designed to make clear ENA had no primary or secondary obligations under the XTIA. The principal change suggested by AA - the deletion of the last sentence of the BOLD language in Section 2.2 - removed the obligation for ENA to pick up any obligations under the agreement owed by West LB in excess of the Cap. Note that this same change applies in the Agreement in Principle related to the purchase of turbines. XTIA Revision 4G. AA's change did not appear to address comprehensively the principle AA espoused ie clarifying ENA had no primary or secondary obligations under the agreements. After much discussion and some consideration I decided to prepare alternative markups of the XTIA - one that attempts to meet the AA directive while preserving a level of comfort for GE. I attempted this by increasing the limit on West LB's liability in Article 10 to $20 million from $9.9 million so that GE's recourse against West LB is the same as it had against West LB and ENA in the prior drafts and by obligating West LB in the default provisions to pony up for an ENA default. I also extensively modified the Section 2.2 language ( taken verbatim from the LM 6000 deal ) to eliminate the limited recourse provisions favoring West LB and in doing so made it easier to conclude that references to ENA in the agreement are references to ENA acting in an agency and not its individual capacity. This notion is still pretty vague in the revision because I did not want to create too much discomfort in GE since ENA explicitly acting in an agency capacity would mean there was no recourse against it ( since ultimate recourse would lie with the principal West LB). Roger suggested I delete the limit on ENA's liability in Article 10 to remove the implication it had any which I did ( and which means we have no upside protection if we are construed to have obligations under the XTIA. The upshot is that in my opinion the 4g revision goes as far as possible toward placating AA while still retaining a possibility of selling it to GE. The sheer number of changes required by the substance of AA's comment however is bound to be disconcerting to GE at this stage of negotiations particularly when GE's expectation was for a markup incorporating the new business terms agreed yesterday afternoon (calling for payment of the Development Funds to be completed by September 302000 with the possibility of a refund of a portion of the Development Fund Payment if the December 31 Milestone is not timely completed) and some clean ups/clarifications. Note that in both revision 4g and 4ga Section4.3 now provides that the Xonon credit created is only exercisable by CCSI on and after December 312000 so that the credit amount can reflect the deduction of any Milestone 4 refund amount paid by GE if it does not complete that Milestone on time. I think the dollar value of the credit should be adjusted downward if a portion of the Development Funds paid on September 30 are in fact refunded in December. We need to make sure to make provision in the Acquisition and Development Agreement that any Milestone 4 refund received by West LB is paid over to ENA since West LB will have been repaid its advances on September 302000. XTIA Revision 4GA . This alternate revision to the XTIA takes a minimalist approach and incorporates only the new business terms some minor clean up/clarifications and the AA change to Section 2.2 and the change to Article 10 ( to remove a cap for ENA's laibility) suggested by Roger. It seems to me it does not address meaningfully the AA admonition that ENA may not have primary or secondary liability under the XTIA if it wants to stay outside of the rigors of FAS 97-10. However it has the singular advantage of looking a lot like what GE and West LB expect to see in the revision. Option Repurchase Agreement. This revision was complicated by the possible refund of the a portion of the Development Funds by GE if it failed to complete Milestone 4 by December 312000 ( an attempt to retain some accountability for GE's performance given that it is being paid for that Milestone on September 30 to satisfy CCSI ). Because the option repurchase must occur on or before September 30 it isn't clear what will happen December 31 so its hard to figure out what to pay if the contract is not cancelled by September 30 or what the credits are worth on that date. Since CCSI is the direct recipient of the credits under the XTIA I first thought ENA could hang onto $2.1 million ( the amount formerly allocated to Milestone 4 before its payment obligation was collapsed into Milestone 3) by deducting the refund from the amount payable to CCSI on the option repurchase date and leaving CCSI to bear the risk of GE's repayment of any refund in order to make CCSI whole. If GE did meet the Milestone on time and so did not pay the refund amount directly to CCSI I thought ENA could always make CCSI whole by paying the $2.1 million in December when the refund matter was decided. That approach- subtracting the refund amount from the September 30 payment to CCSI- was decidedly unsatisfactory since the option repurchase formula could result - depending on the Milestones paid on the option repurchase date - in a negative payment to CCSI for the option. What I settled on in this draft was to go ahead and pay CCSI the amount of the premiums it has paid to September 30 plus $200000 if the turbine contract has not been cancelled on September 30. This would include repayment to CCSI on September 30 of premiums paid by CCSI under the spark spread on September 30. Assuming CCSI made all its premium payments and West LB made all of its Development Fund advances ENA would have received $9.9 million from CCSI by September 30 paid out $9.9 million plus interest to West LB by September 30 and purchased the spark spread from CCSI for $10.1 million. If the turbine contract is not cancelled but GE has to pay the refund I think the $2.1 million ought to go to West LB or its designee (ENA). If we cancel the turbine contract and do not go forward with Pastoria the dollar amount of the credits vested in CCSI and exercisable after December 312000 are equal to the Development Funds advanced less the refund amount. Since the document now reads that the $2.1 refund amount goes back to West LB or its designee if GE pays the refund and CCSI is holding a Xonon credit of only $7.8 millionit seems to me it will be necessary to pay the refund over to CCSI instead of ENA in order to make up for the fact that it paid $9.9 in premium and only received $7.8 in credit in September. This quick liquidation of $2.1 of the credit seems to be an ancillary benefit to CCSI occasioned by GE's refund. We could provide in the agreements that GE makes this payment directly to CCSI or we can continue to have the right to receive the payment from GE under the XTIA and the obligation to pay it to CCSI under the Repurchase Agreement.

The only problem I see is that we would need a decision from the top that we're not going to turn the customers back if we get direct access (so we can end the debate). I don't think it helps us if we get lucky get direct access back then make a decision to return customers to the utility.

I strongly believe that the public hit we will take will be far greater than our actual out-of-pocket losses. We will be crucified by the public media consumer groups legislators governor attorney general etc. and this action will reaffirm our reputation of packing up and leaving when it's not in our interest. The impact of this action would be exacerbated since it is on the heels of UC/CSU. I would also argue that this hurts our national dereg efforts. If we're advocating that competition and choice benefits consumers and then we turn around and pull out of a market and abandon customers when we're not profiting we'll kill any chances we have of ever serving retail customers in California -- or in any other state. We look foolish advocating for direct access when we're not willing to serve our existing -- let alone future customers What about a preemptive strike that engages these 16000 customers to weigh in on direct access -- i.e. a letter that says Enron may be forced to cancel its contract -- call/write/send the enclosed postcard to your legislator and tell them you want to keep your right to choose your energy service provider. Our credibility is on the line. Before we take this action we need to be cognizant of all the long-range strategic implications and we need to seriously weigh the negative impact this will have on our corporate reputation on our legislative abilities and on our commercial success going forward. kd James D Steffes 04/12/2001 09:05 PM To: Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT Sandra McCubbin/NA/Enron@Enron Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron Janel Guerrero/Corp/Enron@Enron Mark Palmer/Corp/Enron@ENRON Karen Denne/Corp/Enron@ENRON Susan J Mara/NA/Enron Peggy Mahoney/HOU/EES@EES Harry Kingerski/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Dan Leff/HOU/EES@EES Subject: CONFIDENTIAL - Residential in CA In the meeting today no decision was made about what to do with Enron's 16000 residential customers.

Doug Schuler <schuler@rice.edu> on 05/01/2001 10:59:10 AM To: skean@enron.com cc: Subject: my work situation Dear Steve Jim and Rick: I just wanted to give you a quick update on my situation at Rice and to inquire as to a future project with your group at Enron. First I apologize for my prolonged recent absences. I have had two long-standing academic projects: one was due 4/19 (it was on final review - a paper about corporate political strategy - and just was accepted for publication at our top academic journal) and another is due 5/31. The 5/31 paper was commissioned long ago but is a key paper in a June conference (topic is methods to study corporate political activities and the public affairs function). In order to get it done properly I need to forego any work at Enron until later in the month. A project of interest to me at Enron - and I hope one that you also have interest - is assessing the effectiveness of governmental affairs. John told me that he conducted such a study for the group last year. One of the methodological challenges is to calculate the benefits that government affairs brings - especially in a system where for example on the legislative side much of the work of government affairs is to block legislation at very early stages. I suspect that govt. affairs needs to justify its existence for internal budgets at Enron and thus the benefits of the function are important to quantify. I'd like to review any of the previous work and make suggestions as necessary. At some point let me know how you would like to proceed. Otherwise I hope all is well with you all.

This time my desk drawer key has been stolen from its hiding place under my telephone. I *always* lock my drawers and keep the key in the same place but on arriving in the office today I found the drawers unlocked and the key missing. Although there's nothing sensitive on or around my desk I'm concerned about the security implications of someone sniffing around the office in this manner. I also found the papers on my desk extensively reshuffled last week. Last year in our old office I had my only two real options books stolen from among the many and varied books on my desk. That couldn't have been a random theft and I fear this isn't either. I can't understand who'd be so interested in a Research guy's belongings! Can we ask security to check their surveillance footage for any suspicious activity around my desk?
