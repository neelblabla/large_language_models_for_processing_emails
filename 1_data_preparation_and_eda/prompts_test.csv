Subject:: CONFIDENTIAL - Tennessee political contributions
Body:: Barbara, short of me coming up with the money, it will be next to impossible to get this out of either the trading or origination group. As a significant contributor to the PAC and Enron's other adventures, I don't have the room. Personally, I also have difficulty making campaign contributions so closely linked to specific legislation or policy. This may not be the answer you want; however, I am all ears if you have any ideas on raising these funds. Regards Delainey ---------------------- Forwarded by David W Delainey/HOU/ECT on 10/18/2000 06:42 PM --------------------------- Barbara A Hueter@EES 10/18/2000 01:00 PM To: ddelain2@enron.com cc: Richard.Shapiro@enron.com Subject: CONFIDENTIAL - Tennessee political contributions On September 29th I sent you an email regarding requests for personal political contributions to Tennessee lawmakers. If you or any others intend to make contributions they need to be handled as soon as possible. The election is less than 3 weeks away and the campaigns are making final decisions on media spending. Attached is a recent plea from our lobbying firm in Nashville. The reason contributions must be personal in Tennessee is because state law prohibits contributions from corporations and from political action committees that receive financial support from corporations (Enron Corp. supports the Enron PAC by paying its expenses such as employee time, office materials, etc...). Tennessee is one of the few states to implement such a stringent campaign finance law. The decision on whether or not to provide support for key legislators is up to the business units with interests in Tennessee. If you need further information or would like to discuss this, you can reach me at 614-760-7472 or 614-306-4359 (cell). ---------------------- Forwarded by Barbara A Hueter/DUB/EES on 10/18/2000 01:45 PM --------------------------- ""WILLIAM BRUCE"" on 10/16/2000 09:24:40 PM To: <bhueter@enron.com> cc: <ben.jacoby@enron.com>, <jordan.mintz@enron.com>, ""Gif THORNTON"" ""Robert Gowan"" Subject: CONFIDENTIAL - Tennessee political contributions Barbara, we are getting tremendous pressure for contributions in these last days before the election. As I have mentioned to you, Enron has been referred to specifically by one of the most powerful Senators. Also, Lt. Gov. Wilder's campaign chairman called me in the latter part of last week, hoping for significant financial help for end-of-campaign TV buys. Gif Thornton, Robert Gowan, and I are participating heavily; I cannot overemphasize the importance of Enron's participation. The state ""money crunch"" which existed this past year likely will be worse when the General Assembly reconvenes (tax collections are coming in below estimates), and all existing tax exemptions will be at significant risk. Please do what you can to get some Enron assistance for the candidates which we have discussed now. Thanks. Bill William R. Bruce wbruce@stokesbartholomew.com Stokes Bartholomew Evans & Petree, P.A.

Subject:: India
Body:: Want to pass on some info on India from a conversation last night with Brenda Meisner, a lawyer at Verner, Liipfert, etc. (Saw her at the NRSC quarterly dinner). As you know, her firm represents the Government of India. She initiated the conversation on India and our issues there, saying something to the effect that the firm has told the Indian government how important Enron is and how close Ken is to the White House. They also told the Embassy that the issue would NOT likely come up in the Bush meeting with the PM since the Finance Minister will be in town for World Bank meetings and they assumed it would come up at that level. I said I was not handling the issue. She said the firm would be open to trying to work out the issue or help with same in bringing the two sides together. Also reminded me that Sen. Dole is at the firm. All I said on substance was that certainly India understood the importance of this issue on the foreign investment climate there. FYI. John

Sarah-Joy and I had a detailed follow-on conversation today about this topic, and we're in agreement as to how things can move forward. I'd definitely like to have Bill rejoin our conversation with our new overall commercial contact at HP, whose name Greg Pyle and Bill Lovejoy will supply in the very near future. I understand that Peter Goebel was quite clear with HP in today's meetings regarding the imminent nature of his wireless decision, the breadth of vendors with whom he could conceivably do business, and the fact that the wireless deal and the Enron sell side are inextricably linked. Sarah-Joy mentioned that Gerry has not been present in the more recent conversations, which we're taking to indicate that Bill and Greg understand that his focus was different than ours. Sarah-Joy has brought immense focus and organization to this process. I have certainly found her involvement invaluable. Patrick Matt Harris 12/14/00 10:51 AM To: Sarah-Joy Hunter/NA/Enron@ENRON cc: Dale Clark/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Jennifer Medcalf/NA/Enron@Enron, Patrick Tucker/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Peter Goebel/NA/Enron@Enron Subject: Re: HP -- confidential internal document This is an excellent update. Thanks for putting this together. Dale/Patrick - lets regroup on how we want to move this onward. Seems like SJ's suggestion of our spending more time with Bill Dwyer is a good one. Thanks Matt Sarah-Joy Hunter@ENRON 12/12/00 02:42 PM To: Matt Harris/Enron Communications@Enron Communications cc: Patrick Tucker/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Peter Goebel/NA/Enron@Enron, Dale Clark/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Jennifer Medcalf/NA/Enron@Enron Subject: HP -- confidential internal document Matt: As GSS Business Development transitions the HP relationship for broadband to your team, there are several issues I wanted to clarify in terms of how the relationship has been developed and who the contacts have been to date. Additionally, I outlined the discussion points/action items from this morning's meeting you held with Jennifer Medcalf and myself. Per your request, the HP presentation complete with a listing of HP's business partners was e-mailed to you this morning. HP contacts to date: Bill Lovejoy, Western Gulf Area Sales Manager Houston, TX #(713)-439-5587 (Gerry Cashiola's boss) Gerry Cashiola, sales representative Houston, TX #(713)-439-5555 (To date, HP person coordinating the relationship--seeking a short term play) Greg Pyle, Solution Control Manager Southeast Region Austin, TX (#(512)-257-5735 (Pyle has been playing the business developer role but continues to defer leadership of the process to Gerry Cashiola) Daniel Morgridge, Manager of Internet - E-Services long term alliances Austin, TX #(512)-257-5736 (Interested in E-services/wireless longer term alliances) Bill Dwyer, Chief Architect, e-Services Solutions Cupertino, CA #(408)-447-5240 (To date, clearly the most knowledgeable person on HP's business propositions; strong technical, financial background to craft value propositions. Gerry Cashiola and Greg Pyle deferred to his judgement in the 11/16th meeting) Matt, On November 10th, GSS Business Development took HP through a tour of Enron's trading floor, the gas control center, and the peaking power plant unit center on the trading floor. This tour was one meeting, amongst several, held in October and November to provide HP a full overview of Enron's products and services and introduce them to appropriate contacts at Enron (EBS, GSS buy side -- Peter Goebel). On November 16th GSS Business Development, Patrick Tucker, and Dale Clark outlined 3 possible EBS/HP focus areas -- connectivity, storage, and wireless. Three EBS action items were defined in that meeting: 1) HP was to provide an HP contact on connectivity (to date, Gerry Cashiola has stalled on providing this). Sarah-Joy will continue to pursue this information and get a sense from Gerry Cashiola of what he means by short term opportunity. What is HP's time horizon for short term? 2) EBS and GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call on Storage with Ravi to explore size and potential scope of opportunity (completed 12/8) 3) GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call with Peter Goebel, GSS IT Sourcing Portfolio Leader (set for 12/14) In conversations with you, Jennifer Medcalf and myself this morning, several decisions on forward-looking strategy with HP/EBS were confirmed: Gerry Cashiola has been unable to take control of the process. More importantly, despite numerous visits to Enron in which he has had overviews of Enron's products and services; met with Peter Goebel and his team on the GSS buy side, and participated in an Experience Enron tour, Gerry has been unable to define an HP business proposition. The coordination between Cashiola (short term initiative) Morgridge (long term, 12-24 months) has remained unorganized. These initiatives need to be developed separately. Clearly, the conversations with HP need to be elevated to a more senior level so EBS can work with HP decision makers who can move the relationship forward at a strategic level. As the relationship is developed at this strategic level, shorter term opportunities will crop up along the way. But Gerry's short term plans will not be the focus of the EBS/HP relationship, rather a by-product. To facilitate this process of elevating the relationship, Jennifer Medcalf and I are following up with Bill Lovejoy and Greg Pyle. Lovejoy's boss is Dan Sytsma, VP of HP's America's Central Region. In the conference call Thursday, 12/14 with Peter Goebel and HP regarding wireless initiatives, Peter will support the GSS/BD push for the HP/EBS initiative by reiterating the following two points: a) Enron is already an HP customer; the onus is on HP to move forward on the process of building a strategic relationship (IBM and Lexmark are only some of the HP competitors who could push them out of the running) b) HP's ability to bring the right people to the table will influence HP's business relationship process with Enron Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark could build their relationship with Bill Dwyer, Chief Architect e-Services Solutions, (met at the meeting 11/16) in the near term. Perhaps, plan a visit to Cupertino, California to see Dwyer in person. We look forward to continuing close collaboration with your team on this and other opportunities.

There are a few efforts that are going on simultaneously and I thought it would be a good idea for all of us to meet and get on the same page. As many of you might know, Enron Wind (Michael Payne) and ENA (Mike Curry) have a great proposal to retire renewable energy credits from our Enron Wind facility to match the consumption of the building and stadium (details attached below). If this proposal goes forward, Enron would be the 1st Fortune 500 company to ""go green"" in its headquarters building. Couple this w/ our energy star award, and we have GREAT environmental messaging. We'd like to highlight this announcement on Earth Day (April 22nd). The facilities folks are interested in switching from Reliant to EES for actual commodity. It makes sense to work strategically together on win-win proposal that will not only make sense economically, but that we can use in our messaging. The focus of the meeting is to discuss the various proposals, and steps for moving forward. The meeting will be in EB50MO3 from 2:00-3:00. Please let me know if you or someone from your group can attend. Stacey Bolton Environmental Strategies Enron Corp 3-9916

Jim Susan M Landwehr 02/28/2001 11:10 PM To: Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Linda Robertson/NA/Enron@ENRON cc: Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT, Janel Guerrero/Corp/Enron@Enron, Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron, Mark Palmer/Corp/Enron@ENRON Subject: Western Governors update All---here's an update on what we've been doing with the Governors. Should I be putting Steve Kean on these email updates? As you all know, there were several governors events over the past 3 to 4 days in Washington DC: Paul and I met with Steve Reynolds from Wyoming Gov Geringer's office. They would like us to put forward the name of an Enron individual that could participate in an Energy council that is being formed (actually commissioned by the legislature) to study energy issues for the state. Geringer would also like to come to Houston to learn about our vision in moving from an assets based to a market based entity. We had contacted Scott Cealy (spelling) with Arizona Governor Hull's office last week and Paul sat with Gov Hull at the RGA dinner on Monday night and had a chance to thank her for her leadership in opposing price caps. Mr. Cealy left me a voice mail this afternoon basically inviting us to come to see them. I will schedule that meeting (boy that Paul must have been charming at dinner!!!) I sat with Gary Smith, political guy with Gov Kempthorne's office who indicated that Kempthorne was scheduled to meet with Vice Pres Cheney on Tuesday afternoon. Gov Kitzhaber was also scheduled to attend the meeting with Cheney, but there was speculation that he may not come. I have not confirmed the outcome of that meeting, but was invited by Mr. Smith to call him once they get back to Idaho tommorrow. I will place that call and see what I can find out. Mr. Racicot was going to get back to us on what he found out from Kempthorne---has Linda or Rick heard from him? I will be continueing outreach with Gary Smith on as routine a basis is acceptable to him. We have committed to an RGA event in Aspen Colorado on March 30 that Governor Owens is sponsoring. Paul and I continue to keep in touch with Gov Owens staff. As most of you know from previous updates, Owens is strong in his support against price caps and market based solutions. At our meeting with Racicot on Monday in DC Paul requested some assistance from him in setting up a meeting with Kitzhaber. Linda--how do we want to follow up on that request? Rick and Paul met with Gov Gary Locke on Tuesday and while they disagreed with Lockes position, the discussion was civil and at least left the door open to future discussions. Rick and Paul will manage this relationship for now. We have not has great success in meeting with Leavitt. I will continue to work on setting that up. Guinn has also not been extremely receptive to meeting with us and Paul and I will look at how/whether we continue to knock on that door. We are not actively looking to meet with Montana due to some commercial reasons. There are a number of other ongoing actions (WGA contacts, providing info, etc), but the above update should give everybody the highlights.

Subject:: Re: Phoenix/Equilon Deal; CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY/CLIENT
 COMMUNICATION AND ATTORNEY'S WORK PRODUCT
Body:: Stan: I understand completely, and we will do our very best to achieve your desired approach. The problem is this: Regardless of what the MOU says, we will have to go through a size/probability analysis on this deal. The deal is clearly material to EOTT. From an SEC perspective, the duty to disclose a pending deal depends upon how material the transaction is and how likely it is to occur. If a deal is very material, a lower degree of probability is needed before disclosure is required. The MOU itself is not totally determinative, although signing a document which looks like an LOI will increase the chances of having to disclose. In the present case, if Equilon's Board gives the go- ahead to deal with us exclusively, I feel there would be at least a 20% chance of closing a transaction (based upon past dealings with these folks). Accordingly, if/when that happens, we will need to take a hard look at the disclosure issue. We do not want to disclose prematurely, but I am pretty sure that this deal would be considered ""material,"" and if we go forward with Equilon, I believe that we will need to disclose it at some point prior to closing (certainly after signing a PSA). We can delay disclosure for a period of time for legitimate business reasons, and the MOU we sign may not rise to the level of an LOI, but at some point---if we go forward with Equilon---we are going to reach a point where the size and probability of the deal will mandate disclosure. We don't need to make a decision at this point, we just need to be aware of these circumstances and manage the process accordingly. From a different perspective, we want to sign some kind of LOI with Equilon as soon as we feel comfortable doing so because we want the HSR waiting period to begin running. Equilon wants to close by November 1st. Please advise if you wish to discuss further. Thanks. SWD Stanley Horton@ENRON Sent by: Cindy Stark@ENRON 07/12/2000 02:04 PM To: Steve Duffy/Houston/Eott@EOTT cc: Subject: Re: Phoenix/Equilon Deal; CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY/CLIENT COMMUNICATION AND ATTORNEY'S WORK PRODUCT Steve: Let's start thinking about how we could structure the MOU so we wouldn't have to disclose the deal. I would rather not disclose a ""tentative deal"". Stan From: Steve Duffy@EOTT on 07/11/2000 01:47 PM To: Dana Gibbs, Lori Maddox/Houston/Eott@Eott, Stanley Horton/Corp/Enron@Enron cc: Joe Richards, rbaird@velaw.com, Susan Ralph Subject: Phoenix/Equilon Deal; CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY/CLIENT COMMUNICATION AND ATTORNEY'S WORK PRODUCT Joe R. will be sending out something in greater detail shortly, but it appears that Equilon's management would like to pursue a deal with us on an exclusive basis and that this decision is being forwarded to the Equilon Board for approval. If this acquisition goes forward, we will need to get organized---in the near term---on a number of logistical/due diligence tasks, but one thing we should start thinking about now is the ""disclosure"" issue. If the Equilon Board gives the go-ahead for Equilon to pursue this transaction , Equilon will probably want to sign a memorandum of understanding with us, and this may put us in a ""disclosure"" posture because at that point, we would be looking at a $65 million deal (approx.) with a closure probability of no less than 20% (in my judgment, based upon our past dealings with these people). Even without a signed document, the ""size/probability"" test would still be an issue for us to deal with. Everyone should be thinking about this issue as we await word from Equilon's Board. Thanks.

Should be ""of"" page 6: We need the RR for PG&E. Under Part VII, Rate Design, can we insert a sentence that our proposal, unlike the others, does not arbitrarily allocate costs to peak period. We told Scott we wuold insert the arbitrariness of other proposals several times in the brief. We also need ro insert discussion about relation of peak to offpeak prices, as a 3:2 ratio, which is not what other parties have proposed. page 8: 2. Derivation of Threshold Usage:, first sentence, delete ""between"" in first sentence. page 9: Second full paragraph, begining ""Again, the UDS's, "" Second sentence, sited should be ""cited"" p. 12: First full paragraph beginning ""A primary component,"" Insert a sentence after the second sentence to mention, again, the arbitrariness of proposals allocatin costs between peak and offpeak. Second full parag, beginning, ""Enron's proposal, can stick a sentence about arbitrariness in there too. And change ""more necessary goal"" in 4th sentence to ""more critical goal"" I don't have the email I sent out about what we agreed to insert with Scott, so if you have a chance, check it to make sure we did everything we agreed to. I am going to try to come into the office very early tomorrow and will check email again, but my son has an appointment with the neurologist here in Houston at 9:20 am tomorrow, and that is where I will be when you have the 9:30 call (we made this appointment months ago).

CASE SETTING: 2000, U.S. In October 2000, the chief financial officer of Pacific Northwest Electric (PNW) is considering whether to use weather derivatives to reduce the weather-related risk in the volume of megawatt hours (MWh) sold. The (A) case may be used to stimulate student discussion of how the derivative contracts work, why one might want or not want to take such a contract, and how one would decide whether to use the weather protection. No prior exposure to options or derivatives is needed for this discussion; indeed, the case may be used as an introduction to options. The (B) case involves valuing the available contracts and deciding, which, if any, is the best contract for PNW. Spreadsheet simulation can be used to determine the probability distribution of the payout of the contract and the probability distribution for the net operating contribution including the contract payout, which is the basis for comparing alternatives. It is instructive for the students to think about what would be the ideal contract to reduce exposure to the greatest intent. This pushes students towards the optimal hedge ratio. Specific learning objectives of these cases include these: - to expose students to the cutting edge in financial innovation - to illustrate the use of options to reduce business risk - to challenge the students to value options where the Black-Scholes model cannot be used, and simulation can be readily employed - to experience the perspective of top management in risk management activities.

Subject:: possible RTP conference
Body:: ---------------------- Forwarded by Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT on 03/12/2001 05:17 PM --------------------------- Hill Huntington <hillh@stanford.edu> on 03/01/2001 04:29:29 PM To: vkamins@enron.com cc: Subject: possible RTP conference Dear Mr. Kaminski: Thank you for talking with me about a possible RTP conference. I would like to include some discussions of what has been learned in other industries. As I indicated, Frank Wolak suggested that I contact you. In discussing power markets with Frank and other colleagues at Stanford and EPRI, it seems quite evident that real-time pricing for retail customers is the ""forgotten resource"" in more efficient power markets. There seems to be a lot of confusion about what RTP means and it also seems that many researchers need to address some practical but important problems. I was asked whether a group like Stanford's EMF might explore this topic and give it the visibility that would have it considered more seriously by policymakers. Frank thought that you might be someone who could help me structure a useful approach and who might also see whether Enron could become a major sponsor. I was hoping that this issue was sufficiently important to Enron that the company might consider providing $25,000. As you may appreciate, it requires some thought and effort to make sure that the product of the conference is widely circulated among key government groups. I would be very interested in hearing from you if you can provide ideas and recommendations for people (perhaps yourself or a colleague) to participate. I would also appreciate any consideration by Enron of providing funding for this effort. Thank you, Hill Huntington - retail notes.rtf Hillard G.

In the Senate: The Senate bill 78XX is with about 90% likelihood going to be voted out of the Senate tonight---without a vote having taking place in any committee. Burton announced during one of the two ""informational"" hearings that ""this is it,"" despite the view of just about everyone who appeared before the committees the bill likely won't prevent Edison from going bankrupt. The key features of the bill are: Banks and QFs get paid in full. Edison shareholders would be responsible for debts owed to suppliers No direct access. There are conflicting reports about whether the Senate will take up the bill tomorrow de-linking the bonds from the DWR contracts and whether the Republicans will go along with it. In the Assembly: The Committee is hearing the Wright and Hertzberg bills as we speak, with Hertzberg's the likely winner. That bill now provides for Direct Access under certain conditions (the amendments describing the conditions were faxed today). We're attempting to get the ""July 12"" date changed to ""the effective date of the bill"" or later. The Assembly likely won't vote the Hertzberg bill out until tomorrow at the earliest. The Problem: The Assembly and Senate bills are diametrically opposed in the way each approaches the problem---in short, the bills are two ships passing in the night. The Democratic leaders (Governor, Hertzberg, Burton) aren't talking, and Burton hasn't expressed any interest in talking---to anybody. The likely outcome given the circumstances: Burton says he's done what he needs to do (i.e., passed out a ""fair"" bill); the Assembly and Senate can't agree; they finish the budget; time runs out; they leave Friday; and Edison's left twisting. That said, there's still a chance that the Governor could call Burton and sit down with Burton and Hertzberg and work something out by Friday, or begin talking and postpone the recess until they get it worked out. But given Burton, the chance of that happening seems very slim. In short, little has changed since yesterday. Best, Jeff

Subject:: Re: Thanks & Questions
Body:: I enjoyed talking with you the other day and am happy to answer your questions: both the Texas position and the Washington DC position report to Rick Shapiro. From a government affairs standpoint, I've divided the world between Rick's group (the Americas) and Mark Schroeder's group (Europe and Asia). Both Rick and Mark report to me. Joe Allen continues as part of the Texas legislative team, working for the head of that group (formerly Kathleen Magruder). Terry Thorn has taken a commercial position in Enron and no longer works on government affairs issues for the company (except to the extent we call on various executives to help from time-to-time). ""Untermeyer, Chase"" <Chase.Untermeyer@COMPAQ.com> on 08/31/2000 04:53:09 PM To: ""'skean@enron.com'"" <skean@enron.com> cc: Subject: Thanks & Questions STEVE: I very much appreciate your call the day before yesterday and your asking if I would like to compete to succeed Joe Hillings as head of Enron's Washington office. Although until that moment I hadn't thought of returning to Washington except to serve again in national office, I would be pleased to talk further about this opportunity with you or your recruiter. In recalling our conversation, I realize that twice you asked if I had any questions, and if I had been quick to take advantage of your offer, I would have asked how government relations are handled at Enron. To whom does Joe Hillings report: to you or to Terry Thorne? You mentioned a woman who currently has responsibility for government relations in Texas and some neighboring states but is leaving for another job at Enron; to whom does she report? Then there is Joe Allen, whom I have known since our days in the Legislature; doesn't he (also) handle Texas affairs? I am sorry I didn't ask you all this on Tuesday. Whatever the answers, it's clear that government relations are much more central to the work of Enron than at Compaq, which is why it would be a very exciting place to work. Thanks again for your call, your courtesy, and your indulgence with this tardy line of questioning. With best wishes, CHASE.

Andrew Buxton who heads the European Services Network will be here for meetings with CSI and ISACs this week and also in NYC with CSI and Japaneese counterparts. Bob told me that Vivendi is the only energy interest involved as members of Andrew's group and they have expressed no interest in liberalized energy services. This would seem to be an opportunity for the UK electricity association to advise him of their interests and possibly the drilling people. During the ISAC 13 meeting last week, USTR Peter Collins reported that the WTO Working Party Dealing With China's accession had expressed concern with the recent negotiation in which the Chineese won a series of exemptions and in the case of energy services and possibly e-commerce there are price controls. We were told that a number of law firms in Washington are opposing any USTR acceptance of this provision and Bob Vastine informed ISAC 13 members should they have a view on price controls. Trade Ministers will meet in September and are likely to ratify the China accession regardless of the WTO Working Group issues. You need to let us know if Enron should consider filing a statement regarding price controls for energy services and e-commerce services. Joe

Davis To Respond Immediately to Inquiries=20 Washington (July 11) =01) House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Bill= y=20 Tauzin (R-LA) and Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee Chairman Joe Barton= =20 (R-TX) today sent the following letter to California Governor Gray Davis:= =20 July 11, 2001 The Honorable Gray Davis=20 Governor=20 State of California=20 State Capitol=20 Sacramento, California 95814=20 Dear Governor Davis:=20 ??????????? As you know, the Energy and Commerce Committee recently=20 considered legislation containing several targeted measures to assist=20 California in resolving its energy supply crisis.? One of these measures wa= s=20 a temporary =01&safe harbor=018 provision, effective only upon the Californ= ia=20 Governor=01,s request, to protect critical extended emergency operation of= =20 powerplants from challenges under the Clean Air Act.=20 ??????????? During the course of six hearings the Subcommittee on Energy an= d=20 Air Quality held on the California electric crisis, including two hearings = on=20 draft legislation, Members of the Committee repeatedly told California=20 officials that these plants were vulnerable to legal challenge, even with= =20 written =01&agreements=018 for extended operation between state air officia= ls and=20 the powerplants.? Nevertheless, California officials testifying or providin= g=20 information on behalf of your state and your citizens claimed that such a= =20 safe harbor was not necessary.=20 ??????????? I fear events have proven that on this important matter, the=20 concerns expressed by Members of our Committee were valid and that our=20 interpretation of the legal jeopardy faced by California was accurate.? On= =20 June 19th, several community groups filed a lawsuit in federal court agains= t=20 three electric generating units in California (all located at the Potrero= =20 power plant site) alleging multiple violations of the Clean Air Act for=20 emergency extended operation.? On the same day, the City and County of San= =20 Francisco filed formal notice that it would also pursue legal action agains= t=20 the three Potrero units.? All parties involved in the litigation strongly= =20 assert that the extended operation agreement between state air officials an= d=20 the Potrero power plant does nothing to prevent them from pursuing all=20 available legal remedies under federal and state law.=20 ??????????? The legal action against the units located at the Potrero power= =20 plant claims that extended operation violates limits contained in federal a= ir=20 permits and seeks fines potentially amounting to millions of dollars.?=20 Understandably, as a result of this potentially huge fine, the operator of= =20 the Potrero power plant has filed a motion with the Federal Energy Regulato= ry=20 Commission to clarify that it will not be required to operate the three=20 generating units, even during periods of electrical emergency.? Thus, the= =20 mere filing of this lawsuit could have a near-term impact of the amount of= =20 power available in California.=20 ??????????? Perhaps even more troubling is our understanding that substanti= al=20 amounts of electric power produced by peaking plants and other facilities i= n=20 California could also be subject to similar legal action.? The California= =20 Independent System Operator lists 31 units representing 1,430 megawatts of= =20 peaking units which are subject to legal limits on their total hours of=20 operation.? In addition, several new units are being brought on-line this= =20 summer without required Clean Air Act control equipment.? According to=20 incomplete information we received from the California Air Resources Board= =20 (CARB), 37 generating units have been identified in California which may=20 exhaust allowable annual operating hours contained in their air permits pri= or=20 to this summer=01,s peak demand period.? These units may represent up to 2%= of=20 generation, approximately the critical operating reserve shortfall of a Sta= ge=20 III electric emergency.=20 ??????????? Although presented with written requests for information from t= he=20 Committee on April 2, 2001, CARB could not or would not provide the Committ= ee=20 with precise information on units that may have been off-line due to permit= =20 limits, a projection of the number of generating units that will face permi= t=20 constraints that could cause such units to be off-line, the amount of=20 generation associated with these facilities, the possible impact of these= =20 units on system reliability, and additional information related to air=20 emissions from facilities that will be operating under =01&modified=018=20 conditions.?? We believe that in the face of the pending legal action, it i= s=20 even more important that such information be accurately and objectively=20 determined.=20 ??????????? As we mentioned above, over several months in the spring and=20 early summer of this year, the Committee sought California=01,s support of = an=20 extremely narrow safe harbor provision to protect the extended operation of= =20 certain powerplants.? Regrettably, the Committee did not receive any suppor= t=20 from your administration for such changes to the law, as represented by the= =20 testimony and responses attached to this letter.? Instead, witnesses=20 representing California claimed such a legal safe harbor for emergency=20 generation was unnecessary -- even if it could only be granted during perio= ds=20 of emergency and upon your personal request to the Environmental Protection= =20 Agency (EPA).?=20 ??????????? It appears now that citizen groups in California -- as well as= =20 the City and County of San Francisco -- do not believe that the actions tak= en=20 by you, your state agencies and local air quality districts are legal.? The= =20 pending litigation challenges the very agreements which California previous= ly=20 claimed granted sufficient legal =01&flexibility=018 to keep these units ru= nning=20 during times of emergency.? It is time, then, to reconsider this issue.=20 ??????????? So that the Committee may understand the extent of this critica= l=20 situation and respond accordingly, we would ask for your consideration of t= he=20 following:=20 (1) We would urge you to reply fully to the Committee=01,s earlier requests= that=20 CARB specifically identify each generating unit and power plant that is in= =20 jeopardy of exceeding limitations contained in the Clean Air Act and thus= =20 potentially subject to the citizen suit provisions of the Act.? We should= =20 have a clear idea of the power production which is at risk.=20 (2) In view of the fact that we have moved from the world of legal theory= =20 into the world of legal fact and several California generating units are no= w=20 being sued under authorities contained in the Clean Air Act, we ask whether= =20 you will now favor creating in federal law a limited, environmentally-neutr= al=20 safe harbor for these essential units which could only be effectuated upon= =20 your request to EPA.=20 (3) Finally, we would ask that if you support such legislation, that you wo= rk=20 with our Committee so that we can truly try and resolve this issue in a=20 targeted provision which helps ensure the lights stay on in California this= =20 summer.=20 ??????????? Thank you in advance for your consideration of our requests. Sincerely, W.J.

Subject:: House Energy Committee Passes First Energy Package
Body:: Late this morning, the House Energy and Commerce Committee adoped the committee print, as amended, of an energy package that addresses conservation, clean coal, renewables, hydro, nuclear, and boutique fuels. The vote was 50 to 5 to report the bill. Other committees -- Ways and Means, Science, and Resources -- also moved their energy bills this week. Thus, the House is on track to consider a merged package before the start of the August Recess on August 3rd. As to electricity, during the several days of debate this week both Chairmen Tauzin and Barton reaffirmed their intention to next move to electricity issues. Mr. Barton's staff advised me this morning that the subcommittee he chairs will hold a hearing on Friday, July 20th on all electricity issues other than transmission. While Mr. Barton has publicly held out hope of marking up an electricity bill this month, sources on and off the committee do not see this timetable as realistic. On the Senate side, the majority staff is working on an electricity ""white paper"" that may be circulated for comment next week. Below is a recap of action on amendments of interest to Enron: 1. Last night, on a largely partisan vote (with Democrats Hall, Green and John voting with the Republicans) the Committee rejected an amendment by Rep. Jane Harman (D-CA) (that was to have been offered by Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA)) that would have retroactively amended the FERC refund date and essentially ordered refunds regardless of amounts owed to power sellers. 2. First thing this morning the Committee, again on a largely partisan basis (with Democrats Hall, Green, John and Towns), rejected a Waxman amendment to impose cost-of-service rates on all power in the West (other than generation added after 1/1/01). (Originally, Mr. Waxman was going to offer amendment to impose cost-of-service rates only on those who do not supply all available power during an emergency, but he ended up offering basically what he had pursued in subcommittee on the old ""Californa Only"" bill.) 3. The Committee adopted an amendment by Rep. Shadegg to amend the Natural Gas Act to make it clear that a natural gas ""transportation facility"" shall not be added to the National Register of Historic Places until FERC has abandoned the facility. Apparently there have been some instances of ""old"" pipelines being considered as ""historic places"" under federal law. The House Resources Committee added a similar amendment to its package yesterday. 4. By voice vote, the Committee rejected a Waxman Amendment to require the president to propose and implement a plan to bring U.S. greenhouse gases down to 1990 levels. There was strong opposition voiced by many Republicans and Democrats to this amendment. 5. By mixed vote of 24 to 29, the Committee defeated a Waxman Amendment to set cost and performance goals for renewables, including wind power, and authorize federal funds to assist with commercial project costs (up to 50 percent).

Generators deny gouging.=20 By NANCY VOGEL and JENIFER WARREN, Times Staff Writers ?????SACRAMENTO--Wholesale electricity suppliers overcharged California's= =20 utilities more than $500 million during December and January, an amount tha= t=20 the federal government should demand be refunded, according to a=20 no-holds-barred state report released Thursday. ?????The report by the California Independent System Operator, which overse= es=20 the flow of electricity in the state, said power suppliers charged $11=20 billion during those two months alone--more than they did for all of 1999. ?????Studying various market dynamics, the agency concluded that there was = a=20 ""prima facie case"" that the unnamed generators and marketers had charged $5= 62=20 million above ""just and reasonable"" prices, warranting further investigatio= n=20 and federal hearings into the appropriateness of refunds. ?????The state report is the most accusatory of a number of studies=20 undertaken to determine why wholesale electricity prices have soared in=20 California since last summer, throwing the state's biggest utilities into= =20 financial crisis and dashing hopes for lower consumer rates under=20 deregulation. ?????The study also provides new ammunition to members of California's=20 congressional delegation, who have unsuccessfully been pressing the Federal= =20 Energy Regulatory Commission to impose price ceilings on wholesale=20 electricity costs. ?????Generators defended their operating practices and rejected the=20 allegation that they had raked in unfairly large profits in December and=20 January. ?????""We have played by the rules, acted ethically and legally in all our= =20 operations,"" said Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Houston-based Reliant= =20 Energy, which owns power plants capable of supplying more than 3 million=20 homes. ""We have nothing to hide."" ?????Gary Ackerman, executive direcor of the Western Power Trading Forum,= =20 said the Cal-ISO report does not account for less tangible factors that ten= d=20 to drive up prices, such as political and financial uncertainties. ?????""Those are the things my people take into account when deciding whethe= r=20 to sell into California,"" said Ackerman. He noted that, in the second week = of=20 December, a period analyzed in the Cal-ISO report, electricity prices were= =20 higher in the Pacific Northwest than in California. ?????The report, he said, ""provides some reasonable questions which will be= =20 responded to by my members, under FERC authority."" ?????Cal-ISO officials stressed Thursday that they are not accusing any=20 seller of inflating prices but are simply asking for federal action to=20 restrain costs. ?????""We have not seen prices come down to what we feel are justifiable=20 levels,"" said Anjali Sheffrin, director of market analysis for Cal-ISO. ?????Although federal energy commission officials on Thursday refused to=20 comment on the study, many experts predicted that refunds would not be=20 forthcoming. ?????Since July, when Gov. Gray Davis first asked the federal commission to= =20 give San Diego Gas & Electric customers refunds for electricity costs that= =20 doubled and in some cases tripled, the agency has refused to order power=20 sellers to give back some of their profits to California utilities and=20 consumers. ?????The commission, charged by Congress with assuring ""just and reasonable= ""=20 wholesale electricity rates, has also resisted imposing firm price caps on= =20 California's electricity market. In November, the commission called that=20 market ""dysfunctional"" and vulnerable to manipulation by power sellers, but= =20 the agency has so far failed to document or punish specific cases of such= =20 anti-competitive behavior. ?????""The real question is what is FERC going to do with all of this?"" said= =20 Gary Stern, chief of market analysis for Southern California Edison, once o= ne=20 of the two biggest buyers of electricity in California. ""Based on past=20 history, we think they're probably going to say they don't see wrongdoing= =20 that provides a reason for refund."" ?????Determining rebates could prove a logistical nightmare for federal=20 regulators and Cal-ISO, Stern said, but the data exist to show how much it= =20 cost power plant owners to generate electricity and what price they charged= . ?????Given that Edison and PG&E have defaulted on payments of hundreds of= =20 millions to power sellers, Stern said, a rebate order wouldn't lead to=20 reimbursement for individual utility customers. Instead, it could help the= =20 utilities eliminate some of their debt to generators and marketers. ?????Edison and PG&E have been pushed nearly to bankruptcy by high wholesal= e=20 costs, which they could not pass on to their customers because of a=20 state-imposed rate freeze.=20 ?????Last week, Davis announced that Edison had agreed in principle to stat= e=20 financial help in exchange for its transmission lines. Negotiations with PG= &E=20 continue. ?????The Folsom-based Cal-ISO drew its conclusions after reviewing=20 electricity purchases made between Dec. 8, 2000, and Jan. 31, 2001. ?????To calculate the cost of producing electricity in those months, Cal-IS= O=20 analysts assumed power plant owners were buying natural gas from the spot= =20 market, where prices soared this winter, and were running old, inefficient= =20 plants. They also assumed relatively high prices for air emission credits i= n=20 Southern California and added a 10% buffer to the operating costs. ?????Cal-ISO officials then compared these costs with the prices sellers we= re=20 paid. Their report did not name the individual sellers, which range from th= e=20 province of British Columbia to the publicly owned Los Angeles Department o= f=20 Water and Power to private companies. ?????Several lawmakers praised the report as long overdue. ?????""It's about time,"" said state Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey),=20 chairwoman of the Senate Energy Committee. She said that the desire among= =20 some legislators to seize power plants and take other drastic actions stems= =20 from the sense that ""there's no one willing to enforce the provisions of th= e=20 federal power act regarding just and reasonable rates. ?????""The utilities are doing a great job looking out for their shareholder= s,=20 but who is looking out for ratepayers?"" she asked. ?????Consumer advocacy groups applauded Cal-ISO's action and said the=20 agency's evidence of overcharges underscored the need for hard price caps o= r=20 a tax on generator profits. ?????""It's certainly not news to us that the generators are charging=20 excessive wholesale prices,"" said Mindy Spatt, spokeswoman for the Utility= =20 Reform Network of San Francisco.

Subject:: RE: PG&E PX Credit Calculation -- CONFIDENTIAL ATTY CLIENT WORK
 PRODUCT
Body:: Thanks for the thoughts. I fully agree on BF costs and DWR costs. I believe that you are right on Est RT$ = CAISOM Imbalance, but I need to check. On the question of retroactive ratemaking, it is my understanding that you are correct. PG&E probably won't rebill, but will need to put in place an adjustment to the going forward PX Credit to ""collect"" the overpayment of Negative CTC. All of this means that the impact of the FERC refund is less than 100c on the $ for the Negative CTC. Jim -----Original Message----- From: Comnes, Alan Sent: Wednesday, November 14, 2001 4:35 PM To: Steffes, James D.; Dasovich, Jeff; Tribolet, Michael; Curry, Wanda; Mellencamp, Lisa; 'Jan Paul Acton (E-mail)'; Swain, Steve; Mara, Susan Cc: Alvarez, Ray Subject: RE: PG&E PX Credit Calculation -- CONFIDENTIAL ATTY CLIENT WORK PRODUCT I assume that if an hourly PX market clearing price is mitigated per a FERC order it would affect variable ""HC"" in the formula laid out in the attachment. It is not clear to me which variable represents hourly ISO imbalance energy costs, but I assume its ""Est RT$"". If I am right, that variable would be affected by the mitigated market price (MMP) for CAISO imbalance energy. My comments are: The FERC is able to only order refunds to jurisdictional entities and, given appeals, it may take years before the full extent of thre refunds are known. Therefore there will be a significant difference between the change in the mitigated market price (MMP) as declared by FERC and the PX credit. That is, a 10% reduction in the MMP should not be construed as having a 10% effect on the PX credit, assuming it can be recalculated at all. Specifically, only some of the ""HC"" or ""Est RT$"" costs can be adjusted per FERC refund orders. Also, the PX credit is a tariffed rate. I do not believe the PU code allows for retroactive adjustments to tariffed rates unless there was an explicit cost tracking account (e.g. a balancing A/C). To my knowledge, no such account exists here. Finally, I do not see a relationship between MMPs and (1) block forward costs on any date and (2) PG&E and/or DWR's procurement costs for the net short position post January 19. So, those PX credit costs should be unaffected by any FERC refund order. Alan Comnes -----Original Message----- From: Steffes, James D.

My take, after discussions with Terry, was that she was brought on to handle the environmental side of sustainable development, but that Palmisano was utilizing her for greenhouse gas related issues since not much had occurred on the other front yet. Burt Mike and I learned last week that she actually reports to Palmisano--he is the one who took her from consultant to employee status. I spoke with John on Friday and told him that I wasn't going to poach her now that I knew where she fit in the scheme of things. This actually solves a dilemma for me anyway. As you know, I need a more senior environmental person with good high level relationships with NGOs and I didn't want her to feel slighted when I found someone. Moreover, she has just advised us that she and her husband are moving to San Francisco and wants to telecommute.

EMSHWILLER Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL LOS ANGELES -- California may be struggling to keep its lights on, but one thing there is no shortage of is accusations over who is to blame for an electricity crisis that has sent power prices skyrocketing. In recent days, top California officials have stepped up their rhetoric against a handful of merchant power companies, many of them Texas-based, that supply the state with much of its juice. Gov. Gray Davis says companies such as Reliant Energy Inc., of Houston, have engaged in ""unconscionable price-gouging."" Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission and a Davis appointee, proclaims that a ""cartel"" of electricity producers has created artificial shortages. Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante is backing a bill that would make energy price-fixing a felony, and as a private citizen he is suing several major power producers in Los Angeles state court. Investigations Under Way About half a dozen investigations are being conducted by entities ranging from state legislative committees to the California attorney general's office. So far, these probes -- some of which have been under way for months -- haven't yet yielded either civil or criminal charges. While the energy suppliers are generating ""unconscionable profits,"" the question remains ""whether they are illegal profits,"" says California Attorney General Bill Lockyer, who has offered rewards of as much as hundreds of millions of dollars for information about lawbreaking in the energy business. Mr. Lockyer says he believes his office will eventually file civil charges against suppliers. He would very much like to add criminal counts. ""I would love to personally escort [Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth] Lay to an 8 x 10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says 'Hi my name is Spike, honey,' "" adds Mr. Lockyer. Houston-based Enron is a major energy-trading company. Like other such firms, Enron has denied wrongdoing in the California market. Mark Palmer, Enron's vice president for corporate communications, said Mr. Lockyer's comment about Mr. Lay "" is so counterproductive that it doesn't merit a response."" Investigators and academics say there is abundant evidence that individual firms have been exercising ""market power."" This term is used to denote efforts to influence wholesale-electricity prices, such as by withholding supplies. The California Independent System Operator, or ISO, which manages the state's electric transmission grid, estimates that by exercising market power, suppliers may have added about $6.8 billion to the cost of electricity in the state since early last year. A single firm exercising such power isn't necessarily illegal, says Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy Institute. If a company is a large supplier in the state and ""you're not exercising market power, you are not doing your job"" on behalf of shareholders, he says. Mr. Borenstein and others say that there are steps that should be taken against suppliers. They note that under federal power law, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission can order refunds for wholesale prices that are above ""just and reasonable"" levels. So far, FERC has tentatively ordered California suppliers to make tens of millions of dollars of such refunds, as part of that agency's ongoing inquiry into the California market. Critics of the suppliers and FERC say the refunds should be in the billions of dollars. The power industry, not surprisingly, says there is nothing to accusations of price manipulation or collusion. Executives point to a botched state-utility-deregulation plan that relies heavily on volatile spot-market purchases. Suppliers note that over the past decade, California didn't build enough new power plants to keep up with demand growth. The allegations of manipulation are ""a lot of sound and fury and they won't produce anything,"" says Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an industry trade group. Investigations Aplenty In the year since California's energy deregulation plan began resulting in higher prices and even blackouts, a flurry of investigations has gotten under way. Here are the main ones: Agency ????Investigation Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ????Whether generators are charging more than ""just and reasonable"" rates as demanded by the Federal Power Act; whether El Paso Corp. used its position as a major natural-gas supplier to the state to illegally drive up the price of fuel used to generate electricity. California Public Utilities Commission and the State Attorney General ????Whether generators and power traders have acted illegally through collusion or other means to artificially inflate electricity prices. PUC and California Independent System Operator ????Whether generation plants were shut down for spurious reasons in order to create supply shortages and, thus, to raise electricity prices. California Electricity Oversight Board ????Whether patterns of bidding and pricing in California's electricity auction indicate collusive or otherwise illegal behavior. Sources: state and federal agencies Power generators also point to sharp increases in some of their costs, particularly natural gas, which is a major power-plant fuel. This rise in natural-gas prices also has set off a flurry of investigations over possible manipulation. One such case, involving El Paso Corp., Houston, is the subject of probes by federal and state officials. El Paso denies any wrongdoing. While power-industry officials say they have been cooperating with the investigations, law-enforcement officials say they have hit some roadblocks. For instance, Mr. Lockyer's office has gone to San Francisco state court to enforce subpoenas against Reliant, Houston-based Dynegy Inc. and Southern Co. and Mirant Corp., both of Atlanta, after the companies resisted turning over certain business documents they deemed confidential. Investigators have zeroed in on the increased frequency with which plants are going out of service for unscheduled outages. At times, several thousand fewer megawatts of capacity are available than a year ago. A thousand megawatts can power about one million homes. 'Forced Outage' Rate Rises Generators say that this increased ""forced outage"" rate shows that tight supplies over the past year have required them to run plants, some of them more than 40 years old, for long periods without routine maintenance. This combination has produced more breakdowns. ""Plants have been running flat out,"" says Tom Williams, a spokesman for Duke Energy Co., Charlotte, N.C., which says that its California power plants produced 50% more electricity in 2000 than in 1999. At the same time, during periods of lower demand, the number of unplanned outages often seems to rise enough to keep supplies tight, says Frank Wolak, a Stanford University professor and chairman of the ISO's market surveillance committee. ""Clearly, something is going on here."" However, he and others say that it is almost impossible to tell why a particular pipe failed or whether such a failure was a legitimate reason to reduce output. Some of the most intriguing evidence to date about forced outages surfaced in a federal case. FERC officials said an investigation had raised questions about whether two major power companies had taken plants out of service in order to reap higher electricity prices. The charges against AES Corp., Arlington, Va., which owns the plants, and Williams Cos., Tulsa, Okla., which markets their output, asserted that those actions allowed the companies to reap an extra $10.8 million in revenue. In one instance, according to case filings, a Williams employee ""indicated"" to AES officials that his firm wouldn't financially penalize AES for extending an outage at one plant. This conversation, which was voluntarily divulged by Williams, could be an indication of collusion. Williams and AES settled the case without admitting any wrongdoing by paying back $8 million to the ISO and by taking certain other measures. A Williams spokeswoman says the employee who talked to AES was ""counseled not to enter into any conversations of that nature"" in the future. Another issue raised by the FERC case touched on maintenance procedures. According to the filings, AES stopped doing a certain procedure to keep its plant's cooling system from getting clogged. The clogging of the system was cited as a reason for one of the forced outages. Mark Woodruff, president of the AES unit that operates the plant in question, says the company substituted what it felt was an equally effective maintenance procedure. If someone was looking to keep supplies tight and prices high, changes in maintenance procedures would be an easy way to ensure that plants, particularly old ones, have frequent forced outages, says a senior utility-industry executive. By restricting maintenance resources, he says, an operator can simply allow a plant ""to take itself out of service."" Write to John R. Emshwiller at john.emshwiller@wsj.com Copyright 2001 Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service ???????????????????????Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service Costa Times 22, 2001, Tuesday SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS KR-ACC-NO: ?K4988 LENGTH: 803 words HEADLINE: ISO will give advanced warning of power blackouts BYLINE: By Mike Taugher and Andrew LaMar BODY: ??WALNUT CREEK, Calif. _ The East has its hurricane watches and hurricane warnings. Now California has power watches and power warnings to guide residents through days of summer blackouts. ??Beginning next week, forecasters who look at variables like electricity loads and transmission constraints instead of wind speeds and barometric pressure will lay the odds of blackouts being imposed the next day. If those odds appear to be 50-50 or greater, they will issue a power warning. ??In addition, the California Independent System Operator will issue 30-minute advisories to warn state residents that blackouts are probably imminent. ??The new warnings are in response to complaints that blackouts have taken people by surprise. ??""What we're hearing from the public is they wanted a little more heads-up when it comes to blackouts,"" said ISO spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle. ??Meanwhile, Gov. Gray Davis was in Chicago Monday to hear firsthand from city officials about how an advance notification program can work. State lawmakers are exploring ways to provide Californians with greater notice of potential blackouts, including scheduling them in advance. ??In Chicago, where aging lines and structural limitations have produced a string of power outages over the past two summers, residents often receive 30 minutes warning a blackout is coming, and grid operators work with city agencies and police to ensure criminals don't take advantage of the opportunity. ??California's new warning system has considerable limits. ??The ISO, after all, does not determine where blackouts occur. They simply tell the three utilities in the system _ Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric _ when to shut off power and how much to turn off. ??It is up to the utilities to determine where the blackouts occur. ??PG&E's website posts which of 14 outage blocks is next to be hit, so anyone who knows their block number could use information from PG&E and the ISO websites to prepare for a blackout. ??PG&E spokesman John Nelson said the Northern California utility can make tens of thousands of phone calls to businesses and customers who need power for life-support systems and other medical necessities ""in a very short period of time."" ??""We think that anything that increases the amount of time that we're given by the ISO . . . is a good thing,"" Nelson said, adding that at the beginning of this year the utility was assuming that it would get about 30 minutes notice before blackouts were ordered. ??In another development on Monday, state Controller Kathleen Connell issued another warning about the financial toll California's energy crisis is taking on the state treasury. Connell said the state could run out of cash by Sept. 1 if $ 13.4 billion in revenue bonds aren't sold. ??The state plans to sell the bonds in late August to cover the cost of buying electricity needed by financially troubled Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison to serve their customers. ??Even if the bonds go through without a hitch, Connell said the state will have to seek more bonds or borrow between $3 billion and $5 billion beginning February 2002 to continue buying power. She said electricity purchases are costing the state more than the governor anticipated and far less has been bought through long-term contracts than Davis planned. ??But the governor's top energy aides challenged Connell's analysis and said they believe long-term contracts now being put in place combined with conservation efforts will bring spending down. Joe Fichera, a Davis financial adviser, said the state spent $1.8 billion to buy power in April, only 1.4 percent higher than the $1.78 billion estimated. ??""I think reasonable people can differ in terms of the projections,"" Fichera said.

Included in its April sales were $126 million worth of electricity that the company bought from companies unwilling to sell to California but which Mirant purchased and then sold to California at a 12 percent markup, according to figures released by the company. ??""If the intent was to somehow attack Mirant for its role in the California market in April, then I'd have to say that the state has apparently decided to bite a helping hand,"" said Randy Harrison, CEO of Mirant's western U.S. operations. ??KRT CALIFORNIA is a premium service of Knight Ridder/Tribune ??(c) 2001, Contra Costa Times (Walnut Creek, Calif.). ??Visit the Contra Costa Times on the Web at http://www.cctimes.com/ JOURNAL-CODE: CC LOAD-DATE: May 22, 2001 of 85 DOCUMENTS 2001 Copley News Service News Service 22, 2001, Tuesday SECTION: State and regional LENGTH: 1066 words HEADLINE: State sends $533.2 million to company, part of April bill BYLINE: Ed Mendel DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??One of the biggest single checks ever issued by the state of California, $533.2 million, went to an Atlanta-based firm Friday for power purchased for California utility customers during a single month, April. ??Mirant, formerly Southern Energy, says more than half of the power came from three plants in the San Francisco Bay Area that it purchased from Pacific Gas and Electric for $801 million under a failed deregulation plan. ??State Treasurer Kathleen Connell, who displayed a blown-up copy of the check at a news conference yesterday, said she thinks the state has failed to obtain enough cheap long-term power contracts and will have to borrow more than the $13.4 billion planned. ??Connell, an elected official who issues state checks, said the power bills she had paid by last Thursday, totaling $5.1 billion, provide no basis for assuming that the price of electricity ''is dropping and that it will continue to drop through the summer.'' ??But a consultant for Gov. Gray Davis said the state, which has more long-term contracts than Connell has seen, is on track to control power costs with the aid of conservation and that it plans to meet its goals without additional borrowing. ??''I think the public should have confidence that this is not a rosy scenario,'' said Joseph Fichera of Saber Partners, a Davis consultant. ''It's the expected scenario.'' ??The state plans to issue a bond of up to $13.4 billion in late August that will repay the general-fund taxpayer money used for power purchases, about $7 billion so far. The bond will be paid off over 15 years by utility customers. ??Davis has declined to reveal details of state spending for power, arguing that the information would be used by power suppliers to submit higher bids. A group of newspapers and Republican legislators have filed lawsuits to force disclosure. ??Connell said she has received 25 contracts from 17 power suppliers. She declined to release details of the contracts, saying they are complicated and have varying prices. ??Connell said the check for $533,181,235 issued to Mirant Friday is one of the largest she has written since taking office in 1995. ??''This purchase was made entirely at spot-market prices,'' Connell said, ''even though the Department of Water Resources (the state agency that purchases power) has an executed long-term contract with this company.'' ??Mirant said in a statement that, at the request of the state, its marketing arm gave the state a ''helping hand'' by buying power from suppliers not willing to sell to the state and then reselling the power to the state. ??''We've done the state a tremendous service in purchasing power on its behalf,'' said Randy Harrison, Mirant's Western chief executive officer, ''and it's wrong for the transactions to be misinterpreted and skewed in a negative light.'' ??Mirant said its subsidiaries generated 1.377 million megawatt-hours in April, while its marketing arm purchased enough additional electricity to boost the total sold to the state during the month to 2.077 million megawatt-hours. ??The firm said the power was sold for an average of $256.87 per megawatt-hour. That's below the $346 average that the state expects to pay on the expensive spot market during the second quarter of this year, from April through June. ??But it's well above the average price of $69 per megawatt-hour said to have been obtained in the first round of long-term contracts negotiated by the state. ??Mirant purchased three power plants from PG&E capable of producing 3,000 megawatts during a controversial part of deregulation. The state Public Utilities Commission ordered utilities to sell off at least half of their fossil-fuel power plants without requiring the purchasers to provide low-cost power to California. ??The utilities sold nearly two dozen major power plants capable of producing more than 20,000 megawatts. The largest group of plants, 4,700 megawatts, went to AES Corp. of Virginia. Three Texas firms purchased plants producing 7,000 megawatts. ??The power supply situation in California remained sound enough yesterday to ward off blackouts, although temperatures are on the rise throughout the state. More heat means more air conditioning, and a greater strain on the system. ??But starting next month, the state's electricity grid managers plan to provide businesses and consumers with better forecasts of potential rolling blackouts. ??The California Independent System Operator will post on its Web site ''power warnings'' when there is at least a 50 percent chance that rolling blackouts might be required during the next 24 hours. The ISO will issue a ''power watch'' when less-critical shortages are anticipated in advance of high demand days. ??The agency also plans to give a 30-minute warning before it orders utilities to cut power to customers, posting information about probable interruptions on its Web site. Its Web site address is www.caiso.com. ??''There have been a number of requests from businesses and consumers alike that would like more advance notice and to be able to plan better. That's what we are trying to do,'' ISO spokeswoman Lorie O'Donley said. ??O'Donley said many details about how notifications will occur still have to be worked out, including whether e-mails or pagers might be used. ??In other developments in the electricity crisis: ???About 1.5 million compact fluorescent light bulbs will be distributed to 375,000 households as part of the ''Power Walk'' program that began during the weekend. Members of the California Conservation Corps are going door-to-door in parts of some cities to distribute the bulbs as part of a $20 million conservation program. ???Republican legislative leaders sent Davis a letter criticizing the governor for using taxpayer funds to hire two aides to former Vice President Al Gore as communication consultants for $30,000 a month. The Republicans said Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane operate ''a partisan, cut-throat political communications firm.'' ???The state auditor general said in a report on energy deregulation that the state is not meeting some of its goals for conservation and for building new power plants. The auditor also said the PUC does not have a process for quickly approving new transmission lines. The state has been importing about 20 percent of its power.

Rose DATELINE: SAN DIEGO BODY: ??San Dieg Gas and Electric's commercial customers are attacking the prospect of paying an average of 29 percent more to cover the state's soaring cost of buying electricity. ??At a California Public Utilities Commission hearing in San Diego yesterday, some business customers also noted the irony that only in February did they win the same rate freeze as residential customers. ??''We need rates we can depend on,'' said John Roberts, who owns an irrigation products business in San Marcos. ??SDG&E customers were the first to bear the brunt of deregulation, and the utility's residential ratepayers were the first to win a reprieve when the state passed a 6.5-cent per kilowatt hour cap. ??The SDG&E cap is expected to end for all customers in the coming weeks as the commission moves to increase SDG&E's rates to levels now paid by customers of PG&E and Edison, which are about 3 cents per kilowatt hour higher. ??Yesterday's hearing, however, was for commercial rates. ??Roberts said his San Marcos-based irrigation products company has withstood a tripling of power costs over the past year, while having to cut the cost of its products because of competition, he said. ??Roberts added that socking businesses with high costs in order to spare residential electricity customers from expected rate hikes could be counterproductive. ??''If businesses leave the state, they'll be without jobs, and a $30 savings on their power bills won't mean much,'' Roberts said. ??The hearing at the County Administration Building was attended by about 30 people. An additional hearing is scheduled at 7 p.m. today in the Community Rooms at the Oceanside Civic Center, 330 N. Coast Highway. ??Larger crowds are expected for hearings on residential rate increases.

Gray Davis' decision to spend $30,000 a month in taxpayer money to retain communications consultants known for their highly partisan work. ??Labeling consultants Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane as ""cut-throat,"" Senate GOP leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga and Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks said in a letter to Davis that the hiring ""undermines the assertions you have made both publicly and privately throughout this crisis."" ??Davis announced Friday that he retained the duo and that the state will pay them a combined $30,000 a month for at least the next six months. ??""We're not going to support the hiring of political hacks on government payroll,"" Brulte said in an interview. ""Lehane and Fabiani are very talented. The issue is which payroll is appropriate. . . . These are political opposition research attack dogs. If the governor wants them, he ought to pay for them with his $30-million political war chest."" ??Some consumer advocates also criticized the move, citing the consultants' work on behalf of Southern California Edison. In their private consulting business, Fabiani and Lehane are working to win over public and political support for Davis' $3.5-billion plan to rescue Edison from its financial difficulties. Legislation embodying aspects of the deal is pending in Sacramento. ??On Monday, Brulte and Cox also complained about the consultants' dual role. ??""California taxpayers should not be asked to finance political consultants or individuals who have a vested business interest with the state,"" the letter said. ??Fabiani and Lehane had worked in the Clinton administration, and in Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign, where they gained a reputation as attack-oriented operatives. Lehane on Monday defended the governor's decision to use tax money to pay their fees, saying government often hires outside experts and that he and Fabiani will ""serve as communications advisors to help the governor fight against these generators."" ??""The Republicans,"" Lehane added, ""ought to be spending time writing letters to George W. Bush to get him to stop the Texas generators from gouging California. . . . That is the real issue here."" ??Davis, meanwhile, returned to California on Monday after a weekend of fund-raisers. He was in Texas on Saturday for a Dallas event that had been scheduled for April 11. It was postponed when Pacific Gas & Electric filed for bankruptcy protection. ??""There is a very large fund-raising base for Democrats in Texas,"" Davis' campaign strategist, Garry South, said of the state that is home to some of the generators that Davis has criticized. ??Davis traveled to Chicago for another fund-raiser Sunday, then met Monday with city officials to discuss how Chicago deals with electrical blackouts. ??After blackouts crippled downtown Chicago in the summer of 1999, Mayor Richard M. Daley demanded that the city's electricity provider, Commonwealth Edison, give advance notice of power cuts. Customers now sometimes receive warnings two or three days in advance. ??Davis emerged from the meeting saying ""the utilities have got to tell us in advance when they're going to have a planned blackout."" ??It was not, however, readily apparent how Chicago's solutions would translate to California, because its electrical problems are vastly different. Rather than suffering a shortage of electricity throughout the grid like California, Chicago has the more microcosmic ills of an aging system--an obsolete transformer going down, for example, leaving several city blocks in the dark until workers can fix it. ??* ??Times staff writer Eric Slater contributed to this story.

BYLINE: DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Legislative Democrats today will sue federal energy regulators, charging that their inaction threatens elderly people in nursing homes, children in day care centers, law enforcement and its ability to fight crime, and the state's drinking water supplies. ??Rather than focus on record wholesale energy costs, the lawsuit takes a new tack, homing in on the threat to health and safety posed by California's energy crisis and the blackouts likely this summer. ??A draft of the suit seeks to force the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to set ""just and reasonable"" wholesale power rates as a way of ending the crisis before blackouts occur. The action is being filed by veteran trial attorney Joe Cotchett on behalf of Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco), Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks), and the city of Oakland. ??""A crisis of unprecedented dimensions is already taking shape in California,"" the draft says. ""The public health, safety and welfare of the state's 34 million residents is in jeopardy due to the tragic consequences of rolling blackouts and punitive prices."" ??Suit Says Blackouts Pose Threats ??Until now, most California officials, including Gov. Gray Davis, have been urging that the regulatory commission cap wholesale power prices as a way of limiting costs to the state, which has spent more than $6 billion buying electricity since January. ??In the lawsuit, Cotchett will be arguing that while higher bills will stretch the budgets of people on fixed incomes, frail elderly people ""are left to wonder if their oxygen tanks, drip IVs, dialysis machines and electricity-powered therapeutic beds will respond when they are needed."" ??""Rolling blackouts represent more than just an annoyance for the men, women and children with disabilities,"" the suit says. ""They represent an imminent threat to life, health and independence."" ??Cotchett said the suit will be filed in the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, bypassing the federal trial court. Cotchett said the circuit court has direct jurisdiction over FERC. ??Joining Cotchett will be Clark Kelso, a professor at McGeorge Law School in Sacramento who briefly was insurance commissioner last year after Chuck Quackenbush resigned. Kelso said he initially was skeptical that lawmakers had legal standing to sue. But after Cotchett spoke with him, Kelso said he became convinced the suit had merit. ??""Let's face it,"" said Kelso, a Republican, ""this is the single most important issue that the state faces for the next six months."" ??Watching the Water Supply ??The suit cites warnings from governmental agencies about the implications of blackouts, including one the state Department of Health Services issued earlier this month to public water agencies statewide. The warning contains a sample notice that local water authorities should give to consumers. ??""If the water looks cloudy or dirty,"" the warning says, ""you should not drink it."" The warning suggests that if people are concerned about water quality, they can boil it or add ""eight drops of household bleach to one gallon of water, and let it sit for 30 minutes."" ??Most water agencies have back-up generators. But the suit says that ""if an agency's water treatment facilities are hit by a power outage, a two-hour blackout can result in two-day interruptions in providing safe drinking water because of time needed to bring equipment back online and flush potentially contaminated water from the system.""

BYLINE: MIGUEL BUSTILLO, NANCY VOGEL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Californians will hear an expanded forecast on their morning commutes this summer, courtesy of the energy crisis: ""The 405 Freeway is jammed, there's a slim chance of showers, and oh, by the way, there's a 50% likelihood of blackouts."" ??By the end of this month, the California Independent System Operator, the agency that manages the state's power grid, expects to issue 24-hour forecasts generally detailing when and where blackouts can be expected. ??It is also piecing together a high-tech system to give businesses, government officials and the public at least a half-hour notice of a probable blackout in their area. ??Just how those notices will be issued remains somewhat up in the air, but Cal-ISO is talking with private companies capable of notifying more than 10,000 customers a minute via fax and phone, and millions a minute via wireless communications such as pagers. ??Cal-ISO assembled the plan after complaints from businesses, particularly those in the Silicon Valley, that last-minute blackouts were costing California millions. The plan also responds to growing political pressure for the public to be kept informed of the barrage of outages that is expected to darken the state this summer because of insufficient supplies of electricity. ??If Californians' electricity use pattern is similar to last year's, Cal-ISO has projected, the state could suffer 34 days of blackouts, making increased notification crucial. ??With a shortage of hydroelectric power imports from the drought-stricken Pacific Northwest, and no new power plants coming online until July, the agency calculates that there will be a supply-demand gap in June of 3,700 megawatts--enough power to supply 2.8 million homes. A national utility industry group painted a more dire scenario last week when it predicted that California will experience up to 260 hours of blackouts this summer. ??""The weather report and traffic report are good analogies; people know they are not 100% accurate, but if [a blackout] really means a lot to them, they will check in,"" said Mike Florio of the Utility Reform Network, who serves on the Cal-ISO board. ??Details remain sketchy, and the programs may be altered when the board meets Thursday. But a Web page called ""Today's Outlook"" on the agency's Internet site, http://www.caiso.com, will be created to illustrate, hour by hour, how much electricity is available during a 24-hour period and whether there is a predicted surplus or shortfall. ??Media outreach will be expanded to provide news bulletins on electricity conditions a day in advance. They will not only include demand projections and the effects of weather, but they also will define the level of emergency that is expected. ??A ""power watch"" will be sounded during stage 1 and stage 2 shortages, and a more serious ""power warning"" if there is a 50-50 chance of a stage 3, which often results in blackouts. (Stage 1 emergencies occur when power reserves drop below 7%, stage 2 5% and stage 3 1.5%.) ??Most important, Cal-ISO is pledging to provide 30-minute notice of probable blackouts to people in the areas served by Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric, among others. In addition to giving the warnings on the Internet and through the mass media, Cal-ISO will sound alarms to select e-mail addresses and pager numbers on ""blast lists,"" or massive computer databases that it will assemble. ??""The technology is there. This is a war California is in, and we should be deploying high-tech solutions,"" said Carl Guardino of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group, the Cal-ISO board member who had been pushing hardest for better notification. ""Every time California goes black, the economy sees red."" ??Guardino said that businesses and public agencies are now receiving just two- to six-minute warnings before blackouts, not nearly enough to react. ??""A two-minute warning may be sufficient in a football game, but it is insufficient to protect California businesses and the public,"" he said. ??Though businesses and government agencies are expected to make the most of the warnings, Florio said residents also will benefit. ??""It will be more of a challenge to get the information to individual homeowners, but if someone works at home, and sets it up to get an e-mail notice, they can take advantage,"" he said. ??In other energy news Monday, the woman in charge of paying California's power bills warned that a $13.4-billion bond issue to cover electricity purchases will be insufficient and that the state will have to borrow $4 billion more before it runs out of cash in February. ??Calling a news conference in the capital, state Controller Kathleen Connell questioned the key assumptions underpinning Gov. Gray Davis' financial plan for overcoming the energy crisis. The plan assumes the $13.4 billion in bond sales will repay state coffers for electricity purchases and cover future power buys for the next two years. ??Connell's opinion is notable because, as the state's chief check writer, the independently elected Democrat is privy to information about the prices the state is paying for electricity bought on the spot market and through long-term contracts--data that Davis has largely kept secret. ??Davis' advisors and Department of Finance officials dispute Connell's warnings.

Long commutes. Mediocre schools. Housing costs. At the Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area, the Valley's answer to Central Park, such ordinary concerns about money, time and resources stretched too thin for comfort tumbled out again and again during interviews with some two dozen people visiting this green oasis. ??Sprawling northwest from the tangled junction of the San Diego and Ventura freeways, the recreation area is a pastoral patchwork of three golf courses bracketed by Woodley Avenue Park to the east and Lake Balboa to the west. It hardly looks like a battleground, but the 2,000-acre park straddles something of a political fault line in the mayoral contest. ??Both candidates in the June 5 runoff, former state legislator Antonio Villaraigosa and City Atty. James K. Hahn, have staked out the Valley as prime campaign turf, packed with thousands of up-for-grabs voters whose affections might well tip the race. ??And the Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area is wedged between an electoral no man's land--a southern ribbon of the Valley where about 60% of voters shunned both men in the election's first round--and a central Valley region where Villaraigosa took first place in April, beating Hahn by roughly a 2-to-1 margin. ??Between them, the candidates are expected to spend more than $10 million by election day to get their messages out. But it's not clear whether these impassioned appeals are reaching their intended targets. ??Less than a month before the election, many people here are preoccupied with concerns that have little to do with City Hall. And when they do voice interest in local matters, some seem unable to connect these issues to a candidate. ??For instance, several Valley voters interviewed in the park in early May said that knotted traffic on the San Diego Freeway was a major problem. But no one mentioned a plan Villaraigosa unveiled in March to buy hundreds of new buses and slash fares in a sweeping bid to cut vehicle traffic, or a proposal from Hahn to add more carpool lanes on freeways. ??Which raises a fundamental challenge for would-be mayors: Sometimes, there's just too much going on in everyday life to tune in to city politics. ""I know I ought to,"" many people confess sheepishly, ""but I just haven't gotten around to it yet."" ??Take Randye Sandel, 58, a blond and bespectacled oil painter from Valley Village. Sandel said she plans to vote for Hahn, ""a known quantity"" in City Hall, but a moment later admits that she might change her mind. The thing is, Sandel adds, she's been really busy setting up an art exhibition at a Santa Monica gallery and has yet to research her mayoral options. ""I've been totally immersed in my own life,"" she said. ??Same goes for Harold Seay, a muscular golfer heading back to his car after playing 18 holes. The 44-year-old music teacher from Encino said he's had his hands full for weeks rehearsing graduation recitals for a Brentwood private school. ""The news is the last thing I'm paying attention to,"" he said. ??But both voters can easily rattle off their most pressing concerns. Sandel, who used to teach art at Valley College, said she is particularly worried about education. ??""The last few semesters I taught, I was horrified by the academic preparedness of the students. They were practically illiterate,"" she said. ""They couldn't take notes from my lecture because they didn't understand the vocabulary. That bothers me a lot. Who's going to inherit this country?"" ??Seay, who recently moved to Los Angeles from Miami, said he is troubled by the air pollution and racial tension he has encountered here. Seay is African American and his wife is Italian, he said, and their 9-year-old daughter is ""stuck half-and-half,"" caught in what Seay regards as a troubling black-white divide. ""That black-white thing really turns me off,"" he said. ""I care about people getting along."" ??As the mayoral race hurtles into its final weeks, some of Hahn and Villaraigosa's most spirited skirmishes have erupted over crime and law enforcement issues. Each man is trying to burnish his own crime-fighting credentials while accusing his rival of neglecting public safety. ??The candidates have squabbled especially fiercely over compressed work schedules for police officers--the notion of squashing the police workweek into three 12-hour days, or possibly four 10-hour days. The Police Protective League endorsed Hahn, who supports the so-called 3-12 schedule favored by the union. Villaraigosa, whom Hahn has often characterized as soft on crime, seized upon the scheduling issue to retaliate, arguing that the three-day week would jeopardize public safety. ??But interviews with people visiting the Valley's biggest park revealed that crime--which has declined significantly since Mayor Richard Riordan took office eight years ago--was not the main issue weighing on these voters' minds. That distinction belongs to something that has walloped wallets far and wide across this car-addled city: the soaring price of gasoline. ??As he cooled down after a six-mile run near Balboa Lake, Ray Verdugo summed up the problem facing many gas-guzzlers as prices approached $2 a gallon: ""I made a big mistake and bought a big SUV,"" lamented the retired Rocketdyne engineer from Winnetka. ""I'm on a fixed income, and [gasoline prices] keep going up all the time."" ??Big-city mayors, to be sure, wield minimal influence over gasoline pumps. Gas prices are swayed by market forces, including the international cost of crude oil, rising demand and limited refinery capacity. Nonetheless, about a third of voters interviewed as they ambled around the Sepulveda Basin named gas prices as a top concern. Half as many said they were worried about crime. ??Some voters said they were troubled by California's electricity woes, although Los Angeles residents have been spared shortages and blackouts because the city's municipal utility avoided deregulation. ??""I think building more power plants would help,"" said Julie Erickson, 27, a figure-skating instructor from Reseda. ??And then there are the things that people aren't talking about. Nobody (at least nobody in an admittedly unscientific sample of voters culled over two days in the Sepulveda Basin) mentioned the Rampart police scandal or the recruiting problems crippling the Los Angeles Police Department. ??No one uttered so much as a peep about neighborhood councils, that much-ballyhooed innovation of the new city charter. Even the Valley secession movement--which Villaraigosa has pointed to as ""the biggest challenge facing Los Angeles""--hardly earned an honorable mention from this cross-section of Valleyites. Only one voter referred to secession at all, saying that she favored it. ??Instead, many people voiced personal gripes, the kind of woes unlikely to vault to the center of the mayoral radar screen--but issues that nonetheless embody the high quality of life both candidates envision for Los Angeles. ??One man, a sunburned golfer who lives in Van Nuys, said he's dismayed that the city hasn't finished building a new golf clubhouse and restaurant at the Woodley Lakes Golf Course. Another frequent park visitor, a retired housekeeper from Sherman Oaks, complained about the windblown litter she sees as she walks her dog around Balboa Lake. ??But some problems vexing these voters seem frankly beyond the grasp of even the most poll-tested candidate. ??Sandel, the oil painter, got downright metaphysical after a good 15 minutes spent mulling the troubles facing Los Angeles, and indeed the world. Technology, she concluded, was advancing so rapidly that it was crowding out humanity's intuitive, spiritual side. ??""I think there's an extraordinary sense of collective despair and psychological uncertainty smoldering just below the surface,"" she said.

Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana (Orange County), who heads a special committee reviewing energy prices, called the ""ramping"" allegations, first disclosed in The Chronicle on Sunday, ""outrageous acts of manipulation."" ???Dunn said that even if the practices did not violate current law, legislation could be drafted to make such acts illegal in the future. ???""We're looking at it, yes, from the point of view of civil or criminal statutes that may exist but also whether legislation should be introduced to render it a violation for future such acts."" ???Dunn's committee already has been investigating charges that power generators ""gamed"" the wholesale energy market to boost their profits. ???The Chronicle reported Sunday that power companies used a complex tactic to alter the output of their plants, sometimes several times within an hour. ???Sources who work in the plants said the ploy enabled the companies to drive up the prices they receive for electricity. The firms avoided detection by still meeting the terms of their contracts, which required them to supply a certain amount of power each hour. The sources said the tactic greatly contributed to deteriorating physical conditions at the plants, leading to the record level of outages now plaguing California plants. ???The senate committee, which convened in March after The Chronicle reported that power companies had overstated the growth in demand for electricity in California, has obtained confidential bidding and generation data for power-generating companies. Dunn said the data will be analyzed to determine which plants employed the ramping tactic. He added that the issue would be examined in a public hearing in the coming weeks. ???Meanwhile, pressure continued to mount on generating companies that drove electricity supplies through the roof during the past year. ???Sources said the California Public Utilities Commission, which is investigating allegedly unnecessary plant shutdowns, has narrowed its focus. It is targeting several plants that had no apparent defects yet went offline during periods when prices were rising because of limited electricity supplies. ???Commissioner Jeff Brown said the names of these plants are under court seal. However, Dow Jones reported yesterday that one of them was a San Diego-area plant co-owned by Dynegy Inc. of Houston and NRG Inc. of Minneapolis. Another was a Pittsburg plant owned by Mirant Corp. of Atlanta. The companies denied the allegations. ???On another front, Sen. John Burton, D-San Francisco, and Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks (Los Angeles County), were expected to file a lawsuit this morning against the Federal Energy Regulatory Committee for failing to carry out its stated duty of ensuring ""just and reasonable"" electricity rates. ???""Their central failing is that they don't follow the law,"" Burton said in an interview.

A1 LENGTH: 1527 words HEADLINE: Half-hour notice of blackouts planned; FAST ALERTS: Power grid operator may send voice, e-mail messages SOURCE: Chronicle Sacramento Bureau BYLINE: Lynda Gledhill DATELINE: Sacramento BODY: Californians will receive 30 minutes' warning that blackouts may be imposed -- enough time, it is hoped, to get out of the elevator or through a dangerous intersection, the state's power grid managers said yesterday. ???The California Independent System Operator also will provide a daily power forecast 24 hours in advance so residents and businesses can plan for blackouts the same way people prepare for severe storms. ???""We want a system that is proactive,"" said Carl Guardino, an ISO board member and president of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group. ""When the last few rolling blackouts hit there was as little as two minutes' warning. Two minutes may be fine in a football game, but it's not fine for California's economy or safety."" ???ISO officials also said they are examining high-tech ways of quickly spreading the word about impending blackouts to homeowners and businesses through mass e-mails, faxes, automated phone calls and pager messages. ???The plan, detailed in a report issued yesterday, still falls far short of other proposals being pushed in the Legislature. Lawmakers have suggested scheduling blackout days months in advance and having California join with other Western states to form a ""buyer's cartel"" that would refuse to pay for power when prices become too high. ???""It's not the report I was expecting, but 30 minutes of notice is certainly better than two,"" said Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Ray. ""No matter how you slice it, this summer is going to be miserable. The question is whether we want to have planned misery or unplanned misery."" ???A spokesman for the California Manufacturers and Technology Association, which commissioned a recent report that found unplanned blackouts could cost the state economy $21.8 billion, said the ISO policy changes will be a tremendous help to many businesses. ???""In this electrically unreliable world, any notification manufacturers can get is good,"" said Gino DeCaro, a spokesman for the association. ""While 30 minutes won't be enough for some, for most manufacturers it will be sufficient."" The ISO will wait for guidance from the governor and lawmakers regarding more complicated issues such as the creation of scheduled blackouts, said Michael Florio, an ISO board member and official at The Utility Reform Network. ???""There are bigger public policy ramifications,"" Florio said. ???The ideas will be discussed in greater detail at an ISO board meeting Thursday. Stephanie McCorkle, an ISO spokeswoman, said the changes are just updates of policies already in place. ???WARNING OF 'PROBABLE' BLACKOUTS ???The 30-minute advance-notification system, scheduled to go into effect early next month, would warn of ""probable"" blackouts, including the amount of load that will have to be curtailed in each service area. ???Until now, the agency has refused to give more than a few minutes' warning, saying it did not want to alarm people when there was still a chance that a last-minute purchase of power could stave off blackouts. The utilities also have resisted giving warnings, saying they did not want to tip off burglars and other criminals. ???The ISO also has been working to upgrade its Web site to provide the most current information about how much electricity is being used and how much is available. It will also establish a system this summer through which that information can be sent in an hourly e-mail. ???This information may make it easier for larger users of electricity to plan their operations, said ISO spokeswoman Lorie O'Donley. ???Also planned by the ISO is a ""Power Watch/Power Warning"" system that would provide a 24-hour notice of high-demand days. ???Under the two-tiered system, a ""Power Watch"" would be declared whenever a Stage One or Stage Two alert is likely, while a ""Power Warning"" would be issued whenever there is at least a 50 percent chance of a Stage Three alert. ???With one report suggesting California may see as many as 700 hours of rolling blackouts this summer, lawmakers are hard at work trying to find ways to make the outages easier for power customers to cope with. ???The idea of a buyer's cartel, the subject of a Capitol hearing today, would have California -- in partnership with other states -- set a firm ceiling on what it will pay power producers for electricity this summer -- and not one dime more. ???The idea, which has attracted the support of some key lawmakers and the cautious interest of Gov. Gray Davis, could potentially curtail the exorbitantly high prices the state has been paying for electricity. ???The trade-off would be the likelihood of more frequent blackouts than if the state continues to pay any price electricity sellers demand. ???The maximum the state would pay would be set by a formula, based on such things as the cost of natural gas. A reasonable profit for power producers would be built in, supporters said. ???DESIGNATING BLACKOUT DAYS ???Meanwhile, Assemblyman Mike Briggs, R-Fresno, will introduce a bill today that would require the state's utilities and Public Utilities Commission to designate days for potential blackouts to each block. ???For example, a customer located in Block 3 of Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s service area could be told in advance that power will be turned off June 5 if blackouts are needed that day. ???""Right now, every day is a potential blackout day,"" Briggs said. ""This way people would know when their potential days are."" ??On alert ???-- When demand is high, the ISO will forecast peak demand, power supply and weather 24 hours in advance. ???-- A ""power watch"" will be issued when it is likely the grid will reach Stage 1 (system is within 7% of running out of power) or Stage 2 (system is within 5% of running out of power). ???-- A ""power warning"" will be issued when there is at least a 50% chance of a Stage 3 alert (demand is within 1.5% of supply). ???Who calls a blackout? ???Engineers in Folsom at the Independent System Operator keep watch on the state's power consumption. When they determine that energy reserves have dipped below 1.5 percent of available capacity, the ISO can order utilities to start cutting juice. Officials said this week they would give 30 minutes' notice before blackouts begin. The ISO tells the utilities exactly how much power to cut. ???Q: Who decides who gets blacked out and for how long? ???A: That's up to the utilities. PG&E has divided its 4.5 million customers into 14 blocks; each block is darkened for one to two hours at a time. The blocks are defined by PG&E's network of circuits rather than by geography. Thus, neighborhoods in San Francisco, Oakland and Pleasant Hill can be blacked out simultaneously. ???Q: How many users are blacked out at once? ???A: Each of PG&E's 14 ???blocks represents about 550 megawatts of electricity. (A megawatt is enough electricity to power 1,000 homes.) If PG&E is told to cut more than 550 megawatts, it can shut down two or more blocks at a time. PG&E also can black out smaller portions within each block if the ISO's requirements are for less than 550 megawatts. ???Q: How is power shut off? ???A: This is a straightforward matter of shutting off circuits in a power substation by computer or sending a crew to flip the switches by hand. ???Q: How many days of blackouts have we had this year and how many customers have been affected? ???A: A total of 3,035,000 customers have been blacked out in the six days of rolling blackouts since Jan. 1, 2001. ???Q: Which block of customers will be blacked out next? ???A: Some or all customers in Block 1. ???Q: How do I know what block I'm in? ???A: Look for the words ""Rotating Outage Block"" followed by a number on your bill. If it says Block 50, you share an electrical circuit with a hospital, police station or other ""essential service"" that is normally exempt from service cuts. ???Q: What should I do when the lights go out? ???A: Power experts advise: ???-- Turn off all lights and appliances to prevent damage-causing power surges when service is restored. Leave one light on to indicate when the electricity is back. ???-- Use caution when driving because traffic signals may be out. Treat all intersections as a four-way stop. ???-- To protect food, open refrigerator and freezer doors only when absolutely necessary. ???-- Keep a flashlight and radio with fresh batteries available. If you light candles, observe the usual safety precautions. ???-- If the lights go out, check with neighbors to determine if only your home is affected. It may be a downed power line or some other problem, in which case you should alert PG&E or your city electrical bureau. ???-- When the power returns, turn on one appliance at a time to prevent power surges. ???-- Don't plug a generator into the wall; when the lights return, it can send a high-voltage current through the system that can electrocute power workers. ???-- Tell children who are home alone to remain calm, to turn off the TV and computers, and not to use candles. ???Sources: PG&E, Chronicle staff ???Chronicle Graphic ??E-mail Lynda Gledhill at lgledhill@sfchronicle.com.

""And he's got to stop looking so cozy with business."" ??The president's proposal emphasizes stepped-up production and modest conservation measures. It received mixed reviews from an anxious public that appears to want quick relief but sees the plan only helping after several years. ??Although Bush says his program will allow Americans to retain the lifestyle they are accustomed to, only 30% of those surveyed said they believe it. Two of three said major lifestyle changes will be necessary to solve the nation's energy woes. ??Nearly half said the Bush plan would not do enough to conserve energy, and 43% said the plan would do too little to increase production. ??Americans also were split over the Bush proposal to increase the number of nuclear power plants to generate electricity: 49% for and 46% against. ??The tepid response to the Bush energy plan might have been a factor in raising his job-disapproval rating from 31% a week ago to 36% now, the highest of his presidency. His 56% job-approval rating did not change from a week ago. ??Bush's strongest disapproval came from Democrats, low-income earners, women under 50 and residents of California, a state wrestling with electricity shortages. ??California Democratic Gov. Gray Davis was highly critical of the Bush plan. He said it ""does nothing to address the astronomical run-up in the prices of electricity, natural gas and gasoline (and) favors more energy production at the expense of everything else."" ??White House spokesman Claire Buchan said the president will continue to press his plan, regardless of the polls: ""The president does not govern by polls. This is a serious issue that has been neglected for years, and he has begun a serious dialogue with the American people. It will continue."" ??Most poll respondents said they see threats of electricity shortages and the rising price of gasoline and heating fuels as serious problems, although only 12% said they see a ""state of crisis."" And most of those polled said Bush is not doing enough to address those problems. ??At the same time, most said energy companies have too much influence over the administration's energy polices, an argument Democrats raise. ??One in five said the Bush administration deserves a great deal of blame for the energy problems; 28% put a great deal of that blame on the Clinton administration.

The plant, owned by local power wholesaler Pinnacle West Energy, will produce enough electricity to serve about 120,000 homes, though much of it may be sold elsewhere. ??On Monday, PG&E National Energy Group, a sister of California's financially squeezed PG&E Gas and Electric, broke ground for its planned $500 million generating plant west of Phoenix that will use natural gas. ??It's one of up to 11 plants planned for Arizona by out-of-state interests. Three such plants are expected to begin production this summer, though much of their power also may be sold to other states. ??That's true of the PG&E National plant, too, but those who live in the vicinity don't care. ??""We have nothing out here now,"" said Elisa Bigbey of Harquahala Valley. ""We want to get something going."" ??The plant will increase the assessed valuation of the area by 17 times and will generate $10.7 million in new property taxes. PG&E already has given the local school district a portable shed in which to store records because the district's only school was damaged by a November fire. ??PG&E also is making a no-strings outright gift to the community of $550,000 in 11 annual cash installments. A committee of local residents will decide how to spend the windfall. ??Meanwhile, Panda Energy of Dallas and Teco Power Services of Tampa, Fla., recently broke ground for a plant south of the PG&E site, and Duke Energy North America of Charlotte, N.C., and Sempra Energy of San Diego each have started plants in the Arlington Valley. ??Pinnacle West Generating has a plant under construction near the Palo Verde nuclear plant in this same general area. ??Additionally, the Desert Basin Plant in Casa Grande is owned by Reliant Energy of Houston. The Griffith Energy Plant near Kingman is owned by Duke Energy and P&L Global. The Southpoint plant, set to begin production next month near Bullhead City, is owned by Calpine Corp. of San Jose. ??Such plants have come to Arizona because there's lot of space in Arizona, water is relatively inexpensive, there's access to natural gas, regulators are friendly and the plants can be situated at a distance from urban air pollution controls. ??The PG&E plant will produce nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxides that can lead to formation of ozone, an air pollution problem against Phoenix has been fighting for years. ??Additionally, the plant will use 6,500 acre feet of water a year, enough to meet the needs of a town of about 30,000. PG&E expects to use surplus Central Arizona Project water from the distant Colorado River - but the Harquahala Valley has a good supply of underground water PG&E can tap if the CAP surplus disappears.

The Bureau of State Audits also criticized the California Public Utilities Commission, saying the commission hasn't responded to the crisis by expediting transmission line project. ??- Gov. Gray Davis is in Chicago, speaking with city officials there about blackout procedures. ??- Davis' energy advisers say that the state is meeting its energy goals, despite doubts raised by Controller Kathleen Connell and other critics. Connell questioned whether the state can buy enough electricity cheap enough to avoid borrowing more than the $13.4 billion approved by state lawmakers. But Davis adviser Joe Fichera says the state has signed more long-term power contracts that will help keep prices low. ??- Davis' office announces that an eighth ""peaker"" power plant has been licensed. The 135-megawatt plant in Gilroy is expected to be online by the end of September. The California Energy Commission says that more than 10,000 megawatts of new electricity since April 1999. ??- The California Energy Commission also announces increased rebates for renewable energy systems - such as solar panels, fuel cells or small wind generation. Rebates of up to 50 percent on the system are available for residential, commercial, industrial or agricultural users. ??- Republican legislative leaders criticize Davis for spending tax money on a political communications firm that previously advised Vice President Al Gore. Davis is hiring Gore's former press secretary and deputy campaign manager for six months at $30,000 a month to coordinate the governor's communications on energy issues. Senate GOP Leader Jim Brulte and Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox say Davis should pay them with campaign funds, not taxpayers' money. ??- Shares of Edison International closed at $11.23, down 51 cents. PG&E Corp. dropped 48 cents to close at $11.16. ??WHAT'S NEXT: ??- Davis' representatives continue negotiating with Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas and Electric Co., to buy the utility's transmission lines. ??- Davis is scheduled to sign a bill Tuesday that would expedite power plant siting. ??- Republican Assemblyman Mike Briggs plans to introduce a bill that would allow people to know a month ahead if they will be affected by rolling blackouts. ??THE PROBLEM: ??High demand, high wholesale energy costs, transmission glitches and a tight supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in the Northwest and maintenance at aging California power plants are all factors in California's electricity crisis. ??Edison and PG&E say they've lost nearly $14 billion since June to high wholesale prices the state's electricity deregulation law bars them from passing on to consumers. PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. ??Electricity and natural gas suppliers, scared off by the two companies' poor credit ratings, are refusing to sell to them, leading the state in January to start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and business customers. The state is also buying power for a third investor-owned utility, San Diego Gas & Electric, which is in better financial shape than much larger Edison and PG&E but also struggling with high wholesale power costs. ??The Public Utilities Commission has approved average rate increases of 36 percent for residential customers and 38 percent for commercial customers, and hikes of up to 49 percent for industrial customers and 15 or 20 percent for agricultural customers to help finance the state's multibillion-dollar power buys.

BODY: ??The operator of California's electricity grid is offering a partial answer to a major consumer complaint, planning to give the public a half-hour's warning before shutting off the lights. ??Beginning May 30, the Independent System Operator also plans to issue warnings similar to weather advisories 24 hours before expected blackouts. ??Up to now, the agency has refused to give more than a few minutes' warning, saying it did not want to alarm people when there was still a chance that a last-minute purchase of power could stave off blackouts. The utilities have also resisted giving warnings, saying they did not want to tip off burglars and other criminals. ??""Definitely, it's a good idea,"" said Shirley Starr, a racetrack employee in the Los Angeles suburb of Rosemead. ""If I know it's going to happen, I won't defrost the refrigerator or something."" ??Like some business customers and consumer groups, she wondered if 30 minutes warning would be enough. ??""A lot of people, if they are at work, a half hour isn't going to do any good,"" Starr said. ??""I think it should be more than 30 minutes,"" said George Aguilar, an animal control officer in El Monte. ""It should be at least eight hours."" ??Californians have been warned that rolling blackouts could be a regular feature this summer. The state's power system, crippled by a botched effort at deregulation, has been unable to produce or buy enough electricity to power air conditioners on hot days. ??The rolling blackouts move from neighborhood to neighborhood in a sequence that is determined by the utilities and is difficult or impossible for the public to predict. The outages last 60 to 90 minutes and then skip to another neighborhood. ??Because of the lack of notice, the six days of rolling blackouts to hit the state so far this year have led to pileups at intersections suddenly left without stoplights, trapped people in elevators, and caused business losses by bringing production lines to a halt. People with home medical equipment like oxygen fret they that they will be cut off without warning. ??The new plan by the ISO borrows from the language of weather forecasters: It will issue a ""power watch"" or ""power warning"" that will give notice the grid could be headed toward blackouts. ??The ISO will issue 30-minute warning to the media and others before any blackouts actually begin. However, the ISO will not say what neighborhoods will be hit. ??""It's better than no notice,"" said John Handley of California Independent Grocers. ??He said stores could use the warning to rush customers through checkout and even move items to cold storage if necessary. ??""Once the power goes out, we can't ring anyone up,"" Handley said. ??Many small factories have production lines that cannot be interrupted without risk to an entire lot of whatever they produce, said Brad Ward, president and chief executive of the Small Manufacturers Association of California. ??For example, a manufacturer might be using acid to etch something on a piece of metal. If power is shut off suddenly, the acid might not be removed in time and the piece would be ruined. ??""This is really, really good news,"" Ward said. ??The ISO said it also is looking into high-tech ways it can get word of an impending blackout quickly to homeowners and businesses through mass e-mails, faxes, automated phone calls and pager messages. ??On the Net: ??California Independent System Operator: http://www.caiso.com LOAD-DATE: May 22, 2001 of 85 DOCUMENTS 2001 Associated Press Online 21, 2001; Monday SECTION: Domestic, non-Washington, general news item LENGTH: 793 words HEADLINE: ?AP Top News at 7 p.m. EDT Monday, May 21, 2001 BYLINE: ADAM JOYCE BODY: ??Ford to Recall Millions of Tires ??WASHINGTON (AP) ??Ford Motor Co. plans to replace 10 million to 13 million Firestone tires, far surpassing the already huge recall ordered last summer by Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., auto industry sources told The Associated Press today. Ford CEO Jacques Nasser said he would make an announcement tomorrow about ''actions to address'' issues involving Firestone Wilderness AT tires.

Fund-raising watchdogs said Cheney's use of his residence was no different from President Clinton's use of the White House for fund-raising, which became the focus of Republican-led congressional inquiries. But a Republican National Committee spokesman said the Cheney event ''is not a fund-raiser.'' ??GOP Set to Complete Tax Bill ??WASHINGTON (AP) ??Even before tonight's expected Senate passage, the Bush administration and congressional Republicans were looking ahead to rewriting the 11-year, $1.35 trillion tax cut plan in negotiations set to begin tomorrow. The bill was to be sent to a House-Senate conference committee, where conservatives will push to accelerate income tax cuts and to slash the top 39.6 percent income tax rate more deeply than the 36 percent called for in the measure. ??California to Forecast Blackouts ??SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) ??The operator of the state's electricity grid said today it will start issuing forecasts 24 hours ahead of expected rolling blackouts. The agency also promised to give 30 minutes' warning before it orders utilities to pull the plug on homes and businesses, a move that could prevent traffic accidents, stuck elevators and costly shutdowns at factories. The state's power system, crippled by a botched effort at deregulation, has been unable to produce or buy enough electricity to power air conditioners on hot days. ??Powell Calls for Mideast Talks ??WASHINGTON (AP) ??Secretary of State Colin Powell today endorsed recommendations aimed at ending the violence between Israel and the Palestinians, and he appointed U.S. diplomat William Burns to shepherd a resumption of talks.

It also banned cab drivers from talking on cellphones while driving, or as city officials put it, ''No Yakking While Hacking!'' concludes the study from the agency's compliance programs branch. ??___ ??Energy Group: Ontario Consumers Must Be Wary on Electricity Rebate ??TORONTO (AP) ??Ontario consumers may be unwittingly signing away a valuable rebate on their electricity prices to private utility companies, says the head of an energy watchdog group. ??The Market Power Mitigation rebate was created in 1999 to offset a potential rise in power prices once Ontario's electricity market is opened to competition, sometime next spring. ??Sales representatives from private electricity marketing companies have been knocking on Ontario doors for months, asking homeowners to sign on for a fixed electricity rate when the market opens. ??Tom Adams, director of Energy Probe, says consumers may not notice a fine-print clause which, in many of the agreements, hands the potential rebate over to the electricity firm. ??While there may be nothing wrong with such a clause, consumers by and large don't even know it or the rebate exists, Adams says. ??''If the price is right, it's a balanced transaction, but the problem is nobody has any information, and the public agencies aren't doing their job of explaining it to us.'' ??The rebate is supposed to kick in for consumers when the yearly average cost of electricity for a household rises above a benchmark price of 3.8 cents per kilowatt hour. ??The rebate is designed to shield consumers from massive price spikes such as those seen in Alberta and California, where deregulated markets have recently seen a tripling of prices and rolling blackouts. ??___ ??Man Accused of Killing Alberta Girl Is Due in Court ??LETHBRIDGE, Alberta (AP) ??Sylvia Koopmans was bracing Monday for the moment when she would face the family friend charged with the murder of her youngest daughter. ??Koopmans said she planned to attend Tuesday's first court appearance of Harold Anthony Gallup, 31, who is charged with the kidnapping and first-degree murder of five-year-old Jessica. ??''I need to be there,'' said Koopmans, who planned to watch the provincial court proceeding supported by her boyfriend and her father. ??''I need him to see me ...

It is at once a triumph of technology and Western gumption, and a reminder of how tenuous it all is. ??The great growth in the West followed a simple recipe: Water plus power equals population. There was always a feeling that the land was so big you couldn't use it up, not the resources, not the space. ??Today there are signs that's no longer true. In California, blackouts. In Oregon and Washington, drought. In Arizona, arsons to stop construction. And in every rearview mirror, more traffic all the time. ??The allure of vast prairies, open skies and endless opportunity is what first drew people out West. But as deserts disappear under development, possibilities become problems. ??Now, with its infrastructure strained by growth, the West faces difficult choices: Energy or environment? Freeways or orchards? Water for people or fish? ??""We're losing what we've come for, this ideal,"" says James Corless, California director of the Surface Transportation Policy Project, which aims to diversify transportation systems to reduce traffic and pollution caused by growth. ""And we are loath to change."" ??--- ??When the streets went dark in California, a light bulb came on across the West. ??The region saw its vulnerability. For one very important resource, demand had won out over supply. What about all the others? ??""We've got an infrastructure that can't really carry much additional power. We're starting to see the same situation with water,"" says John Maddox, president of the Denver-based Center for the New West. ??And people keep coming. ??The West added more than 10 million people in the 1990s, making it the fastest-growing region in the United States. In the next decade, another 10 million are expected. ??""What does that mean?"" Maddox says. ""How many new roads, new water infrastructure and treatment facilities, how many new runways and airports?"" ??Perhaps more than clogged freeways and periodic droughts, the power crisis has brought home the reality that there are limits to growth. ??In California, electricity consumption rose 24 percent in the past five years as the economy grew by 29 percent. However, no major new plants were built in the state in the past 10 years, according to Cambridge Energy Research Associates. ??Several projects to generate new power were shelved in the 1990s, because of regulatory red-tape, environmental protests, economics and wariness over the state's deregulation plan. ??As a result, the power ran low and California was forced to go to the open market in search of electricity, sending power rates soaring and shutting out the lights in rolling blackouts. ??California officials now predict it will take two to three years before energy production catches up with demand. ??Meanwhile, the crisis has crossed state lines. In the Northwest, generating capacity grew 4 percent in the 1990s, while demand grew 24 percent. That wasn't a problem when abundant rain and snow produced above-average hydropower generation between 1995 and 2000. ??Then drought hit, and generation dropped. Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana are about 3,000 megawatts short of the electricity they need. ??Now everyone's playing catch-up. California is on a plant-building spree, while other states are pushing conservation and looking for alternative fuel sources. ??Even in power-hungry Las Vegas, the mega-resorts are cutting back. The MGM Grand refitted its 5,000 guest rooms with low-watt fluorescent bulbs and changed its casino-floor lighting. Treasure Island's parking garage is switching to sodium bulbs that use 30 percent less energy. ??But a feeling of dread is gripping some Westerners. If the lights can go out, what's next? Dry faucets? ??""The thing I worry about is water,"" says Carol Ann Heggie-Hall, a retired science teacher who moved from Queens, N.Y., to Henderson, Nev., in 1999. ""Is there enough water for everyone and their plants?"" ??Much of the West is facing the worst drought in a quarter-century, prompting warnings of environmental degradation, forest fires and agricultural decline. Nevertheless, experts say the West isn't in danger of running out of water. The challenge is determining who gets how much. ??""It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that if the faucets ran dry in Scottsdale, there are places to go to get water,"" says Joe Hunter, a power and water specialist at the Center for the New West. ""But it means shifting it from one use to another."" ??About 80 percent of water in most Western states is used to irrigate crops, a percentage that could drop if residential supplies were strained, Hunter says. ??Western states and cities must also do more to share water. ??California has long used more than its allocation from the Colorado River, which supplies drinking water to seven Western states. An agreement allows California to receive surplus water if it implements conservation measures that will reduce its reliance on the river in the future. ??In the meantime, Western cities are looking elsewhere to sustain the supply. The Las Vegas Valley predicts it will reach its annual Colorado River allocation by 2007, so its regional water authority is negotiating to store 1.2 million acre feet of water in Arizona for the next 15 years. ??Beyond power and water, other infrastructure problems persist. In the Vegas area, which added 700,000 people in the '90s, road closures due to highway expansions are a daily occurrence. ??""There are few roads you can drive on that aren't under construction,"" admits Jim Gibson, mayor of Henderson, a city south of Vegas that is among the country's most rapidly growing communities. ??Without the new roads, Vegas transportation officials estimate there would be 2,289 miles of congestion by the year 2025, compared with 341 miles last year. ??Highways alleviate congestion, but also drive more growth. ??Interstate 5, the north-south freeway through Washington and Oregon, became a growth magnet. In Colorado, Interstate 70 has opened the mountains to staggering growth west of Denver. ??-- ??In the fastest-growing metro area in the fastest-growing state in the fastest-growing region of the country, Greg Cox and Dale Stark are unloading dirt on a Las Vegas street crammed with construction workers. ??The landscapers are a rare breed in a town teeming with newcomers: Cox has lived here all his life; Stark moved from Southern California in 1979. ??Both grumble about the changes they've seen, and both vow to leave. ??""I moved here when this town was nice,"" Stark says. ""Now you can't drive down the road without getting cut off and flipped off."" ??Cox complains he can barely get around at all. A drive across town used to take 20 minutes. Now, he grunts, ""You've got to pack a lunch."" ??Both agree: Even Las Vegas, the city built on the very idea of unlimited resources and space, is reaching its limits. ??The sentiment is spreading across the West: Unbridled growth must stop. ??Planning experts insist cities must reinvest in old neighborhoods rather than build new ones, and provide incentive to plan for growth in a way that incorporates existing infrastructure. ??Portland, Ore., has been a national leader with its urban growth boundary. In San Francisco, a program provides federal money to developers who build homes near transit stops. ??Still, when initiatives to rein in growth were placed on the ballot in several Western states last November, most of the big measures failed - including one in Arizona to force developers to pay for new infrastructure. Opponents warned that growth controls would be bad for business. ??In Las Vegas, despite infrastructure challenges, the official line remains that growth is good. ??""As long as you can take care of the social problems and quality of life problems, there's never such a thing as too much growth,"" declares Mayor Oscar Goodman. ""Once you stop growing, you stagnate."" ??And so for now, the fountains flow, the marquees shine. ??And the people keep coming. ??On the Net: ??Center for the New West: www.newwest.org/ ??Sierra Club sprawl campaign: ??Census stats: ??Las Vegas growth topics website: ??Surface Transportation Policy Project: http://www.transact.org/ ??Brookings Institution's Center on Urban and Metropolitan Policy: ??EDITOR'S NOTE - Pauline Arrillaga is the AP's Southwest regional writer, based in Phoenix. ??End ADV for May 26-27 GRAPHIC: AP Photos NY372-375 of May 21, AP Graphic WESTERN GROWTH, AP LOAD-DATE: May 22, 2001 of 85 DOCUMENTS Associated Press The materials in the AP file were compiled by The Associated Press. ?These materials may not be republished without the express written consent of The Associated Press. ????????????????????????May 21, 2001, Monday, BC cycle SECTION: Domestic News; Business News LENGTH: 648 words HEADLINE: California will forecast blackouts and warn the public BYLINE: By JENNIFER COLEMAN, Associated Press Writer DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif.

And if generators don't lower the price, the state should schedule blackouts to cut consumption, he said. ??The report by Navarro and the Utility Consumers' Action Network says the state's current method of ""highly disruptive random rolling blackouts"" needs to be revamped. ??UCAN suggests that the state be divided into blackout zones that utilities could notify ahead of time that power would be cut at a specific time and for a certain duration. ??Scheduling blackouts could attract criminals to outage areas, Keeley acknowledged, and possibly could subject the state to legal liability for traffic accidents or other incidents if power is deliberately shut off. ??""That is a genuine problem and genuine concern,"" Keeley said. ""I think we would have to work with local governments so they could have a sufficient advance notice to be able to foresee that and try to deploy their resources appropriately."" ??Critics of the planned blackouts said power producers simply could sell their unused electricity to other states, or trim back production to keep supplies short. ??Assemblyman Mike Briggs, R-Fresno, plans to introduce a bill this week that would have the Public Utilities Commission notify businesses and homeowners as much as one month ahead of time when they would have their power cut. ??""We owe the people of this state some kind of schedule,"" Briggs said.

Democratic Assembly members plan to introduce their own version of a blackout plan. ??Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey, has said she envisions giving consumers three to five days notice that their power will be cut during a particular period, so businesses could opt to shut down or shift their operations to nonpeak hours such as nights and weekends. ??And by treating blackouts as a first option rather than a last resort, the state could cut its peak power needs and drive down prices, Bowen said. California power consumers would in essence form ""a reverse cartel to stop the market manipulation and the price gouging,"" she said. ??The planned blackout suggestions come as state officials grow increasingly concerned that power prices will keep rising this summer, even beyond the extraordinary levels the state already has been paying on behalf of three cash-strapped privately owned utilities. ??Gov. Gray Davis said the state paid $1,900 per megawatt hour at one point last week. ??The state has dedicated $6.7 billion since mid-January to purchase power for Pacific Gas and Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric. ??Those expenditures will be repaid this summer when the state issues $13.4 billion in revenue bonds. The bonds will be repaid by ratepayers over 15 years. ??--- ??On the Net: ??California Independent System Operator: http://www.caiso.com/ LOAD-DATE: May 22, 2001 of 85 DOCUMENTS ???????????????????The Associated Press State & Local Wire The materials in the AP file were compiled by The Associated Press. ?These materials may not be republished without the express written consent of The Associated Press. ????????????????????????May 21, 2001, Monday, BC cycle SECTION: State and Regional LENGTH: 901 words HEADLINE: 'Baseline' becoming key word for electric customers BYLINE: By KAREN GAUDETTE, Associated Press Writer DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO BODY: ??A little calculation on electric bills is fast becoming a big concern for millions of residential customers of California's two largest utilities. ??Sitting near the top of Southern California Edison electric bills, and near the bottom of the last page of Pacific Gas and Electric bills, is a number called baseline, which guarantees a certain amount of electricity at the lowest price utilities charge. ??This number, which differs from customer to customer based on a host of factors, is the benchmark for determining how much more residents will pay for electricity come June - when the largest rate hikes in California history start showing up on bills. ??""Now with deregulation and prices being so much higher, it's going to require that people educate themselves about their bills the same way they had to do when long distance telephone service was deregulated,"" said Commissioner Carl Wood of the Public Utilities Commission. ??Under a rate-hike allocation plan approved Tuesday by the PUC, everyone who exceeds baseline by more than 30 percent will pay progressively more for that additional electricity - with the heaviest residential users facing a 37 percent average hike on their overall bill, translating to an increase of roughly $85 a month. ??State law ensures that residential customers who don't use more than 30 percent above baseline will not face the rate hikes. The PUC figures around half of PG&E and Edison customers now fall into that category. ??But consumer rights groups, and even the utilities, think the PUC is underestimating residential electric use, given the recent proliferation of home computers, cell phone chargers and the like. ??They think baseline is set too low for many customers, and say families and people who work at home will pay more than their fair share of the rate hikes. ??""It's an anti-family action. People with kids have a hard time staying within baseline,"" said Mike Florio, senior attorney with The Utility Reform Network. ""A rate hike of 30 to 40 percent could be 100 percent for people with large households."" ??Since 1982, when lawmakers created baseline - given in cents per kilowatt hour per month - to ensure a minimum amount of affordable power and encourage conservation, the PUC has determined baseline by dividing the state into climatic and geographic regions. ??PG&E has 10 such regions within its service territory in northern and central California; Edison has six in central and southern California. ??The PUC then finds the average amount of electricity use for customers within each region. The baseline quantity is 50 percent to 60 percent of that amount, and up to 70 percent of that amount during the winter months if a customer uses only one type of energy (electricity or natural gas). ??Customers who depend on electronic medical equipment such as suction, breathing and dialysis machines, can apply for a slightly higher baseline. ??A family living in the scorching hot Coachella Valley would have a larger allotment of lower-priced electricity than a family living in breezy Monterey, given that air conditioning for the former is necessary to survival. ??Since baseline is based on averages, a single apartment dweller and a family of four who live in the same region could have the same baseline. That makes it more likely for the family to get hit with rate hikes and less likely, economists fear, that the apartment dweller has a financial incentive to conserve. ??""Where it is imperfect is that it has no ability to make any adjustments for the size of the family,"" said John Nelson, a PG&E spokesman. ??Focusing baseline on household size gets complicated, Florio said. ""Does PG&E come by and do bed checks?"" ??Along with raising $5.7 billion to replenish the state's general fund for power buys since January, the rate hikes approved March 27 by the PUC and allocated on Tuesday were also meant to trigger conservation that could help avoid rolling blackouts this summer. ??Baseline has not been reassessed since the early 1990s. PUC president Loretta Lynch and fellow commissioner Wood say they may hold hearings as early as this coming week on possible inequities and ways to update the system. ??""There was plenty of testimony at public hearings that people suspect that baselines are not appropriate or are not calculated right,"" Wood said. ??Wood said when baseline first was created nearly 20 years ago, houses were smaller and many lacked central air conditioning. ??Though the PUC has updated baseline amounts through the years, ""living standards have changed, housing standards have changed and it may be that average usage is different from what it was,"" Wood said. ??Florio said giving baselines a second look could go either way for consumers. There are typically more electronic gadgets in homes these days, but many of those gadgets and appliances are more energy efficient than their ancestors. ??Add that to increased conservation statewide, Florio said, and there's a slim chance baselines could actually go down and expose more customers to rate hikes. ??""It's a percentage of average use historically, and people have used energy more efficiently,"" through the years, Florio said. ??--- ??On the Net: ??California Public Utilities Commission: http://www.cpuc.ca.gov ??Pacific Gas and Electric Co.: http://www.pge.com ??Southern California Edison Co.: http://www.sce.com LOAD-DATE: May 22, 2001 of 85 DOCUMENTS ???????????????????The Associated Press State & Local Wire The materials in the AP file were compiled by The Associated Press. ?These materials may not be republished without the express written consent of The Associated Press. ????????????????????????May 21, 2001, Monday, BC cycle SECTION: State and Regional LENGTH: 273 words HEADLINE: New poll suggests Californians haven't been this gloomy for years DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO BODY: ??Not since the mid-'90s have more Californians believed the state is headed in the wrong direction. ??And it may get worse. ?Nearly 60 percent of state residents expect the economy to worsen in the next year, while about 40 percent see a brighter horizon, according to a new poll. ??The telephone survey of 2,001 adult Californians was done over eight days in early May by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California. The poll was conducted in English and Spanish. ??The twin culprits were the souring economy and the electricity crisis. ??""Californians clearly see the electricity crisis as a harbinger of other growth-related problems,"" said Mark Baldassare, the research institute's survey director. ""This crisis and general economic uncertainty have severely undermined public confidence in California's future and in its leaders."" ??Change has come swiftly. ??In January, 62 percent of state residents said California was headed in the right direction, compared to 48 percent this month. ??Other key findings include: ??-82 percent of respondents said population growth over the next 20 years will make California a less desirable place to live. ??-86 percent of respondents said the electricity crisis will hurt the state's economy. ??-43 percent of respondents favor building more power plants, up from 32 percent in January.

Headlines proclaimed a ""crisis,"" and legislative leaders shifted into an ""I told you so"" mode. ??Hold the phone. ??This is not California. There is no crisis. Customers with interruptible service contracts have always been subject to cutoffs in times of peak consumption or when generators are down. ??It may not be fair to suggest that Alliant Energy chose to idle three of its biggest generators to make the case for changing the law, but the timing is nonetheless convenient. The Legislature is set to convene a special session in a few weeks, and among the business left over from the regular session could be a bill to make it easier for power companies to build electric generating plants. ??While crisis is not imminent, Iowa does face the prospect of consuming more electricity than the state's utilities are able to generate themselves. ... ??While Iowa's law may need some ""streamlining,"" which could be dealt with in a special session, that should not be the end of the matter. Ultimately, the Legislature must fashion a long-range energy policy for this state that takes a regional view of energy, that reflects new market and regulation realities, and that seizes the potential for conservation and renewable alternatives to fossil fuels. ??Legislative session: ??TELEGRAPH HERALD ??Even after a marathon legislative session - this one lasted 121 days - why does it always seem the big-ticket items are pushed through in the final days? ??This year's session started out strong, passing a bill to save taxpayers money by eliminating the sales tax on residential utility bills. It finished up by coming through with $40 million for teachers' pay. ??But just what happened in those middle 100 or so days is a little murky. There was plenty of hand-wringing about the budget shortfall, the usual banter about dove hunting and a fair amount of partisan bickering. ... ??-Legislators didn't get around to a ... bill to close a loophole in Iowa's Open Records law. The way it stands now, a governmental body can use a private contractor to investigate problems within the department and keep that contractor's report confidential under the law's whistle-blower provision. ... ??-The Legislature didn't want to get into a full-blown gambling debate, so it didn't address a tax freeze at racetracks. ... The issue of fairness needs to be addressed. ??Floating casinos pay a 20 percent tax, while racetracks pay a gradually increasing tax that now stands at 30 percent. Under the law enacted in 1997, that tax will grow to 36 percent by 2004. ??-Other things that legislators talked about but didn't get around to include: cutting state income tax on Social Security income and a pair of bills addressing the state's bottle-deposit law. ??So the 2002 Legislature will have its work cut out for it. Here are some jobs for next year's to-do list: ??-Amend the Open Records Law. Allowing agencies to keep information about government activities secret simply because it is in the possession of an outside contractor is a hole in the law that needs to be fixed. ??-Carry the ball on increasing teachers' pay. The $40 million shot in the arm will have been a waste if the program is left hanging unfunded. ??-Freeze the amount of tax racetracks pay where it stands and stop the hemorrhaging of dollars into state coffers. The disparity between racetracks and riverboat casinos needs to be righted. ??And if they're worried that the discussion will draw an all-out gambling debate, lawmakers might want to bring it to the table before May. ??IOWA CITY PRESS-CITIZEN: ??We agree with Gov. Tom Vilsack that the new state budget approved by legislators ""will cause hardship for people and families across our state."" ??That's what happens when you face a $300 million revenue shortfall, and you don't have as much money as you wanted. ??But we disagree that ""for 3 1/2 months, they did very little."" ??On the contrary, Vilsack got what he said all along would be the high mark of this session - $40 million for teacher pay raises and a new system for teacher pay. ??And the Republican-led Legislature also agreed to phase out the sales tax on utilities, long a goal of Vilsack's Democratic Party. ??Are we happy with the budget? No. ??Is it the best we likely can do under the circumstances? Yes. ??Vilsack should sign budget legislation, rather than vetoing it and calling a special session of the Legislature this summer. ... ??Plant Sciences Institute: ??DES MOINES REGISTER: ??Iowa needs more people, especially young people. Iowa needs more jobs that pay well - the kinds of jobs that cause other businesses, small and large, to spring up here. So why did Iowa lawmakers blow the single best opportunity for both? ??They blame it on a tight budget. Blame them for failing to grasp the big picture. The fledgling Plant Sciences Institute at Iowa State University could become a major force in the fast-growing field of biotechnology related to agriculture - yet the 2001 Legislature provided no new money. ??It did continue the $4.67 million approved in 2000. It did not add $3 million, a meager increase proposed by the governor. It allowed ISU to keep money from the sale of land, with proceeds to be used for the institute's Roy J. Carver Co-Laboratory, to be completed by 2002. It should have added at least $10 million in cash. ... ??Because of legislative inaction, promising initiatives must slow down, or may never take place. ... ??The institute had hoped to hire another top researcher in the field of corn genomics ... ??Ag-biotech companies have been appealing to the state for help putting together a protein-extraction facility ... Such a facility might extract protein from conventional or genetically modified plants for such uses as pharmaceuticals, food additives or chemical enzymes for industrial processes. The Plant Sciences Institute has a small, pilot protein-extraction facility. New money from the Legislature would have allowed it to assist businesses in establishing a commercial facility. But now? ""The people interested in this will probably go elsewhere,"" said Director Stephen Howell. ??Why wouldn't they? Plenty of other states are serious about fostering biotech industries. The Iowa commitment is hardly encouraging. ... ??Iowa has a budget crunch because its economy and population are not growing fast enough. Investing in biotechnology - the technology that is expected to drive the next great wave of economic growth - is the most promising way to make Iowa's economy and population grow. Stinting on that investment is stunningly shortsighted. ??Ten million dollars next session should not be out of the question. The question should be what sort of future will Iowa have if it does not make the most of the potential the Plant Sciences Institute holds. ??Hunting requirements: ??AMES TRIBUNE: ??In April, the Iowa House and Senate rejected a measure that would have required wild turkey hunters to report their harvest to the Department of Natural Resources, saying it was ""just another hassle,"" for hunters. ??Then, the House hiked the fees for hunting licenses, in some cases up to 218 percent. A non-resident who wants to hunt deer in Iowa under this plan will have to shell out $308, including a hunting license and habitat fee. The current total is $156. ??Hassle? You got it. We might as well hang a sign on Iowa borders that says we don't much care about managing our wildlife and we don't want you here, either. Add to the mix a federal whammy in the Freedom to Farm Act, which has all but eliminated any fence rows, and hunting as a potential tourism draw to Iowa blows away in the wind. ... ??Instead of having accurate information on how much hunting is affecting turkey populations, Department of Natural Resources wildlife managers are now left to guess. ... ??Surrounding states which capitalize on their resources require even more harvest registration, and it hasn't slowed interest. ... ??The DNR asked for the fee increases for good reasons - license fees have not increased for a decade while the costs of salaries, travel and equipment have begun to eat into funds available for facilities and land acquisition. And we're in favor of using fees to support wildlife management. ??We also would allow that some of the increases do not seem to us to be egregious. A $3 fish habitat fee for instance, isn't a great deal to pay. Nor is a $30 tab for a non-resident 7-day fishing license out of line. ??But some fee hikes were too much. ??In particular, the non-resident fees for deer hunting are high especially in comparison to surrounding states, and are more than most ordinary people are likely to pay. Wisconsin charges non-residents $135 to hunt deer. Missouri charges $125. License fees in Iowa are likely to result in less money coming in, not more. What out-of-state hunter will be drawn to Iowa when surrounding states are managing their herds better and charging less to visit? ??Iowa worries that the farm economy is in the tank. We wring our hands as our young people rush to other parts of the country. We say that our natural resources here can be an attraction that will draw people back. Yet these votes run counter to sound wildlife management and increased tourism. ??Public official recruits: ??QUAD-CITY TIMES: ??More Iowa school districts and local governments are using professional companies to help find high-level administrators such as superintendents, but that recruiting tool is making the process less accountable to the public. ??In effect, it allows private firms to dictate public policy, and that's troubling. ??One example of this trend is the Camanche School District, where six finalists for the superintendents job were in town for interviews recently. They met with school board members, district staff and some residents, yet the board does not intend to reveal the names of the candidates. The Cedar Rapids headhunter firm that has contracted with the district advised the school board not to announce the names. ??Headhunters also are advising candidates to request their names be kept confidential. Under Iowa law, a public entity such as a school board must honor such a request. ??Some public officials justify this secrecy by arguing that finalists don't want the public to know if they didn't get the job offer or worry that identification may jeopardize their current position. ... ??Those arguments aren't justified, for reasons including: ??-There is nothing dishonorable in not being chosen for a top-level post. Indeed, being considered a finalist for such a job may serve only to enhance a candidates attractiveness for another position ... ??-Identifying the finalists for the public also allows citizens to ask questions and provide other information, critical or supportive, that could be useful in helping officials make a final choice. ??-And being upfront with the public lends credibility to the entire process ... ??We prefer a process similar to one used by the City of Clinton during its recent search for a city administrator. The five finalists were not only identified, they took part in an open house to meet the public. A headhunter firm was used, but City Attorney Bruce Johansen, himself a candidate who did not get the job, said he made it clear to the agency that the finalists names should be made public. ??We applaud that effort ... ??Meanwhile, the Iowa Legislature this spring modified a state law that has been the basis of confidentiality claims for candidates seeking public positions. The change would require that official communication between private contractors and the public entities they serve be open to public inspection. Whether that law will be interpreted to include headhunter firms remains to be seen. ... ??We encourage school boards and local governments to resist confidentiality and test the new law when it takes effect July 1. ??Train service: ??CEDAR RAPIDS GAZETTE: ??Who'd have thought that the selection of the secretary of the federal Department of Human Services last winter might affect whether Davenport, Iowa City and Des Moines get rail service. ??But consider that HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson, who resigned recently from the Amtrak board, had been a strong advocate of expanded rail service here in the Midwest while he was governor of Wisconsin. Thompson had hoped to remain chairman of the Amtrak board after he went to Washington. But the Associated Press reports that a 1997 law that restructured the Amtrak board says only one of the seven seats can be held by a member of the Cabinet - and the Bush administration wants Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta on the governing board. ??Few people around are as passionate as Thompson about Amtrak, and Iowa could have benefited. It's hard to ride a national passenger train service that doesn't go where the majority of Iowans live. Maybe the service will be expanded here. But maybe, with the changes in the governing board, that train has already left the station. ??Smoker identification: ??LE MARS DAILY SENTINAL: ??Have you heard the news from Walgreen's? They're going to card everybody who wants to buy a package of cigarettes, a box of cigars, a can of chew. ??Everybody. Not under 18. Not 27 and under. Everybody. ... ??That can't have been an easy decision. Within a year, they're looking at software that will require clerk's to enter a customer's birth date into a computer before a tobacco sale can be completed. Until then, they're asking their clerks to card everybody. Good for them. ... ??Yes, it will take a little extra time ... Evidently, the owners/corporate bigwigs think the time is well spent if it eliminates the fines and bad publicity. ??A convenience store association spokesman told reporters that other stores are likely to duplicate Walgreen's efforts. Yes. We certainly hope so. ??We all have heard terrible numbers of deaths caused by tobacco, of underage users ... Many, if not most of us, know someone who hacks and coughs, who died from smoking, who cries because someone died from smoking. When you think of them, it doesn't seem so outrageous to card everyone. It seems downright brilliant. ... ??It won't stop it entirely. Young wanna-be-smokers will have somebody older do the buying, or swipe a carton. There will always be a way to get around it, there always is. ??Still, carding everyone says, ""This is important, we mean it and we're not going to make it easy for you.""

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. MARK HAINES, CNBC ANCHOR, SQUAWK BOX: One company that is hurting a lot in all this is PG&E, the parent of Pacific Gas and Electric. They filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April. PG&E has about $9 billion in unrecovered power costs. A California bankruptcy judge says the company cannot raise retail rates to recoup those losses. The stock is on a steep decline this year, trading in the 52 week range of 6 to 32, last at about 11 1/2. Joining us to tell us where things are now and where they could be going, Robert Glynn, PG&E's Chairman and CEO. Mr. Glynn, good to see you again. ROBERT GLYNN, CHAIRMAN & CEO, PG&E: Good morning, Mark. HAINES: So where do we stand now? GLYNN: Well, we're working our way through the federal bankruptcy proceeding, where we affirmatively stepped in order to resolve issues between ourselves and our creditors. We have a plan of reorganization under development and we're getting close to the time when we can begin to share that plan with the creditors who, after all, need to get paid. HAINES: So let's first talk about time. How much time do you think this might take before PG&E emerges from bankruptcy? GLYNN: Well, it's very hard to tell for one reason. There have not been very many utility bankruptcies and I don't know of any that has had these complexities to it. The shortest possible time or shortest likely time that I've heard about has been six to eight months and that's probably shorter than it will take. The longest that I've heard about is about four years and that's an awful lot longer than I want it to take. HAINES: In the meantime you are selling electricity, transmitting and selling electricity on a retail level. Are you still losing money on your operating? GLYNN: Well, the potential area for continuing loss exposure is the issue of whether the California independent system operator is still buying on behalf of our company instead of buying directly on behalf of our customers. And that's an issue that's before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for decision making right now. HAINES: Well, I guess my question is who is paying the bills right now? GLYNN: Well, the electric rates in California have just been raised by the California Public Utilities Commission in order to have the state, the Department of Water Resources be able to recover all of its costs because that's what, of course, it wants to do. It doesn't want to go any deeper in debt than it has to. So this most recent large rate increase has applied, as best as we can tell, exclusively to cover the state's cost increases and not to cover some of the ones that we're responsible for. JOE BATTIPAGLIA: Mr. Glynn, the brownouts continue in California. What's the status of supply of electricity into the state, putting aside for a moment how you pay for it? GLYNN: Well, the California electricity crisis at its heart is a supply shortage and the outlook for this summer and next summer are pretty bleak. Every responsible entity that has reviewed the situation is forecasting that there will be a large number of rolling blackouts occurring over the summer of 2001 and probably 2002 as well, simply because there's not enough power to go around. BATTIPAGLIA: Does that spread from California to other states as the draw down becomes perilous? GLYNN: Well, the California electricity market and the Pacific Northwest markets have had a very nice symbiotic relationship over many, many years shipping power back and forth to one another. That has been interrupted because of the supply shortage in California, which means that California is trying to be a net importer all the time. And it seems like the Pacific Northwest won't have the kind of surplus energy to send south to California that it's had in the past. HAINES: Does this ultimately end with retail electricity distribution transmission and distribution being done by a state authority and no longer by privately held or publicly held companies? GLYNN: I don't think it ends there at all, Mark. And I certainly don't think that it's in the state's interest to try to get into businesses that can be done by private capital when the state has so many other important things to use its capital on, like education and infrastructure. And I do think that this supply shortage has got to be resolved. It's got to be resolved by building new supply. There's simply no alternative to that and that's going to take another couple of years before that new construction is fully completed. HAINES: All right, sir. Thank you very much for the update. We appreciate it. Robber Glynn, PG&E's Chairman and CEO.

DAVID ENSOR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Judy, Ambassador William Burns, the U.S. ambassador to Jordan, who is Mr. Powell's pick to be the next assistant secretary for the Middle East, has been asked to work with other recommendations for Mr. Powell and for President Bush on how the U.S. can best proceed from here, trying to use the recommendations of the Mitchell committee report to try to get the violence to de- escalate, to try to get the two sides talking instead of shooting at each other. ??Here is how Mr. Powell put it today. ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??POWELL: It is now up to the leaders in the region to show that they have heard this clarion call from this committee in a loud-and- clear way, and take actions that are available to them on both sides to let's have a cessation of hostilities, then we can begin the confidence-building measures and move toward negotiations. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??ENSOR: Now this report makes very specific recommendations and urges very specific actions by both sides: in both cases, quite difficult actions. ?First, it calls for the Palestinians and the Israelis to declare an immediate, unconditional cessation of violence. That's the first step, and that's the step that Secretary Powell repeatedly emphasized today must come first and must come right away or else nothing else will work. ??But the report goes on to make specific recommendations. ?For example, it urges that Israel put -- freeze all settlement development, all development of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories. ?It recommends that Israel resume paying the money that's collected in taxes back to the Palestinian Authority. ?It recommends a whole range of action, many of them to be taken by Israel, which the reports says would help bring the tone back to where it needs to be, would help bring the two sides back to where they could once again be negotiating instead of shooting at each other and letting off bombs. ??The -- the secretary, Secretary Powell, said that this is not the time, however, for him to get involved in shuttle diplomacy. ?He wants first to have Ambassador Burns and the others come up with recommendations over the next week, two weeks or three, and then he and the president will try to figure out where the U.S. can go from here. ??But clearly, this is -- clearly, this is a first step by an administration that until now has tried to keep its -- keep its powder a bit dry in the Middle East. ?They are now engaging somewhat, because they're so concerned about the situation out there, Judy. ??WOODRUFF: David, the report, the Mitchell report, suggesting that the Israelis more responsible here, or at least that they have more to do in order to get things back on the peace track than the Palestinians? ENSOR: The report is very even-handed. ?It doesn't blame either side for the situation. ?It, for example, does not blame Ariel Sharon's visit to the Temple Mount for the following Intifada, Intifada II it's been called. ?But it says that there needs to be a series of actions by both sides to bring down the tensions, and if you look at the list of what it's asking for, there are more steps that the Israelis would have to take than the Palestinians. ??WOODRUFF: And David, why is it that the administration is saying at this point that it is not prepared to get back in -- in a -- in a day-to-day way, in an energetically involved way the way the Clinton administration was? ??ENSOR: Well, I think the administration, this administration, feels that the Clinton people got -- got to the point where they were micromanaging the thing a little bit. ?It was too much presidential involvement and it was too much of a day-to-day hand-holding operation. ?They feel they need to hold back a little bit and try to get the parties to talk to each other. ??However, the situation is deteriorating pretty rapidly, and so now they realize they have to have some greater involvement. ?And that's why Ambassador Burns has been asked to prepare these recommendation, Judy. ??WOODRUFF: All right. ?David Ensor reporting for us from the State Department. ??For more on the Middle East conflict, stay with us for a special half-hour report. ?That's beginning at 6:00 p.m. Eastern. ??Now, we turn to questions about the Bush administration's political fund-raising tactics. ?Tonight, Vice President Dick Cheney is scheduled to host some 400 big GOP donors at his official residence in Washington. ?A spokeswoman for the Democrats says that that event smacks of, in her words, hypocrisy. ??The Democrats say the reception at the vice president's home is comparable to Clinton-era events, such as White House coffees and Lincoln Bedroom sleepovers for big donors, which drew heavy criticism from Republicans. ?Among them: presidential candidate George W. Bush. ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??BUSH: I believe they've moved that sign, ""The buck stops here,"" from the Oval Office desk to the buck stops here on the Lincoln Bedroom. ?And that's not good for the country, it's not right. ?We need to have a new look about how we conduct ourselves in office. There's a huge trust. ?I see it all the time when people come up to me and say, ""I don't want you to let me down again."" ??And we can do better than the past administration has done. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??WOODRUFF: Despite that sort of criticism then, the Republicans are defending their fund-raising tactics now. ?Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott had this to say about the reception for big donors at Vice President Cheney's home tonight. ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??SEN. TRENT LOTT (R-MS), MAJORITY LEADER: I'm sure it's being done in an inappropriate way, or Dick Cheney wouldn't -- wouldn't be doing it. ?So if there's any question, I'd suggest you address it to them. ?Unfortunately, I think that most of us will not be able to be there. ?We're going to be here voting, giving tax relief. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??WOODRUFF: Virtually all of those GOP contributors, who will mingle with Vice President Cheney at his home tonight, have given at least $100,000 to the Republican National Committee. ?They will also attend a major RNC fund-raiser tomorrow night that features President Bush as the main speaker and is expected to net some $15 million in soft money. ??Now let's bring in our White House correspondent, Major Garrett. ??Major, tell us about what this event is about tomorrow night. ??MAJOR GARRETT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's the first official Republican National Committee event to honor the president and the first lady, as you said. The targeted haul is $15 million. Republican National Committee officials tell CNN that it's about 70 percent of that 15 million will be soft money. ?About 30 percent will be hard dollars -- that is dollars that are regulated under the existing campaign finance scheme -- and that it is a big event, one that the Republican Party has held for years and years in Washington. ??As for what's happening in the vice president's residence tonight, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer told me this is a way of saying ""Thank you,"" in his words, ""to those Republicans who,"" as Ari Fleischer said, ""did so much to help win the selection."" ??And he draws a distinction with the Clinton-era coffees and sleepovers, describing them as, quote, ""organized schemes to bring people through the gates of the White House to get money or to persuade others to do so."" ??Mark Minor, who is the communications director for the Republican National Committee, also said that no one paid to go to the vice president's residence. No checks will pass between hands there. There is no quid pro quo, and that some people who will be at the vice president's residence tonight are not in fact RNC donors -- Judy. ??WOODRUFF: So, Major, again, clarify the distinction between money events that are given as a thank you and events that are given as an encouragement to give more money. ??GARRETT: Well, it's a distinction this White House wants to draw as clearly as it possibly can. ?In the words of Ari Fleischer, thanking someone, whether it's on government property or not on government property, is a completely legitimate activity for the president or the vice president to engage in. ?The distinction he is drawing is that during the Clinton era people were brought to the White House, to these coffees, and as was disclosed in the Thompson report that was conducted by the Senate investigating that, there was some evidence of actually targeted lists: that people who were brought in, money was described to bringing in for a coffee. ?A certain dollar amount was attached to donations to the Democratic National Committee, a larger amount if they, in fact, slept here at the White House in the Lincoln Bedroom. ?That is the key distinction, the Republicans say: that there is no targeting necessarily of these people to come to the vice president's residence. ??They also point out that the original letters inviting these big donors to Washington did not in any way suggest there would be a reception at the vice president's residence: the point there being these people donated without any expectation of having dinner or reception with Lynne Cheney and Dick Cheney in the vice president's home. ??WOODRUFF: And Major, just to clarify, the 400 people invited tonight to the vice president's, how many are they saying did not give money? ??GARRETT: They're not disclosing any numbers. ?They're only saying that some have given. ?They clearly and readily acknowledge that. ?Some are lobbyists. Some represent large corporations. ?But others, they say, are just Republican National Committee officials. And others of an undisclosed nature -- not fund-raisers, not Republican Party officials -- who will be there tonight. Don't have any numbers for you on that, though. ??WOODRUFF: All right, Major Garrett reporting at the White House. Thank you very much. ??Vice President Cheney maybe taking some heat for fund-raising tactics, not to mention his role in creating the Bush energy plan. Look that this: ??Our new poll shows Cheney's job approval rating is 4 points higher than the presidents. ?While Mr. Bush's approval rating has held pretty steady in the past couple of weeks, he has lost ground since late April. ?Cheney's approval rating has dipped as well. ??For more on Mr. Bush's ratings and how they relate to his policies, we are joined now by our senior political analyst Bill Schneider. ??Tell us, Bill, which of Mr. Bush's policies is the most popular? ??WILLIAM SCHNEIDER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, you might guess energy, given the high ratings for Dick Cheney that you just reported -- but you would be wrong. ??Because, what Americans like best is the tax cut. ?Two thirds of the public now favors a substantial tax cut. ?That's up from 60 percent earlier this month. Well, why not? ?What's wrong with getting some money back from the government? ??Actually, most people do not think the tax cut could benefit them much financially. ?They like it because they believe it will help the economy. ?And that is why so many Democrats find it very difficult to oppose. ??WOODRUFF: What about the energy plan? ??SCHNEIDER: Not such a success. ?Not like the tax cut. ?Americans are actually divided over the president's energy plan. ?Why? ?It's not because the public blames the Bush administration for the nation's energy problems. ?Most people blame the oil companies. ??In fact, more people blame Congress and the Clinton administration and environmental laws and American consumers than blame the Bush administration. But most Americans still give President Bush low marks on energy. ?The core criticism of his energy plan is: it doesn't do enough. ?55 percent of Americans say President Bush is not doing enough to solve the country's energy problems. ??What doesn't the plan do? ?It doesn't do much right now. ?Only 8 percent of Americans believe the plan will help the nation's energy problem immediately. Most people think oh, it will help, but only after several years. ?It's a long-run solution. ?Americans want help now. ?Right now. ?With electricity in California. ?And with gas prices all over the country. ?Long-term solutions are important, but politics is a short-term business. ?If the problem is now, people want results now. ??And they don't see what the Bush energy plan is going to do about $2-a-gallon gasoline now. ??WOODRUFF: Why do people think the energy plan fails to do that? ??SCHNEIDER: Because they think this administration is run by oilmen. ?Oilmen like $2-a-gallon gasoline. ?Maybe even 3. ??By nearly two to one, the public believes energy companies have too much influence over the Bush administration's policies. ?In fact, Americans are split when you ask them whether the Bush energy plan is designed to further the country's interests or the energy companies' interests. ?That sounds like breathtaking cynicism. ?But any administration that's run by Texas oilmen is automatically suspect. ??WOODRUFF: All right, Bill Schneider, thank you very much. You're not suspect. ??SCHNEIDER: I am certainly not. ??WOODRUFF: At least as far as we know. ??Do Californians blame President Bush for their energy crisis? We've heard a little bit from Bill on that. ?That answer and more on the issue later this hour. ?Plus: ??Just what kind of tax cut is the Senate considering? ?Jonathan Karl crunches the numbers. ?Also: ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have no ability to bring up the amendments. ?You don't set the agenda every day, and that is real power in the House. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??WOODRUFF: The trials and tribulations of the minority leader, as he considers the present and the future. ?And later: ??Rewarding a president's most controversial decision. ?A political ""Profile In Courage."" All ahead on INSIDE POLITICS. ??(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ??WOODRUFF: President Bush today donned the traditional commencement robes, and gave the graduating class at Yale University a few bits of advice. ?The president also included a glimpse at his less-than-perfect college years. ?As CNN's Kelly Wallace reports, today's speech was a departure from how the President's dealt with his alma mater in the past. ??(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ??KELLY WALLACE, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A homecoming of sorts, George W. Bush who has only been back to his alma mater once since graduating in 1968, returns to address those at the top and the bottom of Yale's graduating class. ??BUSH: And to the C students... ??(LAUGHTER) ??I say, you too, can be president of the United States. ??(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) ??WALLACE: The president offering a self-deprecating account of his days as the undergraduate, when, as a history major, he earned modest grades and was known more as a fraternity boy prankster than a rising political star. ??The visit was not without controversy, with some students protesting and some professors boycotting, charging that Mr. Bush was not yet deserving of an honorary degree. ??PETER BROOKS, YALE UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR: It doesn't seem at present to represent the intellectual ideals and the service to humanity in which we think that Yale stands for. ??WALLACE: The president has kept his distance from this Ivy League institution for most of his political life, painting it as a symbol of elitism, even during his days at Yale. TERRY JOHNSON, BUSH'S YALE ROOMMATE: What George -- does not respond well to are people who are snobs, whether you are a social snob or an intellectual snob or any other kind of snob. ??WALLACE: Mr. Bush rarely mentions what he did on this day, that he was born in New Haven when his dad, the former president, was an undergraduate at Yale. ??BUSH: My life began just a few blocks from here, but I was raised in West Texas. ?From there, Yale always seemed a world away. ??WALLACE: The president, for years, had been miffed with Yale for not awarding an honorary degree to his dad until 1991, the third year of his presidency. ?But it appears now, all is forgiven. ??BUSH: In my time they spoke of the Yale man, I was really never sure of what that was. ?But I do think that I am a better man because of Yale. ??WALLACE: Mr. Bush, the son and grandson of Yalies and now father of a current student, seems very proud that Yale is a part of his past. ??Kelly Wallace, CNN, New Haven, Connecticut. ??(END VIDEOTAPE) ??WOODRUFF: And looking now ahead to 2004: the Reverend Al Sharpton says that he will explore seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. ?The civil rights activist said yesterday that the party did not protect the rights of disenfranchised voters in Florida in the last presidential race. ??If he runs, Sharpton said that he would promote issues that concern blacks and progressives, and his effort would not be just symbolic. ?Sharpton ran unsuccessfully for the Senate in New York in 1994 and for mayor of New York City in 1997. ??Reverend Sharpton and former Republican presidential candidate Gary Bauer will discuss President Bush's faith-based plan to help the poor tonight on ""CROSSFIRE."" That's at 7:30 p.m. Eastern. ??Another note from New York: a state supreme court justice today barred Rudy Giuliani's girlfriend from the mayor's official residence, Gracie Mansion. ?The judge ruled in favor of Giuliani's estranged wife, Donna Hanover, who had requested a restraining order barring Judith Nathan from the residence. ?The ruling says that Nathan may not enter the residence as long as the Giuliani children continue to live there. ?The judge also denied Giuliani's second attempt for a gag order in the couple's divorce proceedings. ??And we'll have the latest on President Bush's tax cut when we come back. ??(COMMERCIAL BREAK) WOODRUFF: This evening, the Senate is expected to vote on the latest version of the now $1.35 trillion tax cut plan. ?Republican leaders hope to give President Bush the tax cut for approval before Memorial Day. ?But as Jonathan Karl reports, taxpayers will have a longer wait before reaping any of the measure's benefits. ??(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ??JONATHAN KARL, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Senate's $1.35 trillion tax cut would be the biggest in a generation, but don't spend your tax windfall yet. ?Most of the cuts will not take effect for several years to come. ??Relief from the so-called major penalty will not start until the year 2005. The estate tax won't be repealed until 2011. ?That means even if President Bush is re-elected, it wouldn't take effect until two years after he completed his second term. ?The IRA contribution limit would be raised from $2,000 to $5,000, but that also wouldn't happen until the year 2011. ??The tax cut calls for doubling of the child tax credit, but that takes 10 years too. ?The credit would rise from $500 to $600 this year, slowly increasing in $100 increments over the next 10 years until it finally reaches $1,000 in the year 2011. ?The cuts in income tax rates would be phased in even more slowly. ??SEN. CHARLES GRASSLEY (R-IA), FINANCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: You are right, some of them do not -- are phased in over a period of time. But there is real relief in this tax bill for every taxpayer starting January 1, 2001. ?They don't have to wait until next year. ??KARL: That immediate tax relief amounts to $300 for individuals and $600 for couples filing jointly, but just how that money gets back to taxpayers is still to be worked out. ?The option favored by the president is a simple rebate check sent directly to taxpayers, an idea opposed by many Senate Republicans who call it impractical. ??But the rebate would represent a fraction of the overall tax cut, which Democratic opponents say will explode in cost after it's fully phased in two years from now. ??SEN. KENT CONRAD (D), NORTH DAKOTA: This plan is fully back- loaded. ?That means simply that it is disguised in terms of its full cost. ?This decade it cost $1.35 trillion. ?In the next decade, it will cost from 3.5 to $4 trillion. ??KARL: But there's a little noticed provision of this tax cut that may make that point moot. ?The tax cut includes a sunset provision, that means all the tax cuts in the bill would expire in the year 2012. ?For the tax cuts to remain in place, Congress would have to pass them again. ??(END VIDEOTAPE) ??KARL: Now, the Senate is expected to vote on a series of amendments to the tax cut later on today, paving the way for a final vote on the tax cut here in the Senate tonight. ?But it will not end there. ?This still needs to be reconciled with the tax cut that was passed in House, the House passing almost exactly the president's tax cut, including much deeper cuts in income tax rates preferred by Republicans. ??The Senate and the House will have to work out their differences. They're expected to do so this week, setting the stage to send this final tax cut down Pennsylvania Avenue and onto the president's desk by Memorial Day -- Judy. ??WOODRUFF: Jon, when you talk about the plan providing 300 or $300 a year per individual, divided by 12, that's $20-some a month. Is this the kind of money the president was talking about when he said the tax cut would help people with higher gasoline prices? ??KARL: This was exactly what he had it mind. ?This was exactly what he was talking about, directing the money right into the hands of taxpayers, directly into the hands of those people paying higher gasoline prices at the pumps. ??This is an idea that his Treasury secretary, Paul O'Neill, strongly favors, the idea of direct cash payments or check payments to taxpayers. ?But one big problem with this, Judy, is that taxpayers over the course of time move, they change addresses, some of them die. The question is, how do you make sure you get all the right checks to those people at current addresses? ?It's not an easy proposition. ??WOODRUFF: And Jon, one other subject, we know the president's nominee to be solicitor general of the United States has run into a real problem in the Senate committee. ?Where does that stand right now? ?The last we heard, the Senate Judiciary had split 9-9 on the nomination of Ted Olson. ??KARL: Well, the Senate leaders, Trent Lott and Tom Daschle, are now actively involved in this, trying to come to some kind of an agreement, an agreement that will allow the Democrats to get access to some information they want about Olson, especially information that was compiled by independent council Robert Ray, looking to just what Olson's involvement was in that Arkansas Project by the ""American Spectator"" magazine, the investigation into Bill Clinton's personal life. ??They want information from the independent council to look at just how involved Olson was in that project, to see whether or not he was truthful in his testimony when he said he was not very involved at all. ?There's some movement to try to get the Democrats on the committee more of the information, also maybe to release more of it to the public. ??If that's all done, it would set the stage for a vote on the Olson nomination before the full Senate, but probably not until after Memorial Day. ?The Senate goes on recess at the end of the week, they will be off all of next week, you probably won't see a vote on the Olson nomination until after they return. ??WOODRUFF: All right, Jon Karl at the Capitol, thanks. In the House of Representatives, Democrats are finding themselves drowned out by the Republican majority. ?Add to that, critics who say the party is lacking leadership and strategy. ?And life in the House minority begins to look bleak. ?Our Kate Snow caught up with the House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt to talk about the balance of power and his political future. ??(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ??REP. DICK GEPHARDT (D-MO), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: We need to say what are we for, and that's what... ??KATE SNOW, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Dick Gephardt will tell you it's frustrating being a Democrat these days, stuck in the minority without the backing of the White House. ??GEPHARDT: Well, you take what you -- what you are given. ?I mean, the people run this country. ?We don't. ?And so, you fight for what you believe in as hard as you can, and if you really believe in it, then you're frustrated if you're not able to those policies through. ??SNOW: Gephardt says the Democrats are forced to play defense, responding to Republicans. ??GEPHARDT: I think we slowed down a little bit the amount of the tax bill -- not enough, in my view -- but we lowered it some so that the potential deficits out there in the future won't be so large. ?I think we cooperated with the president on the educational bill, at least the substance of it, but we still haven't been able to convince him or the Republicans to put enough money into education to really make the program happen. ??On energy, I think that we've got a very, very positive alternative that I hope people will listen to. ?People in California and Oregon and Washington need help now. ??SNOW: That was last week's theme. ?First at a gas station, the lawn of the Capitol the next day, and then in a underground war room. ??Gephardt is a master at staying on message, often spending hours talking to the press, his strategy: agree with Republicans when he thinks they're right and hammer at home when he disagrees. ??GEPHARDT: If we do not learn from history, we are forced to repeat it. ?This is a mistake that we will pay for for years to come. ??I try not to yell. ?I try to get ideas across as good a way as I can. ?But there are times when you need to show your emotion. ?You need to let people know that you really care about this. ?And you really want the country to go in a different direction. ?And I think you can't appear too tentative or too laid back or too uninterested. ??SNOW: But is the strategy working? ??I have talked to some Democrats who say that they are truly unhappy. Some of whom say that they are unhappy with your leadership. ?They don't feel that you're doing an effective job. ?Do you feel that there is trouble within the ranks? ??GEPHARDT: I don't. ?I think that -- I think the ranks and the Democratic Party are largely unified. ?They are marching together and working together in ways that I've never seen them before. ?I always tell them that it's me and we. And we have to be a team. ??I would never tell you that anybody is ever going to be pleased every day with everything that happens, but largely, I think that we've achieved real unity and real effectiveness in being the loyal opposition here in Washington. ??SNOW: How much of your days are spent thinking about 2002 in the next election? ??GEPHARDT: Well, I want to win the majority back. ?I think it's really important, not for the party and not for me, but for the country. ??SNOW: Is it more important to win back the majority than it is to win legislatively for the next couple of years? ??GEPHARDT: I think it is in the House for sure, because the minority is really out of power totally in the House. ?You have no ability to bring up amendments, you don't set the agenda every day. And that is real power in the House. ??SNOW: There is a lot of focus on 2004, a lot of talk about your ambitions, do you have plans to run for president? ??GEPHARDT: I really think that if you don't stay totally focused on the goal that is ahead of you, then you lessen your chances of reaching that goal. ?And my goal is to win back the majority in the Congress in 2002. ?I think, as usual in our system, we all want to look ahead and start calling the next race after that for president, but that is not what I'm doing and not what I should be doing. ??SNOW (voice-over): Gephardt insists he's not planning ahead, though he's scheduled to attend four events in New Hampshire in two weeks. ??GEPHARDT: The future will take of itself. ?I have no idea what will happen, and I'm not worried about it, and I don't spend time worrying about it. Because, again, I've got to do this in 2002. ?This is what we're trying to do. ??SNOW: So, are you committed to staying minority leader through 2002? ??GEPHARDT: Absolutely. ?I'm totally committed to winning this House back, and I think we are going to do it. ??SNOW: Speaker of the House, you said to me last fall that that had a nice ring to it? GEPHARDT: It works for me. ??(END VIDEOTAPE) ??WOODRUFF: Kate Snow talking with House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt. ?They talked today. ?And later this week, Kate will sit down with House Speaker Dennis Hastert. ?You can look for that report on Friday. ??On another term for the another high-profile Republican and two nationally known Democrats with apparent home state ambitions. ??INSIDE POLITICS will be right back. ??(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ??To no one's surprise, Charlton Heston was reelected today to an unprecedented fourth term as president of the National Rifle Association. ?The 77-year-old actor was chosen at the NRA's annual convention in Kansas City. ?The group changed its rules last year to allow Heston a third term, and a spokesman said there really wasn't much discussion by the board before deciding to elect him, once again. ??Former Attorney General Janet Reno may be looking for a new line of work.

Yet President Bush has offered no relief to hard-pressed rate payers. ?His spokesman saying, ""The president continues to believe that the issue is mostly a California matter"" and our representative, Stephen Horn, has joined with Bush in opposing a temporary cap on electricity prices. ?Call Congressman Horn and tell him we need action now. ??That is if you can find the phone. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??WOODRUFF: The Democratic committee said that it has bought significant air time for that spot, part of a month-long radio and TV ad campaign targeting Republicans on energy. ?Let's talk more now about energy politics with the director of that Public Policy Institute of California poll we just told you about, Mark Baldassare joins us now from San Francisco. ??Mark, first of all, this poll finds Californians pessimistic in general, did that surprise you? ??MARK BALDASSARE, CALIFORNIA POLLSTER: It did. ?For the past three years, we've been in an incredible time of optimism in California. ?Two-thirds of Californians have said that the state is going in the right direction. ?Most Californians felt that economic times would continue to be good, and most Californians also were highly approving of the governor and the legislature. For the first time, we've seen a dramatic drop in optimism about the state, about the economy and ratings of the governor. ??WOODRUFF: And why do you think that is? ??BALDASSARE: Well, eight in ten Californians say they have been closely following the electricity situation in the state and most Californians are telling us in our survey that they consider it the top issue and 80 percent of Californians say it's a big problem and moreover, a problem that is going to effect the economy. ?So there's been a great deal of uncertainty that's been created by the electricity situation and because of that uncertainty, people are beginning to feel very nervous about our state. ??WOODRUFF: So you're saying because of the electricity crisis, if you want to call it that in California, it's now driving people's views of everything: population, the economy, across-the-board. ??BALDASSARE: We -- for the past few years people have been focused on improving the schools, for instance. ?Now only 6 percent in our most recent survey said that's the issue that concerns them most in the state. ?And we see that there is growing pessimism at the same time that there is growing concern that this electricity situation is not under control and could affect the state's economy. ??WOODRUFF: Explain for us, Mark, who people are blaming. ?We were -- Bill Schneider reported earlier on the program that Americans, overall, are having mixed views about to what extent President Bush is responsible. ?Here we're learning in California, they hold President Bush far less responsible than they do local leaders. ??BALDASSARE: Yeah, well, we are at time right now in California where people haven't experienced the rate hikes yet. ?They've certainly heard about them. They haven't experienced, for the most part, frequent rolling blackouts, but they hear that they're coming. And so when we talk about blame, people are focused on what happened five years ago to put us into this situation. ?And for that, of course, they don't blame either the current governor or the current president. ?Now, as we go forward over the next few months, people are going to be re-assigning blame as well as re-evaluating the solutions that are in place, and that's why I think both the Democrats and Republicans are very urgently trying to get their message out right now about who they think is to blame and who they think has the best solutions. ??WOODRUFF: Well, Mark, what is your reading on this? ?Are ads, like the ones we just saw the Democrats running out there, are those likely to have an effect on people's views? ??BALDASSARE: I don't think so. ?I think that what is will most going to have a effect on people's views over these next few months is how the crisis is actually resolved. ?And if people feel that these electricity hikes have really, you know, altered their lifestyle or they're going to impact the economy, if they feel blackouts are really going to, you know, put them in an uncomfortable situation going through the summer, then my guess is they are going to give blame both to Bush and to Davis. ??WOODRUFF: All right, Mark Baldassare of the California Public Policy Institute. ?Thanks very much, good to see you again. ??BALDASSARE: Thank you. ?Same here. ??WOODRUFF: As California tries to ease its energy problems, there are concerns about the cost not only for consumers, but for the environment. ?CNN's Rusty Dornin takes a closer look at the issues being raised by one California plant's effort to expand. ??(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ??RUSTY DORNIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): An aging giant known as the Mighty Moss. ?The 50-year-old Moss Landing Natural Gas plant along California's coast owned by Duke Energy. ?A face lift and an expansion will soon make this the largest power generator in the state, providing 2.3 million homes with light, heat and air conditioning. ?But all that power takes water to cool the turbines, water that's home to otters, fish, herons and other wildlife. ??CAROLYN NIELSEN, PLANT OPPONENT: Every day, Duke will use 333 football-size fields -- pools of water that are 10 feet deep. ?That is just incomprehensible. ??DORNIN: Water from the wetlands run through the plant, returning to the ocean 30 degrees warmer. ?Been that way for 50 years. ?Now environmentalists worry that increasing the intake will sterilize any creature sucked in. ??PATRICIA MATEJCEK, SIERRA CLUB: Everything that lives in that volume of water: eggs from fish from clams, diatoms, young fish, everything in it will be killed. ??DORNIN: Environmentalists say the Mighty Moss got a break on the approval process, as regulators here faced the state's energy crisis. It took 14 months. Permitting for smaller plants in the state is down to 21 days. ??KAITILIN GAFFNEY, CENTER FOR MARINE CONSERVATION: It's so fast that my concern is that we wouldn't even catch really obvious problems because we are just are not taking a hard look at these plants at all. ??DORNIN: But here's the twist as part of the permit process: local environmental groups signed off on the Mighty Moss renovation plan. ??GAFFNEY: So at the eleventh hour, we were able to work out this deal with Duke to at least ensure that the scientific monitoring will go on. ??DORNIN (on camera): Duke Energy will spend more than $8 million expanding the wetlands and in donations to local environmental groups. There will also be an independent monitor who will assess any damage to the environment. ??TOM WILLIAMS, DUKE ENERGY: This will more than compensate any potential effects that the new power plant will have on the habitat. This state is in an energy crisis. ?The new plant we're bringing on is cleaner, more efficient than virtually any plant in the country today. ??DORNIN: Environmentalists made a deal here, but many fear, in a power-hungry state, taking what they can get may be their only option. ??Rusty Dornin, CNN, Moss Landing, California. ??(END VIDEOTAPE) ??WOODRUFF: A very different kind of power politics, circa the 1970s, is being seen in a whole new light in some circles. ?Former President Ford is honored for granting a famous -- some would say infamous -- at pardon. ??That's next on INSIDE POLITICS. ??(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ??WOODRUFF: It is something that many Americans that lived through the Watergate era might never dream they would see. ?An award named for a Democratic icon presented to the man who angered many Democrats by pardoning Richard Nixon. ??CNN's Bruce Morton has an inside view of this twist on political history. ??(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ??CAROLINE KENNEDY SCHLOSSBERG, JOHN KENNEDY'S DAUGHTER: He placed his love of country ahead of his own political future. ?We are honored to present you, President Ford, with the John F. Kennedy Profile In Courage Award for 2001. ??(APPLAUSE) ??BRUCE MORTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Gerald Ford, now 87, got the award because, as a new unelected president, he pardoned his predecessor, Richard Nixon, who had resigned in disgrace to avoid impeachment over the Watergate scandal. ??RICHARD M. NIXON, 37TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow. ??MORTON: ""Our long national nightmare is over,"" the new man said of Watergate. But really, what would end it? ?Nixon could still face charges. ??GERALD FORD, 38TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: My conscience tells me that only I, as president, have the constitutional power to firmly shut and seal this book. ??MORTON: And so he granted: ??FORD: A full, free and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon. ??MORTON: Many Americans thought that was a mistake. ??SEN. TED KENNEDY (D), MASSACHUSETTS: I was one of those who spoke out against his actions then, but time has a way of clarifying past events. ?And now we see that President Ford was right. ??MORTON: Not everyone agrees. ?Ford's press secretary at the time, Gerald Ter Horst, resigned to protest the Nixon pardon and still thinks it was wrong. ??JERRY TER HORST, FORMER FORD PRESS SECRETARY: He was going to go off scot-free, whereas all of his minions -- the people who worked at the White House, from the chief of staff on down to Ehrlichman, Chuck Colson and others -- they were going to have to do prison time; they were not going to get pardons. MORTON: And it may have cost Ford the 1976 election. ?It was a close election. Many things could have swung it, but the pardon was surely one. ?Jimmy Carter, who beat Ford, thanked him Inauguration Day. ??JAMES EARL CARTER, 39TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: For myself and for our nation, I want to thank my predecessor for all he has done to heal our land. ??MORTON: Accepting the award, Ford talked about the need for courage today in a politics dominated by ""partisan jockeying at the expense of public policy."" ??FORD: I sense a longing for community, a desire on the part of Americans to be part of something bigger, finer than themselves. ??MORTON: Historians may still argue about the pardon. ?They agree he cared about his country and its politics, and did what he thought was right. ??Bruce Morton, CNN, Washington. ??(END VIDEOTAPE) ??WOODRUFF: Also cited for political courage today, Democratic Congressman John Lewis of Georgia who was beaten, as he and others challenged segregation during the freedom rides through the South in 1961. ??Lewis was given a special Profile of Courage Award for Lifetime Achievement. ??Former president Ford, Congressman Lewis and Caroline Kennedy will all be guests tonight on ""WOLF BLITZER REPORTS.""

Subject:: Burlington: PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY-CLIENT
 COMMUNICATION
Body:: Lorraine, here are a few notes from my review of the Val Verde contract, and my initial impressions. Let's talk more about how to approach the issue after we meet with Ron tomorrow about MAOP. 12/31/92 Interconnect Agreement: Sec. 1.3 specifies pressures and states that unless there is an agreement to provide firm compression service TW will accept up to 200,000 on an interruptible basis. Sec. 2 states that the Blanco Hub MAOP shall not be exceeded. Sec. 4.2 limits damages (no consequential damages). The contract also has a fairly standard force majeure clause. 2/18/93 letter amendment: Sec. 3 obligates TW to provide firm compression service in order to accept 200,000 into TW's system (provided MOGI has pressure of at least 650 and quantity of at least 140). Acknowledges that this is an agreement to provide firm compression in accordance with Sec. 1.3 of 12/92 agreement. 9/25/95 letter amendment: Increases quantity to be received at the interconnect to 250,000 once the San Juan expansion is effective. My initial conclusions: It is pretty clear we have an obligation to accept 250,000 on a firm basis, provided that Burlington complies with the pressure requirements. Probably the only way we can avoid this obligation is if accepting 250,000 would cause us to exceed the hub MAOP. In that case we can argue impossibility of performance. Also, we could avoid the obligation because the summer heat above certain temperatures constitutes force majeure. This argument is strengthened by the fact that temperatures seem to have gotten hotter over the years. The fact that we entered into our most recent agreement with Burlington in January of this year weakens the credibility of our arguments (they will say we should have known by now). Burlington might try to argue that we have an absolute obligation to comply with the agreement, even if it means expensive system modifications. That argument is not a very strong one because the agreement contains no such affirmative obligation and in fact quite clearly describes the facilities that are the subject of the agreement.

From March 2000 to February 2001, natural gas prices have risen 489 percent compared to a 266 percent increase in New Mexico and a 247 percent jump in Chicago. ??Steinberg asked Ralph Eads, the president of an El Paso Natural Gas Co. subsidiary, for an explanation. ??""The 275 percent difference you say is attributable completely to constraints on the pipeline and demand?"" Steinberg asked. ??""Yes,"" Eads replied. Eads said the state's energy crisis, which led power plants to run harder and longer, dramatically increased demand for natural gas over the summer and a winter with temperatures about 15 percent cooler than the year before exacerbated the problem. ??In another twist to California's deregulation nightmare, El Paso officials said they gained greater control of the pipeline after the Pacific Gas & Electric Co. relinquished the capacity four years ago. At that time, PG&E's movement of the gas and the prices it could charge were regulated by the Public Utilities Commission. ??In other developments at the Capitol on Thursday, lawmakers called on the federal government to re- regulate natural gas sales at the California border and U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., said federal regulators should impose price caps on California's wholesale electricity market. ??The Assembly held considerable debate on the resolution asking for re-regulation, with Democrats accusing President George W. Bush of doing nothing to come to the aid of California and Republicans defending the administration. ??""I'm learning an interesting lesson that all the problems of the world started after Jan. 21 and the inauguration of the new president,"" said Assemblyman Bill Leonard, R-San Bernardino. ??KRT CALIFORNIA is a premium service of Knight Ridder/Tribune ??(c) 2001, Contra Costa Times (Walnut Creek, Calif.). ??Visit the Contra Costa Times on the Web at http://www.cctimes.com/ JOURNAL-CODE: CC LOAD-DATE: April 20, 2001 of 78 DOCUMENTS 2001 / Los Angeles Times Angeles Times ?????????????????????April 20, 2001, Friday, Home Edition SECTION: Part A; Part 1; Page 3; Metro Desk LENGTH: 715 words HEADLINE: CALIFORNIA AND THE WEST; A U-TURN ON CAR TAX REBATES; LEGISLATION: STARTING JULY 1, FEE REDUCTION WILL BE FIGURED DIRECTLY INTO VEHICLE REGISTRATION BILLS, NOT REFUNDED BY MAIL. BYLINE: CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Gov. Gray Davis and the Legislature spun a U-turn Thursday and scrapped a costly program that requires motorists to first pay their car tax and then get a rebate in the mail. ??Starting July 1, the state Department of Motor Vehicles will send owners of approximately 26 million vehicles registration renewal bills already reduced by the amount of the vehicle license fee rebates. ??On a unanimous roll call, the Senate voted final approval and sent to Davis an ""urgency"" bill, SB 52, that repealed the rebate program, which the governor had previously fought for and defended. ??In addition to abolishing the rebates, the legislation reduces by 67.5% the amount motorists must pay for the upcoming year, the level that lawmakers and former Gov. Pete Wilson envisioned in 1998 when they began cutting the fee. It had been about 2% of a vehicle's market value. ??Davis immediately signed the repeal bill, saying only that the new law will ""expedite relief to taxpayers and greatly reduce administrative costs."" ??The governor's muted observation contrasted with his effusive support of the rebates last year, when he said Californians ""don't appreciate the fact that they're getting a rebate unless they see it in their hands."" ??At the time, Davis and the Legislature had the choice of simply cutting the car tax, which voters might not notice, or sending checks in the mail, which Davis felt would have a greater impact. ??The rebates, which began Jan. 1, were scheduled to continue through 2002, when Davis intends to run for reelection. In 2003, the license fee was to have fallen permanently, with no more rebates. ??""The whole rebate scheme was good only through the next gubernatorial election cycle,"" said Sen. Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks), who supported reductions in the license fee but opposed the rebates. ??Until July 1, the DMV will continue to bill motorists for the full amount of their license fee, which includes a 35% reduction from last year. ??""Then we return to you an additional 32.5% rebate, making a total reduction of 67.5%,"" said DMV spokesman Bill Branch. Starting with license renewals on July 1, the DMV bills will include the full tax cut. ??A Senate analysis of the repeal bill noted that the current ""awkward system . . . effectively requires taxpayers to overpay their vehicle license fee and then await a rebate check from the state--a system that is, at best, difficult to explain."" ??But as the California economy tightened, the state's budget surplus shrank and taxpayers shelled out approximately $ 50 million a day to buy electricity, the costs of the rebate program threatened to become a political embarrassment to Davis. ??Projected administrative and postage costs of the rebate program alone were estimated at $ 22 million this year and another $ 22 million or so next year. ??Last year, state Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) and McClintock sought to eliminate the rebates and give drivers their full tax cuts when they register their vehicles. Under pressure from Davis, the bill failed. ??""It was killed behind the scenes at the insistence of the governor,"" McClintock said Thursday. ""He didn't want it on his desk."" ??This year, Dunn launched a similar bill, but his name was struck from it as the lead author in the Assembly and the name of Sen. Wes Chesbro (D-Arcata) was substituted. ??In a speech Thursday, Sen. Ross Johnson (R-Irvine) suggested that Davis' performance on the issue in an ""earlier time and a more just society"" would have resulted in his ""public flogging by representatives of taxpayers."" ??The repeal bill was passed 78 to 0 by the Assembly on Monday, and sent to Davis by the Senate on a 34-0 vote Thursday. ??If the rebates were to be abolished, the bill had to pass this week in order to take effect July 1, said Branch, the DMV spokesman. This is because motorists must be advised 60 days in advance that their registration renewals are due. ??""We have to reprogram all the computers. We have to print new bills and mail them by May 1 for the July 1 expiration,"" he said. ""It will be a little tight, but we will still make it."" ??Branch said that since the Jan. 1 start of rebates, checks totaling $ 454 million have been sent to 7.4 million vehicle owners at an extra administrative cost of $ 9.4 million.

LOPEZ and RICH CONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS BODY: ??California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer, ratcheting up his investigation of possible civil and criminal violations by the state's power suppliers, is asking a San Francisco judge to order two firms to hand over confidential records. ??In a motion filed Thursday in Superior Court, Lockyer said Reliant Energy and Mirant Corp. have failed to comply with subpoenas for documents that were to be produced by March 19. ??Amid soaring electricity costs and rolling blackouts, the attorney general launched an investigation of possible manipulation of wholesale electricity prices that have skyrocketed to record levels and have financially crippled the state's major utilities. ??Dozens of other public and private power suppliers are complying with the subpoenas. ??But in an interview, Lockyer accused Reliant and Mirant of stonewalling investigators ""so they can keep enjoying these exorbitant profits and prices for as long as possible."" ??Ultimately, the companies will have to honor the subpoenas, he said. ""I'm going to pit bull them,"" he said. ""This is one we win."" ??Both companies say they have done nothing wrong and played by the rules of California's flawed electricity deregulation plan. ??A spokesman for Houston-based Reliant said Thursday the firm is seeking court action of its own to ensure that sensitive business information will not be shared with other public agencies or its competitors. ??Last week, Reliant asked a Los Angeles Superior Court judge to clarify the attorney general's obligation to keep proprietary information confidential. ??""We're glad to cooperate with his investigation to the extent we can,"" said Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley. "" But we have not received sufficient assurances that Lockyer would keep the data confidential."" ??Lockyer called Reliant's court filing ""frivolous"" and ""propagandistic"" and insisted that adequate safeguards are in place. He reserves the right under state law to share information with other government agencies aiding in his investigation but has said he will keep sensitive business information from being made public. ??Atlanta-based Mirant demanded and received similar guarantees of confidentiality, Lockyer said. Mirant did not return phones calls Thursday. ??Lockyer did not discuss details of the probe or the kinds of information he's seeking. But based on the investigation so far, he said, ""it's beginning to get interesting."" ??Other records indicate that the attorney general has sought 91 categories of information about the power merchants' activities. They include the operation of power plants, trading information that may have been shared by private power suppliers and bidding strategies in the California market.

S. MUST STEP IN TO PROTECT STATE FROM MANIPULATION BY SUPPLIERS. BYLINE: MITCHELL LANDSBERG and MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS BODY: ??This may be the surest sign yet of the depth of California's energy crisis: A bipartisan cross-section of the state's congressional delegation, brought together Thursday by Gov. Gray Davis, not only agreed about the severity of the problem but also about the need for swift federal intervention. ??""This meeting did not have the word 'Democrat' or 'Republican' used once,"" Rep. Darrell E. Issa (R-Vista), said of the unusual spirit of cooperation at the meeting near Los Angeles International airport. ??Members of both parties said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must slash wholesale electricity prices so California utilities can once again afford to buy power. Since January, the state government has been buying electricity on their behalf, as skyrocketing wholesale prices put Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison billions of dollars into debt and many power suppliers refused to sell to them; PG&E has since filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. ??Although the Bush administration has said repeatedly that it is strongly opposed to price caps, and FERC has refused to grant them, California Republicans at the energy meeting said they are optimistic that the administration will agree to some other form of price regulation. They brushed aside the notion that such regulations might conflict with their ideological belief in a free market. ??""This is not a free-enterprise situation,"" Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Alpine) said after the meeting. ""In fact, it's just the opposite."" ??Specifically citing the huge disparity between natural gas prices charged to California and those charged in other Western states, he said California clearly has been the victim of unreasonably high energy costs. Under federal law, the FERC must regulate the prices of companies if it finds they are exerting ""market power"" to drive prices to unreasonable levels. ??Executives from two Texas energy companies, meeting with legislators in Sacramento, denied Thursday that they had caused natural gas prices in California to artificially skyrocket by hoarding access to a critical pipeline into the state. ??After the extraordinary meeting in Los Los Angeles, Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) said the biggest disagreement between California Democrats and Republicans appeared to be their relative faith--or lack thereof--in the ability of President Bush and his administration to help California. There has been much speculation that Bush, who lost California in November, has no political motive to help the state. ??""We Democrats,"" said Sherman, ""hope very much that our skepticism is proven wrong."" ??Davis--who sat flanked by Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and the governor's newly appointed chief energy advisor, S. David Freeman--said he used the meeting mainly to discuss the importance of conservation by Californians this summer and to ask the congressional delegation to pitch in. Five Republicans and more than a dozen Democrats attended the gathering. ??Feinstein said Thursday that she has asked for a third time to meet with Bush to discuss the energy situation. Meeting with Times reporters and editors Wednesday, she described a recent meeting with Vice President Dick Cheney in which, she said, he ""ignored"" her appeal for federal assistance. ??Feinstein has been among those critical of natural gas companies, saying they appear to have constricted access to a California-bound pipeline to run up prices. ??The Brattle Group, a respected consulting firm, alleged Wednesday before an Assembly committee that Dynegy Inc. and El Paso Natural Gas Co. had manipulated the market by charging so much for the rights to their pipeline capacity that they had, in effect, withheld access to it. ??That action, the experts said, directly forced companies trying to deliver gas to California to look for alternatives, clogging other pipelines and causing a surge in prices. ??The explanation, El Paso executives said, was simple: Demand for gas soared in California because generators that use gas to make electricity increased production last year in response to the energy crisis. ??""We're not withholding capacity--no one is,"" said El Paso Merchant Energy President Ralph Eads. ""With these prices, you want to sell every molecule."" ??In other developments Thursday: ??* The agreement between Davis and Edison International to return its ailing utility arm to financial health is in ""deep trouble and could be rejected by legislators,"" the Standard & Poor's credit rating agency said in a note to clients, citing legislative and other sources. A rejection of the deal ""would be a humiliating setback for the governor,"" S&P said. ??The agreement calls for, among other things, the sale of Edison's transmission grid to the state for $ 2.76 billion and the sale of $ 2 billion in bonds--both designed to pay off the utility's huge electricity debt. Edison agreed to several constraints, including the sale of electricity to the state at prices tied to the cost of producing power. ??Since they returned Monday from a two-week recess, state legislators have been sharply critical of the Edison agreement and have indicated a desire to tinker with aspects of the deal. Some lawmakers have said publicly that a bankruptcy protection filing by Edison, like that of PG&E, might not be such a dire outcome. ??But a senior Edison executive said it is ""way too early"" to give up on passage of the proposal, which legislators have not yet seen in official form. ??""There is an education process to do here,"" the executive said of the highly detailed 38-page document. ""The legislators should be asking questions. That is appropriate."" ??* The Public Utilities Commission voted to investigate whether alternative energy providers violated contractual agreements by withholding supplies from PG&E and Edison, which owe them hundreds of millions of dollars. ??The action, Commissioner Carl W. Wood said, was prompted in part by lawsuits some providers have filed seeking release from their contracts with the cash-starved utilities. The producers of solar, wind and geothermal energy account for more than 25% of California's electricity supply. ??""The question is whether we will be able to rely on them in the long, hot days of summer,"" Wood said. ??Jack Raudy of the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee said the PUC needs to address the $ 700 million the producers are owed. ""All we have gotten is rhetoric from the governor, the PUC and the utilities,"" he said. ??* An $ 850-million plan to entice Californians to conserve precious megawatts appears to be running into roadblocks, compounding predictions by state officials of tighter than expected energy supplies in May and June. ??Davis signed the conservation spending package last week, earmarking $ 242 million of the new funds for the Public Utilities Commission to distribute to the state's investor-owned utilities to support existing conservation programs. ??But Barbara Hale, director of the PUC's Division of Strategic Planning, said Thursday that since Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy protection April 6, the utility has stopped releasing conservation funds. ??Hale, testifying before a state Senate committee, said PG&E's decision--coupled with the threat that Southern California Edison could follow a similar route to U.S. Bankruptcy Court--has complicated her agency's efforts. ??PG&E spokeswoman Staci Homrig said her company plans to petition the Bankruptcy Court to have the conservation funds designated as a trust and separated from assets tied up in the bankruptcy proceedings. She said if the court denies the request, PG&E would ask to be permitted to pay the expenses anyway. The process, she added, could take about a month--too long in the view of some legislators, given increasingly gloomy energy forecasts for late spring and early summer. ??Deputy Director Bob Therkelsen of the California Energy Commission said his agency had been counting on a number of small power producers to bolster their output during that period. But he said some producers did not purchase the necessary equipment because PG&E and Edison have failed to pay them in full for earlier electricity deliveries. ??""It's not a huge amount,"" he said of the anticipated production shortfall, ""but every little bit helps."" ??* ??Landsberg reported from Los Angeles, Bustillo from Sacramento.

There is some willingness, they say, to consider some price controls, even though the Bush administration is adamantly opposed to such measures. ??Many are looking to see if President Bush's choices for the two vacancies on FERC will provide a margin for change. ??But the commission's basic philosophy that open, unregulated markets are best is not likely to change soon, members say. ??""I've been championing a revamping of FERC's antiquated standards for determining market-based rates,"" Commissioner Richard Massey said Thursday. But with no success. "" My agency is not on the verge of turning on a dime on this market-based pricing."" ??The standards are a joke, Massey added, because the commission never turns down requests for such pricing authority. More than 600 power sellers have been given that authority, he said. ??For a power company to be allowed to charge whatever the market will bear, it must show FERC, for example, that it doesn't have the power to manipulate the market and drive prices up. ??""Any seller that can't pass our screen needs to fire their consultants and lawyers,"" Massey said. ??While the overall philosophy remains consistent, FERC staff has proposed to the commission that a Stage 3 electricity emergency in California should trigger cost-based rates, a form of price controls. Such triggers would be in place for one year, under the staff proposal. ??The commission may decide Wednesday whether to accept that proposal. It has to make some decision by May 1 on how the market will be monitored from now on. ??The theory behind controlling prices in Stage 3, says a FERC staff report, is that during such an emergency generators have the greatest opportunity to manipulate the market and drive prices up. ??But generators have that power during Stage 2 and Stage 1 emergencies, says Les Starck, Southern California Edison Co.'s manager of federal regulatory affairs. Price caps during Stage 3 might avert the rolling blackouts associated with that level of crisis, but they wouldn't do anything to stop generators from jacking up prices the rest of the time, he said. ??It is not clear how long it would take for such price controls to take effect, should the commission go along with the staff recommendation. ??""We're close because summer is approaching,"" Commissioner Linda Breathitt said Thursday. Breathitt, who had firmly opposed any form of price controls, said in an interview last month that given the worsening crisis in California she was open to considering some short-term measures. ??""It's important to me that we address the summer,"" Breathitt said, but said she wasn't able to predict what the commission would do Wednesday. ??Even if an order is approved, Massey said, there could be delays while the power sellers file their costs with regulators and disputes over those filings are handled. ??Sen. Dianne Feinstein said Thursday such a move by the commission would be ""better than having no controls at all. There's no question that we're going to be in a Stage 3 emergency."" ??Feinstein, D-Calif., and other Western lawmakers have been urging FERC to step in sooner and with price controls that extend beyond just the emergency period. ??Waiting for Stage 3 to intervene ""is putting the whole grid at risk,"" said Roger Hamilton, a member of Oregon's Public Utility Commission. ""We have a real stability problem when you cut it that close."" ??Feinstein says the future could well rest with the new commissioners, particularly Patrick Wood, the head of the Texas PUC who many believe will replace Curt Heber as FERC chairman if he is confirmed by the Senate. ??Even if Massey and Breathitt agree on broader price controls, as chairman, Heber could block consideration of such a move. It's unclear what stance Wood would take as chairman. ??""The thing that deeply concerns me about Pat Wood is that he's from Texas,"" Feinstein said. ""What's reassuring is that it appears from my personal discussion with him is that he appears to be pragmatic."" ??But once again, timing could be a problem. ??Bush has said he intends to nominate Wood and Nora Brownell, a member of the Pennsylvania PUC, but has not formally sent their nominations to the Senate. ??""The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is of vital importance right now, and to let the time go on without filling the spots makes no sense,"" Feinstein said. ""Please please please, President Bush, process your nominees."" ??KRT CALIFORNIA is a premium service of Knight Ridder/Tribune ??(c) 2001, The Orange County Register (Santa Ana, Calif.). ??Visit the Register on the World Wide Web at http://www.ocregister.com/ JOURNAL-CODE: OC LOAD-DATE: April 20, 2001 of 78 DOCUMENTS ??????????????Copyright 2001 Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service ???????????????????????Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service Jose Mercury News 20, 2001, Friday SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS KR-ACC-NO: ?K512 LENGTH: 696 words HEADLINE: In response to power woes, rating agencies have California on credit watch BYLINE: By Jennifer Bjorhus BODY: ??SAN JOSE, Calif. _ All three of the nation's influential judges of credit risk now have California on credit watch, saying they are deeply concerned about the economic impact of the state's power crisis. ??The Fitch credit rating agency made it unanimous Wednesday when it warned that the thickening electricity quagmire, as well as lower than expected tax revenues in February and March, could spell broader risk for the state's budget. ??The announcement is a signal that Fitch, too, may downgrade its ratings on California's nearly $30 billion in public debt, a move which could cost taxpayers millions. ??The announcement comes as state lawmakers mull a bailout plan for Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. sits in bankruptcy and state officials bleed through the state's general fund as they purchase expensive electricity for consumers. Earlier this week, Gov. Gray Davis announced that the average daily bill for electricity purchases has risen from $45.8 million a day in the last week of March, to $73 million a day. ??Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's have already issued their own credit warnings, although none of the three agencies has actually downgraded the state's very good double-A credit rating. ??Bond ratings are important yardsticks that bankers and investors use to price municipal and corporate bonds. A downgrade would force California to offer bondbuyers higher interest rates going forward, costing taxpayers. ??The state was last at a lower A rating back in 1994. ??Moody's changed California's Aa2 general obligation bond rating outlook from stable to negative on April 6, the day Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy. Standard & Poor's has had the state's AA rating outlook at negative since January, when the state began buying electricity for the utilities. ??The deciding factor for Fitch, said Fitch vice chairman Claire Cohen, was the disagreement over how the money from the new electricity rate hike will be spent. ??The California Public Utilities Commission ruled in late March that money generated by higher electricity bills should go first to pay the state Department of Water Resources, which has been buying electricity for the utilities. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. has argued that if the state is paid first, there won't be any money left for it. ??The utility is formally challenging the PUC decision, and the move threatens to hold up the estimated $12 billion to $14 billion of bonds the Department of Water Resources plans to issue to buy more electricity. ??""With that being appealed you don't have a clean authorization,"" Cohen said. ""It signals to me that it could delay the financing process."" ??A second concern is that the state isn't collecting as much in taxes as expected, Cohen said. Tax collections for both February and March were below forecast. The amount of personal income tax the state collected in those months fell short by $455 million, or 14% less than expected. ??Cohen said she made her decision before hearing that the state's power costs now exceed $70 million a day. Cohen and David Hitchcock, the California analyst for Standard & Poors, agreed those rising costs are a definite concern. ??""It doesn't take much of a change in economic growth to make some of these projected fund balances disappear and so we're very worried about what the current economic activity is, particularly in Northern California with some of the problems with the high tech area,"" Hitchcock told analysts and investors last week in a conference call. ??State treasurer Phillip Angelides was traveling Thursday and couldn't be reached for comment. Other economy-watchers expressed concern. ??Sandy Harrison, assistant director of the state Dept. of Finance, said the move reinforced the importance of solving the current power problems soon. ??""It's important to note that the rating hasn't been lowered yet and does remain very strong,"" he said. ??KRT CALIFORNIA is a premium service of Knight Ridder/Tribune ??(c) 2001, San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.). ??Visit Mercury Center, the World Wide Web site of the Mercury News, at http://www.sjmercury.com/ JOURNAL-CODE: SJ LOAD-DATE: April 20, 2001 of 78 DOCUMENTS ??????????????Copyright 2001 Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service ???????????????????????Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service Jose Mercury News 20, 2001, Friday SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS KR-ACC-NO: ?K520 LENGTH: 1069 words HEADLINE: Issues still remain on what power consumers will eventually pay BYLINE: By John Woolfolk and Michael Bazeley BODY: ??SAN JOSE, Calif. _ State regulators last month announced an electric rate increase that would average a whopping three cents per kilowatt hour, hit bills beginning in May and punish power pigs while sparing energy misers. ??Now, much of that is up in the air. ??Higher rates are surely coming _ but not before June. Exactly which consumers and businesses will pay how much is uncertain as regulators rush to forge a rate structure from a tangle of more than 20 proposals. ??Their task has been complicated immeasurably by Gov. Gray Davis' decision to weigh in with a competing rate plan and Pacific Gas & Electric's move into bankruptcy court. ??""Little details are moving billions of dollars around,"" said Nettie Hoge of consumer advocate group TURN. ??All the proposals assume a ""tiered"" structure that forces the heaviest users of energy to pay the most. But key details yet to be decided mean consumers could see their average rates go up anywhere from 7 percent to 30 percent or more. ??Among them: ??_How much of an overall increase? The Public Utilities Commission approved a 3-cent per kilowatt hour increase last month, which would boost utility revenue $4.8 million. Gov. Gray Davis' hike _ left vague in Davis' April 5 television address _ averages 2.8 cents for PG&E customers but only 2.3 cents for customers of Southern California Edison. ??_What regions of the state will pay? The commission agreed to raise rates only for Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison, but Davis would include the additional 1.2 million San Diego Gas & Electric customers. ??_Should heavier users of electricity subsidize those who are exempt from the new rate increase? If so, those users will find themselves paying much more than any of the average increase figures being tossed about. ??_How will utilities bill customers retroactively for the increase? At the time of the PUC vote on March 27, commissioner said their increase would take effect immediately. ??Various plans are being presented this week to an administrative law judge working for the commission. The judge is expected to recommend a rate structure to the PUC on May 4. Public hearings would follow May 7-11, and the commission would vote on a plan May 14, condensing to a few weeks a process that normally lasts nearly a year. ??Each of the major proposals before the commission assumes that residential customers using less than 130 percent of their baseline would be exempt from higher rates. That's mandated under a new law that allows the state to buy power. Customers already pay higher rates for exceeding their baseline, which is the average basic level of use for each region of the state. ??Each major proposal also sets new ""tiers"" with progressively higher rates for ""medium"" use at 130 to 200 percent of baseline and ""heavy"" use over 200 percent of that level. ??But that's where the similarities end. ??The first distinction among the leading plans comes in the form of an assumption: How many residential customers will avoid any increase because they don't exceed 130 percent of their baseline? Davis says more than half, commissioners say a little under half and PG&E says less than a third. ??The second difference among the plans is a real difference: What happens to everyone else? ??Under the plan by utilities commission President Loretta Lynch, medium PG&E users would see average bills rise 9 percent and heavy users would see bills increase 36 percent. ??Davis' plan says medium PG&E users would see average bills rise 11 percent while heavy users would pay 37 percent more. But the average total bill increase for PG&E residential customers, including those who are exempt, would be 20 percent under his plan and 24 percent under Lynch's, according to a statement on the governor's web site. ??Business customers would see proportionately greater increases, averaging 30 percent under Lynch's proposal and 26 percent under Davis'. ??The most consumer-friendly of the various proposals comes from consumer-rights group TURN. They suggest an overall average residential increase of just 7.5 percent. ??TURN's plan assumes utilities cannot charge other customers more to make up for the energy misers shielded from rate increases under state law. ??PG&E disagrees with that interpretation. The utility wants other residential users to make up for any lost revenue from exempted customers through higher rates. Under the utility's plan, residential customers would see an average rate hike of nearly 30 percent. ??""The proposal these folks are pushing rips the heart out of that law,"" said Matthew Freedman, staff attorney for TURN. ??Another issue affecting consumers is how the utilities can bill for electricity used in April and May, before the final plan is approved. ??Utility officials have objected to making the rate structure retroactive. Instead, to recoup the revenue, they are proposing a flat surcharge that everyone would pay, regardless of how much they use. ??Edison proposes a higher surcharge added to bills for a shorter period of time _ in this case, June through August. PG&E officials are suggesting a smaller surcharge that would be spread out over 12 months. ??""It'll probably be something closer to the PG&E proposal,"" Paul Clanon, the commission's director of energy issues. ??All the rate increase proposals stem from a commonly understood problem: California's current, frozen rates don't generate enough money to cover the wholesale price of power. The PUC raised rates 10 percent _ or 1 cent per kilowatt hour _ in January in an attempt to help, but that turned out to be far from enough. ??In March, the Commission approved an additional 3-cent increase. But Davis followed quickly with an alternative proposal. The next day, PG&E filed for bankruptcy, raising the specter that a federal judge could order even higher rates. ??Although the PUC has sole authority to raise rates under state law, Davis' proposal has complicated an already complex process. The governor appointed three of the five members of the commission, and his appointees seem inclined to show him deference. But Davis has been slow in filing the details of his plan, which has made it hard for the PUC to proceed. ??KRT CALIFORNIA is a premium service of Knight Ridder/Tribune ??(c) 2001, San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.). ??Visit Mercury Center, the World Wide Web site of the Mercury News, at http://www.sjmercury.com/ JOURNAL-CODE: SJ LOAD-DATE: April 20, 2001 of 78 DOCUMENTS ?????????????????Copyright 2001 The Chronicle Publishing Co. ?????????????????????????The San Francisco Chronicle ????????????????????APRIL 20, 2001, FRIDAY, FINAL EDITION SECTION: NEWS; Pg.

Financial analysts said a worsening of the state's energy mess would increase the possibility of higher electricity rates. ???Nevertheless, lawmakers are unlikely to accept the Edison deal -- at least not in its present form. ???""We are going to go through this thing extensively,"" said state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco. ""There are a lot of concerns about the valuation."" ???Still, he said, legislative backing for the accord remains possible as long as Edison is open to amending some of the terms. ???""The Edison people are smart enough to know that the Legislature is going to have its say,"" Burton said. ???Indeed, sources familiar with the matter said Edison expected a certain amount of tinkering with the deal and would not resist efforts to reach common ground with lawmakers. ???""The Assembly members do not view bankruptcy as a favorable alternative,"" said Assemblyman Herb Wesson, D-Los Angeles.

On Wednesday, rating agency Fitch Inc. joined Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investor Service in warning that California's credit rating could be lowered because of the state's energy mess. ???""The state may be forced to issue junk bonds,"" said Carol Coale, an energy-industry analyst at Prudential Securities in New York. ""This could lead to a surcharge on electricity bills to guarantee the bonds."" ???Bryson, not surprisingly, defended Edison's agreement with the governor as a prudent alternative to bankruptcy. ???""This is a very good deal for the state,"" he said. ""It is not a bailout. Edison gives up a lot to make all this possible."" ???Southern California Edison will sell its power lines to the state for $2.8 billion. It also will provide low-cost power to California for 10 years and drop a federal lawsuit seeking full recovery of nearly $5 billion in past debt. ???Critics say the state is paying far too much for Edison's transmission system -- more than two times book value -- and that the power lines are of little use unless PG&E's grid also can be acquired. ???""It's a multibillion-dollar ratepayer bailout of Edison,"" said Doug Heller, a spokesman for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. ""Edison gets off scot-free."" ???Under the most likely scenario, lawmakers will seek to reduce the amount paid for Edison's power lines and to increase the role of the California Public Utilities Commission in regulating the utility. ???They also will try to come up with a workable contingency plan for the state if PG&E remains adamant in its refusal to sell off its part of the power grid. ???""The deal on the table is still salvageable,"" said Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. ""But Edison needs to understand that what it got from the governor is only a framework, not set in stone."" ???For his part, Bryson signaled that plenty of room existed for give and take on the issue. ???""We're just at the initial stage,"" he said.

PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. ??Edison is continuing to work with state officials and its creditors. ??The utility said its board of directors decided to withhold bonuses to all but two key executives because the financial effects of the energy crisis have overshadowed all other aspects of company and individual performance. ??The two executives who did get bonuses earned them for their roles in preserving the viability of the companies during the crisis and for retention purposes, Edison said. ??Ted Craver, senior vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer at Edison International, was paid $375,000 in 2000 and received a $100,000 bonus. His total compensation in 1999 was $652,100. ??Harold Ray, executive vice president at Southern California Edison, received a salary of $390,000 in 2000 and a bonus of $50,000. His cash compensation in 1999 was $818,400. ??PG&E paid Chairman Robert D. Glynn Jr. $945,086 in salary and benefits during 2000, a 58 percent decrease from $2.26 million in the prior year, according to the company's proxy statement. ??Glynn, 57, received a 12.5 percent increase in his base salary but didn't get a bonus. ??Gordon R. Smith, who runs Pacific Gas and Electric, received a 14.5 percent raise in his base salary to $630,000 but didn't receive a bonus. In 1999, Smith's compensation package totaled $1.1 million.

The previous administration felt compelled to dominate the evening news every day and the president said, 'I'm focused on getting the job done,""' Rove said Wednesday in an Associated Press interview. ??Running a low-key presidency sets Bush apart from former President Clinton, but the style has its critics. ??Some lawmakers, including members of his own party, said Bush could have saved more of his $1.6 trillion tax-cut plan if he had personally lobbied more lawmakers. ??Bush issued a statement expressing sympathy with police and protesters in Cincinnati, but ran the risk of looking detached. ??And Rove acknowledged that there was some discussion in the White House about Bush attending the U.S. crew's homecoming to reap the public relations reward for freeing the crew. ??But the president vetoed the idea, according to Rove, who quoted Bush as saying, ""I want it to be about them and I don't want to go through the discombobulation that it would require of them and their families for me to show up."" ??It is not hard to imagine Clinton commanding center stage during city riots, a budget battle or an international crisis, but Rove said, ""We intended to have a smaller profile than the previous administration."" ??Bush's ""attitude is that he's not going to be measured by whether or not he gets on the evening news but on whether or not he gets progress,"" Rove said during the 45-minute interview. ??He sat at a polished wood conference table in his West Wing office, his hands folded over a memo he had discretely turned upside down. Newspapers and a Starbucks coffee mug littered his desktop. Framed photos and artwork were propped against a chair, still awaiting hanging on his 89th day in the White House. ??A painting of a Texas landscape decorated one wall, allowing Bush's political strategist of eight years to ""go on vacation whenever I'm on the phone."" ??Rove is on the telephone a lot these days crafting strategies to pass the White House legislative agenda, maintain GOP control of Congress in 2002 and position the president for a re-election bid in 2004. ??Bush narrowly won the White House without California's 54 electoral votes, and Rove said the president could win re-election without the state ""but it's always nicer to carry the Golden State."" ??He said the state's electricity shortage will not hurt Bush's chances in 2004, adding that the administration has done ""virtually everything"" Gov. Gray Davis has requested. ??He suggested that the state caused its own problems by not building enough power plants and failing to follow the lead of other states, such as Bush's Texas, to establish sound energy policies before a crisis struck. ??""This has got a very human dimension to it,"" Rove said. ""It's one thing to talk about power supplies. It's another thing when you talk about how it affects their jobs, how it's affecting their livelihoods, how it's affecting the safety of their communities and the health of their families. This is a tough issue and it ought to be a wake up call for the entire country."" ??A White House task force headed by Vice President Dick Cheney is working on recommendations to address both short-term problems of soaring electricity and natural gas prices and longer-term energy supply problems, focusing on producing more domestic oil and gas and building more electric power plants. ??Rove said the administration will soon unveil new conservation measures aimed at helping California ease its shortages. ??He said Bush and his political team are bringing House Republicans from politically competitive states to the White House, where they discuss their districts' needs and, often, gain local media attention. ??Bush also plans to attend fund-raisers for House and Senate campaign committees, helping the party gear up for 2002 midterm elections in which control of Congress is at stake. ??Rove also said: ??-Bush will not seek broad authority to negotiate trade treaties anytime soon, allowing time to make the legislation more attractive to Democrats. ""You can only put so much into that pipe, and we've stuffed it,"" he said of Bush's crowded legislative agenda. The ""fast track"" authority is key to Bush's plans for a free trade zone stretching from Canada to Chile. That proposal is the focus of the three-day Summit of the Americas beginning Friday in Quebec City. ??-Americans will support Bush's environmental policies despite criticism of his decision to overturn some initiatives of the final days of the Clinton administration. Rove stopped short of accusing Clinton of setting Bush up for political troubles. ""I'm not certain I see a conspiracy there. I do think it's interesting"" that Clinton waited until the last moment to act. ??-Bush has not wavered since the campaign in his view that states should be able to opt out of minimum wage increases passed by Congress. ""We are not all one single labor market,"" Rove said.

The regulatory staff recommends a $108.7 million increase. For residential customers, a requested 34-percent hike would be reduced to 16 percent. ??""This is not a final decision,"" said Jeff Beaman, a spokesman for IDACORP and Idaho Power. ""In many cases, the commissioners disagree with the staff."" ??The report noted there was nothing illegal about the transactions between Idaho Power and its sister company, Idaho Energy Systems. To change that, the staff urged commissioners to create a mechanism that forces Idaho Power to buy electricity at the same price Idaho Energy Systems pays for it. ??The report said Idaho Energy Systems, an unregulated subsidiary of IDACORP, repeatedly purchased electricity on the wholesale market and then sold it to Idaho Power for a profit. ??Idaho Power officials contend the recommended policy change could financially cripple the company. It already spent $161 million buying power on the open market and cannot recover the money unless the coming year's rate is increased. ??""The failure to recoup these funds could lead to liquidity problems,"" Beaman said, ""and that will hurt not only the company but our customers as well."" ??But IDACORP paid all of its salaried staff - including Idaho Power employees - a 15-percent bonus at the end of the last fiscal year because the company had achieved record profits of $139.9 million, 53 percent over the year before. ??Beaman said incentive payments have no impact on the rate request. ??Charging the higher rate between the two subsidiaries was the result of a commission order tying the price that Idaho Energy charges for wholesale electricity to the Mid-Columbia Index. The index has been pegged at unrealistic levels since the energy crisis erupted in California, and fluctuates constantly. ??""We are confident that the transactions were performed within the letter and spirit of the law, and have not been at the expense of ratepayers,"" Beaman said. ??Commission spokesman Gene Fadness said commissioners cannot comment on a case before them, but their ultimate decision can be appealed to the Idaho Supreme Court. ??The Public Utilities Commission staff also recommended: ??- Deferring $66.1 million of Idaho Power's rate request, without interest, until answers are available about the company's electricity deals. ??- Deferring another $45.8 million of the request until next year, when the commissioners would allow Idaho Power to collect 5-percent interest. That part of the hike was earmarked for wholesale power purchases this year - purchases that the staff believes will be much more expensive next year. ??- Cutting another $10.3 million from the increase request, contending it was an error by Idaho Power's Risk Management Committee that the company planned on passing on to ratepayers. ??- Implementing a low-interest loan program to encourage energy conservation by Idaho Power customers. ??- A two-year phase-in of any rate increase ultimately approved that is substantially over 20 percent. ??- Changing residential rates to a three-tiered system to encourage savings. ??Homeowners would pay 5.52 cents per kilowatt-hour for the first 800 kwh used, 6.12 cents per kwh for use between 800 kwh and 2,000 kwh, and 7.48 cents per kwh for use over 2,000 kwh. The current residential rate of 5.2 cents per kwh. ??The staff report also took Idaho Power to task, saying it was warned of the possibility of spiraling prices and power shortages as far back as 1995. ??But the company contends it did not want to build generating plants during the past decade because with electricity deregulation looming, nobody knew what independent power facilities were being considered.

""It's obviously way higher than $100 million."" ??Natural gas rates at the California border generally tracked national prices until November, when they spiked as high as 11 times higher than the price of natural gas elsewhere in the nation, Carpenter said. ??""I have never seen gas prices like this anywhere in the world,"" said Carpenter, who has been studying the energy market for 20 years for Cambridge, Mass.-based consultant The Brattle Group. The Brattle Group was hired by Edison to study the natural gas market. ??The committee is one of two legislative committees exploring whether illegal market manipulation in the electricity and natural gas markets has driven up California's energy costs. ??""This is a market that is plagued by the exercise of market power,"" Frank Wolak, chairman of the California Independent System Operator's Market Surveillance Committee, told the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market. The ISO runs the state's power grid. ??However, ""there is no law against me saying, 'I'm not going to sell to you,""' Wolak said. Market manipulation only becomes illegal when there is collusion, Wolak said, and such evidence is hard to find. ??Electricity generators and natural gas suppliers say a severe supply and demand imbalance - not market manipulation - has led to higher prices. ??""Everybody's busy doing investigations. They're not interested in solving the problem,"" said Independent Energy Producers Executive Director Jan Smutny-Jones. ??Investigations ""are wasting everybody's time,"" Smutny-Jones said, adding that previous probes and lawsuits have uncovered no wrongdoing. He said the state's power problems came because state regulators denied utilities the chance to sign long-term energy contracts when they had the chance. ??""People have been playing by the rules,"" Smutny-Jones said. ??But the Senate committee's first witnesses are ISO officials who authored studies that claim the state paid more than $6 billion too much for power last year. ??Committee chair Joseph Dunn, D-Garden Grove, also has slated state Auditor Elaine Howell, who last month blamed buyers and sellers for skyrocketing electricity costs. Dunn also has scheduled future testimony from state, federal, academic and private investigators studying the power market. ??He invited five major generators to attend the committee's second hearing next week. All five - Reliant, Dynegy, Williams Energy, Duke Energy and Mirant - say they are eager to cooperate and clear their names, Dunn said. ??Dunn asked the five for a total of 86 specific documents. If the companies feel they cannot provide documents because of legal or confidentiality concerns, Dunn said he will subpoena them. ??Smutny-Jones said investigators appear to be growing desperate to blame the state's natural gas and electricity price hikes on illegal market manipulation instead of natural market forces. ??He cited Attorney General Bill Lockyer's announcement last week that any informant who helped prove wrongdoing would be entitled to a percentage of the state's recovery he estimated could range from $50 million to hundreds of millions of dollars. ??""If the state's offering a $50 million reward, they haven't found anything,"" Smutny-Jones said. ""I don't think you're going to find the fact that anybody did anything criminal here."" ??Assemblywoman Jenny Oropeza, D-Long Beach, said she believes otherwise after Wednesday's testimony: ""I think it is very clear there was some price manipulation going on."" ??But Assemblyman John Campbell, R-Irvine, isn't sure there was anything illegal. ??""There clearly are market forces at work, that's evident,"" Campbell said. ""Whether you make the jump to market manipulation ... I haven't seen conclusive evidence that leads me to make that jump."" LOAD-DATE: April 20, 2001

Subject:: nan
Body:: Several employees have asked about the exercise policy on stock options. Specifically, they want to know what the exercise policy is on i) termination eg as a result of the prc process, ii) voluntary departure, iii) retirement, or iv)resignation; and to what extent do the rules vary across plans: i) AESOP, LTIP, deferred bonus etc. The main focus is on the length of time to exercise. I am concerned that there may be some odd incentives in the structure -- eg are severed employees allowed more time to exercise than employees who just leave voluntarily ( ie if you want to have a full three years to exercise options are you better off becoming a performance issue and getting severed than you would be if you simply left the company?

Subject:: RE: NERC Meeting Today
Body:: There was an all day meeting of the NERC/reliability legislation group today. I will provide a more detailed report, but the group completed the process of reviewing the changes that some had suggested to shorten and streamline the NERC ""electric reliability organization"" legislation. Sarah and I asked a series of questions and made comments on our key issues and concerns. I want to give you a more complete report once I have gone back over the now ""final draft"" version. The timing being imposed by NERC is that they will circulate a ""clean"" version of the proposal tomorrow or Monday. They have asked for comments by next Thursday, August 16th, with an indication of whether each company/organization does or does not sign on to support it. They will then transmit the proposal and the endorsement letter to Congress and the Administration so they have it as Hill and Energy Dept. staff work on electricity drafting issues this month. I pointed out that EPSA is not due to meet internally with its members to discuss these issues until after the NERC deadline. That is not deterring NERC from moving forward with the above time frame.

Subject:: Virginia Manufacturers Association Seminar -- June 19, 2001
Body:: Steve - take a look at this and contact the sponsor with a yes or no. Thanks ---------------------- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/NA/Enron on 05/10/2001 09:23 AM --------------------------- Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. From: Sherri Sera 05/09/2001 12:06 PM To: Mark Palmer/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: Virginia Manufacturers Association Seminar -- June 19, 2001 Is this anything we want to get involved in? SRS ---------------------- Forwarded by Sherri Sera/Corp/Enron on 05/09/2001 12:07 PM --------------------------- rdcarson@aep.com on 05/09/2001 11:46:21 AM To: sherri.sera@enron.com cc: swalker@vmaonline.org, blanchfield_wl@nns.com Subject: Virginia Manufacturers Association Seminar -- June 19, 2001 Sherry, thanks for your guidance concerning the possibility of an Enron participant for the VMA's Seminar on Electric Utility Restructuring scheduled for June 19, 2001. I serve as Chairman of the VMA's Energy Resources Committee which will be responsible for the seminar and the day-long agenda it will entail. As I explained, depending upon the availability of Mr. Skilling or another key individual, the VMA is offering Enron an opportunity to participate in its seminar in an important way. We seek to have Enron speak on the subject of the developing competitive market and how that market may be accessible and beneficial to VMA's member manufacturers which include many, if not most, of the large companies residing in Virginia. The purpose of the seminar is entirely educational, as customers in Virginia will be able, under the terms of the Electric Utility Industry Restructuring Act passed in 1999, to choose their supplier of electricity as early as January 1, 2002, and by no later than January 1, 2003. The subject is becoming a high priority for VMA members, given the prominence of energy issues today generally, and the imminence of the date when choice will be available to Virginia customers. We envision that Enron's message could be encouraging for VMA members who today hear much about the dilemma in California (another seminar participant will speak on the status of restructuring initiatives in California and other states) and understandably wonder about the prospects for successful competition and effective choice in Virginia. Enron could hopefully explain how market benefits might accrue to manufacturers once the day of choice arrives, touching on Enron's online trading platform, aggregation possibilities (an alternative which the VMA, as an umbrella organization, is considering), and related topics. The seminar will begin at 8:30am and conclude at 4:30pm, with the possible Enron presentation beginning immediately following lunch at 1:00pm. We expect good attendance on the part of VMA members, and plan to offer attendance opportunities to regulatory commission personnel, legislators and others who have been closely involved with the development of the Virginia restructuring model as it has evolved over the past five years or so. I will appreciate hearing from you at your earliest convenience, and again thank you for your assistance. I will be happy to discuss the particulars with you or anyone else, should that be helpful, and can be reached at AEP's state office in Richmond at 804-698-5511.

Subject:: Restructuring (Confidential Communications)
Body:: At the right time, it would be helpful to discuss what we may want to consider as ""Core"" Assets (unrelated to trading activities) for purposes of emerging from bankruptcy as a going concern. As you know, we are in the process of organizing and formatting in an asset matrix the assets/businesses we currently own (or otherwise have an interest in) that may be potentially for sale; separating out potential core assets will be instructive as part of this process. Please let me know your thoughts/suggestions over the next few weeks. Thanks. Jordan

You are quoted mid-way through re Houston emissions. Tx Andrew Meet Enron, Bush's biggest contributor Pratap Chatterjee 09/01/2000 The Progressive 23 Copyright (c) 2000 Bell & Howell Information and Learning Company. All rights reserved. Copyright Progressive Incorporated Sep 2000 Early last October, members of the ninth grade girls' track team and the boys' football team at suburban Houston's Deer Park High School's north campus returned from practice reporting severe breathing problems. That day, Deer Park registered 251 parts of ozone per billion, more than twice the federal standard, and Houston surpassed Los Angeles as the smoggiest city in the United States. One of the biggest contributors to Deer Park's pollution is a plant owned by Enron, Houston's wealthiest company. Enron and its executives are also the single largest contributors ($550,000 and counting) to the political ambitions of Texas Governor George W Bush, Republican candidate for President of the United States. Kenneth Lay, the chief executive of Enron, has personally given at least $250,000 in soft money to Bush's political campaigns. He is also one of the ""Pioneers""-a Bush supporter who has collected $100,000 in direct contributions of $1,000 or less. What is Enron? And what does it get in return for this largesse? Enron is the largest buyer and seller of natural gas in the country. Its 1999 revenues of $40 billion make it the eighteenth largest company in the United States. Enron invests in energy projects in countries around the world, including Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mozambique, and the Philippines. The company has recently expanded onto the Internet, buying and selling a dizzying array of products ranging from pulp and paper to petrochemicals and plastics, as well as esoteric products like clean air credits that utilities purchase to meet emission limits. Texas activists say that the tight connection between Bush and Lay bodes ill if Bush is elected. Andrew Wheat, from Texans for Public Justice, a campaign finance advocacy group in Austin, compares the symbiotic relationship between Enron and the governor to ""cogeneration""-a process used by utilities to harness waste heat vented by their generators to produce more power. ""In a more sinister form of cogeneration, corporations are converting economic into political power,"" he says. ""A Bush election fueled by Enron dollars could ignite in the public policy arena, and consumers would get burned."" And so may people in the Third World. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have both criticized Enron for colluding with police who brutally suppressed protests at the company's giant power plant in western India. The plant's operating firm is called the Dabhol Power Company. From 1992 to 1998, Enron owned 80 percent of it, with General Electric and Bechtel each holding a 10 percent share. (In 1998, the Indian state electricity board bought a 30 percent share of the company, which reduced Enron's stake to 50 percent.) For years, the plant has been the site of many nonviolent protests. ""The project has met with opposition from local people and activists from elsewhere in India on the grounds of its social, economic, and environmental impact,"" Amnesty wrote in a July 1997 report. ""Protesters and activists have been subjected to harassment, arbitrary arrest, preventive detention under the ordinary criminal law, and ill treatment. Amnesty International considers those who have been subjected to arrest and temporary periods of imprisonment as a result of undertaking peaceful protest to be prisoners of conscience, imprisoned solely for exercising their right to freedom of expression."" Amnesty's report found that ""women, who have been at the forefront of local agitation, appear to have been a particular target."" Just before dawn on June 3, 1997, police stormed the homes of several women. ""The policemen forcibly opened the door and dragged me out of the house into the police van parked on the road. (While dragging me) the police kept beating me on my back with batons. The humiliation meted out to the other members of my family was similar to the way I was humiliated. . . . My one-and-a-half year-old daughter held on to me but the police kicked her away,"" says Sugandha Vasudev Bhalekar-a twenty-four-year-old housewife who was three months pregnant at the time of her arrest, according to Amnesty's report. Amnesty found that another pregnant woman was beaten and several other women sustained injuries, including bruising, abrasions, and lacerations on arms and legs. Amnesty said the police involved in suppressing protests included ""the Special Reserve Police [SRP] on the site of the company."" It added: ""The involvement of the SRP in the harassment of protesters indicates the need for the three U.S. multinationals participating in the joint venture to take steps to ensure that all the management and staff of the DPC [Dabhol Power Company)-in particular, any security staff subcontracted to, seconded to, or employed by the company-are trained in human rights and are fully accountable for their actions. A January 1999 investigation by Human Rights Watch came to a stronger conclusion. ""Human Rights Watch believes that the Dabhol Power Corporation and its parent company Enron are complicit in these human rights violations,"" it said. ""The company, under provisions of law, paid the abusive state forces for the security they provided to the company. These forces, located adjacent to the project site, were only stationed there to deal with protests. In addition, contractors (for DPC) engaged in a pattern of harassment, intimidation, and attacks on individuals opposed to the Dabhol Power project. . . . The Dabhol Power Corporation refused to acknowledge that its contractors were responsible for criminal acts and did not adequately investigate, condemn, or cease relationships with these individuals."" Enron denies any wrongdoing. ""While we respect the mission of Human Rights Watch, we do not feel that its report on the Dabhol Power project is accurate,"" says an Enron spokesperson. ""The report refers to peaceful protests, when, in fact, the reason the police were positioned near our site is that there have been many acts of violence against our employees and contractors. Dabhol Power Company has worked hard to promote positive relations with the community. Unfortunately, the good relationship we have built with a large percentage of the community was not reflected in the report. Enron is committed to providing energy and communications services while preserving the human rights of citizens and our workers."" Enron has also raised a stink in Bolivia with its involvement in the Cuiaba Integrated Energy Project. The project is run by Transredes, Bolivia's hydrocarbon transport company, which came into being in 1997 after Bolivia privatized its oil sector under the influence of the World Bank. A joint venture of Enron and Shell owns 50 percent of Transredes. On January 31, 2000, a Transredes oil pipeline erupted and dumped an estimated 10,000 barrels of refined crude oil and gasoline into the Desaguadero River, which supports indigenous communities such as the Uru Muratos. ""This problem is Transredes's number one priority, and we are committed to continue to work hard to mitigate the short- and long-term social and environmental impact,"" wrote Steve Hopper, president of Transredes, in a letter addressed ""To the People of Bolivia"" on February 7. Facing starvation from the Loss of their life-sustaining waterfowl and fish, the Uru Muratos left their ancestral lands at the southern shores of Lake Poopo in April and marched eighty-five miles to the city of Oruro to ask for government help. ""We subsequently reached an agreement with them to provide certain levels of relief and assistance,"" says Keith Miceli, general manager for public relations for Enron, South America. In its actions overseas, Enron has made a practice of taking advantage of corporate welfare. And it has enlisted George W Bush in this effort. For example, in March 1997, Lay wrote a letter to Bush that was subsequently released to the press under Texas open records laws, asking him to contact every member of the Texas delegation in Congress to explain how ""export credit agencies of the United States are critical to U.S. developers like Enron, who are pursuing international projects in developing countries."" These agencies include the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), which provides political risk coverage and financial support to U.S. companies investing abroad. ""OPIC provided financing or insurance coverage worth almost $300 million for Enron's foreign projects just last year, according to government records,"" The New York Times reported. ""Enron officials have in the past asked Mr. Bush to help lobby lawmakers to appropriate funds of OPIC, as well as for the Export-Import Bank, another federal agency that aids American companies abroad."" Enron received $200 million in political risk insurance for the Dabhol project in 1996. And it received $200 million in insurance from OPIC in 1999 for its Bolivian project. The Enron Methanol plant in Pasadena, Texas, lies in the Houston Ship Channel area, the nation's largest concentration of petrochemical plants just east of the city. The plant has won special concessions from Governor Bush, allowing the company to pollute without a permit, as well as giving it immunity from prosecution for violating some environmental standards. Plants like this in Texas cumulatively emit twice as much nitrogen oxide, a key ingredient of smog, as do all the nine million cars in Texas put together. Only 7 percent of the more than 3,500 tons of nitrogen oxide emitted by the Enron Methanol plant in 1997 would have been permitted had Enron not gotten away with this under the ""grandfather clause"" of the 1971 Texas Clean Air Act, which allows plants built before 1971 to continue their polluting practices. Bush extended this clause under the 1999 Clean Air Responsibility Enterprise (CARE) program that his office drew up in a series of secret meetings with representatives of the top polluters in the state, as Molly Ivins reported. CARE waives permit requirements for plants that volunteer to cut emissions. The CARE program is backed up by an act that Bush signed in May 1995 giving sweeping protections to polluters that perform internal environmental or safety audits. The law makes these audit documents confidential and allows polluters to escape responsibility for environmental violations. To date, Enron has conducted five such audits and filed for immunity from prosecution for violations of the law, according to the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission (TNRCC), the state equivalent of the Environmental Protection Agency. Tamara Maschini, who lives about five miles from the Enron plant, is one of the founders of a local environmental group called Clean Air Clear Lake. ""Whole families in this neighborhood have asthma because of the pollution from plants like Enron,"" she says. Mark Palmer, head of public relations for Enron, says that the company's contribution to local pollution is minimal. ""If the grandfather clause was canceled right now, we would benefit the most of any of the companies in Texas because our nitrogen oxide emissions add up to less than half a percent of the total,"" he says. Last year, the Bush campaign borrowed Enron's corporate jets eight times to fly aides around the country, more times than any of the thirty-four other companies that made their company aircraft available to the Presidential hopeful. And Lay often acts as George W. Bush's chaperone. On April 7, 2000, he played host to Bush and his father, the former President, at the Houston Astros' first home game of the season. The game was held in the baseball team's brand new stadium-Enron Field-which was built with the help of a $100 million donation from Enron. (The company got free advertising, a tax break, and a $200 million contract to supply power to the stadium in return.) Less than three weeks later, Lay joined candidate Bush in Washington, D.C., for a Republican fundraiser that topped all previous records by bringing in a staggering $21.3 million, easily the biggest one-night haul for any political party in history. ""Ken Lay is a noted business leader in Texas who has long been active in Republican politics,"" says Ray Sullivan, a spokesman for the Bush campaign. ""He is chair of the Governor's Business Council. But the governor has his own agenda based on what he believes is best for Texas and for the country."" For his part, Lay tries to put his contributions in a favorable light. ""When I make contributions to a candidate, it is not for some special favor, it's not even for access-although I'll be the first to admit it probably helps access,"" he told The New York Times. ""It is because I'm supporting candidates I strongly believe in personally."" In January 1999, Enron pitched in $50,000 to help pay for Bush's inaugural bash in Austin, Texas, after he won reelection for governor. Today, the polls show that George W Bush has a better than even chance of winning the Presidential election. If he does, it is very likely Ken Lay will be pitching in for another inaugural bash. Pratap Chatterjee works for the on-line magazine ""Corporate Watch, "" which ran an earlier version of this story. The magazine can be reached at www. corpwatch. org.

LOS ANGELES -- In the latest attempt to fix California's troubled deregulated energy market, officials adopted a unique variable-pricing plan that already is being criticized by power generators and traders as unworkable and praised by utilities and consumers as much needed protection against gouging. Under the plan, adopted late last week by the governing board of the California Independent System Operator, or ISO, a quasipublic agency responsible for maintaining electricity reliability in the state, the cap on wholesale power will be reset hourly from about $65 per megawatt hour at low-demand times to no more than $250 an hour at periods of high demand. It was the third time this year that officials effectively lowered the price cap on wholesale electricity in a bid to contain -- so far unsuccessfully -- soaring total power costs. The move underscores the chaotic atmosphere prevailing in California's power market after a two-year-old experiment in deregulation has come undone. In other deregulated markets such as New York and New England, prices are capped at $1000 per megawatt hour, which are intended to be low enough to prevent market abuse but high enough to give generators incentive to build new plants. California's system was supposed to work the same way. But because utilities in California divested themselves of the bulk of their plants but weren't allowed to lock in fixed-price supply contracts, unlike in the other markets, merchant generators have had much greater sway over prices here on the spot market, where most power trades. During the first nine months of the year, the average price of wholesale electricity was $90 per megawatt hour in California, triple the price of a year earlier. Even on cool days in October, the price generally has remained above $100 per megawatt hour. California utilities have lost money on those power purchases because their customers' rates are frozen at $54 to $65 per megawatt hour, far lower than the average price utilities have had to pay for that power. The deficits exceeded $5 billion in the June-to-September period. California utilities buy the power used by their customers from the state-sanctioned auctions administered by the ISO and a sister organization, the California Power Exchange. In New York and New England, by comparison, less than 20% of power is purchased from the spot markets because utilities there were able to sign the fixed-price contracts, which California utilities weren't allowed to do. The price-cap decision passed last week by a vote of 13 to 10, primarily with support from utilities and board members representing consumer interests. It was pushed aggressively by Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, the state's two big investor-owned utilities that have gotten caught in the price-spike vise this year. Some ISO members say they had no choice but to support the measure to ratchet down price caps. ""We're going after the windfall profits,"" said S. David Freeman, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, who voted for the measure. ""What we've got now is a market accustomed to ripping off the consumer. This can't be allowed to go on."" But other experts said the hasty measure may make California's problems even worse. ""The short-term regulatory fix is always to fix prices,"" said Pam Prairie, director of the Institute of Public Utilities at Michigan State University in East Lansing. ""But there's a real danger you'll set prices too low and make your supply problems even worse."" Other economists agreed. ""At best, this is poorly administered cost-based regulation,"" said Frank Wolak, an economics professor at Stanford University who sits on an independent market-monitoring committee at the ISO. ""At worst, it creates all sorts of perverse market incentives."" For example, it may increase the problem of ""megawatt laundering"" on hot days in which in-state generators sell power to out-of-state customers who then sell it back into the state, effectively bypassing the cap. Likewise, it could encourage generators to build new plants outside of California, rather than where they are needed near its major cities, also to avoid the cap. In the end, it could increase stresses to the state's already overburdened transmission system. In fact, the decision already has brought to a halt the state's forward electricity market, which allows wholesale customers to sign contracts for power they will use in the future. The market had been trading as much as 1,000 contracts a week. On Friday, there was practically no activity. ""This decision shows the height of lunacy,"" said Rick Shapiro, a managing director at Enron Corp., the giant Houston-based energy trader. Mr. Shapiro said Enron and other generators will file appeals at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission asking that the new pricing formula be rescinded. It is possible the FERC may throw out the pricing formula anyway. It is expected to issue a major order on Nov. 1 directing changes in California's market structure. That order will include its determination of the effectiveness of price caps. It also is expected to judge the merits of the governance structure at the ISO, which has lately been marked by infighting. Recently, consumer groups have charged that the ISO board has put the business interests of its members ahead of members' fiduciary duty to California residents. The most recent price-cap measure was approved over the objections of executives at the ISO whose job it will be to implement the formula. ISO Chief Executive Terry Winter said the measure is flawed because it doesn't take into account the amount of power available to the California market. Mr. Winter fears the caps will place the state at a disadvantage relative to neighboring states with no price caps. About 11 states are electrically interconnected in the West, meaning power can be moved between them and chase the highest prices. ""We keep getting accused of making our market too complicated,"" Mr. Winter said. ""Then along comes this proposal"" with caps that would adjust repeatedly throughout the day, depending on demand.

Enron Offers Cash To Help Azurix Take Itself Private By Rebecca Smith Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/30/2000 The Wall Street Journal A12 (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) Enron Corp. offered to lend Azurix Corp., an Enron spinoff, $275 million so that it could take itself private. Enron, which has been frustrated with the global water company's performance, suggested Friday that public shareholders receive a cash offer of $7 a share for their Azurix stock. While nearly double the stock's value prior to the offer, the suggested price nevertheless was far below the $19 at which Azurix made its debut in 1999. An Azurix spokeswoman said the board, on which Enron has seats, had not yet decided how to treat the Enron offer. An Enron spokesman said that taking the company private would ""give us more opportunity to directly affect our investment."" In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Azurix soared $3 to $6.56 in heavy trading. Azurix had hoped to create a splash by doing to the water business what Enron had done to the energy business -- increase competition and provide trading skills capable of creating new financial products out of old commodities. But Azurix stumbled, nearly from the outset. Deregulation of the water business and government privatizations of water systems, on which it was counting, were slow to come, crimping growth opportunities and profit. And Enron, accustomed to higher, faster returns, grew impatient with the capital-intensive water business. The company's first chief executive, Rebecca Mark, a onetime head of Enron's international division, resigned in the summer with the agreement of Enron executives, who said it was time for new leadership. The incoming chief executive, John Garrison, said he would look for buyers for some of the company's businesses; he was unavailable to comment Friday. Ms. Mark was believed to be considering making an offer for some of those businesses, herself. She declined a request for an interview. In its letter to Azurix officers, Enron said the water company received four offers from prospective suitors after Ms. Mark's departure, the best of which came from an unidentified bidder who offered $7 a share and went through a lengthy due-diligence process before backing down, apparently spooked by Azurix's cash flow, capital structure, tax considerations and some securities litigation. In its proposal letter, made public Friday, Enron said it concluded ""that there is no other buyer willing to pay the $7"" and so proceeded with its own offer. But Enron said it won't try to limit Azurix's ability to negotiate a better deal with others, should they come forward. Finally, Enron noted that Azurix had considered various partial or full-liquidation alternatives but said they didn't seem likely to produce more than $7 a share.

Enron Offers Loan to Azurix Enron Corp. offered to lend Azurix Corp., an Enron spinoff, $275 million (327.6 million euros) so that it could take itself private. Enron, which has been frustrated with the global water company's performance, suggested Friday that public shareholders receive a cash offer of $7 a share for their Azurix stock. While nearly double the stock's value prior to the offer, the suggested price nevertheless was far below the $19 at which Azurix made its debut in 1999. (Staff) Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Business Wessex switch likely Adam Jones in New York 10/28/2000 The Times of London News International 2W 64 (Copyright Times Newspapers Ltd, 2000) Wessex Water's American parent company is likely to be taken private after a disastrous 14-month spell as a quoted company. Wessex, which provides water services to the South of England, was bought by Azurix in 1998 for Pounds 1.6 billion. Azurix wanted to use Wessex's expertise in privatised water supply to build a global business. However, since listing at $19 a share in June last year, Azurix stock has gone into freefall, closing at less than $4 earlier this week. Azurix slumped because it drastically misjudged the number of privatisation opportunities. It emerged last night that Enron, the Texan energy and trading company that is Azurix's biggest shareholder, has taken the unusual step of offering to lend Azurix $275 million (Pounds 190 million) to buy its publicly held shares, thereby taking it private. The Enron proposal would value Azurix at about $800 million or $7 per share - 63 per cent less than the IPO price. Enron would control Azurix and Wessex Water if it went private. Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. BUSINESS Enron water unit could go private under loan plan NELSON ANTOSH Staff 10/28/2000 Houston Chronicle 3 STAR 1 (Copyright 2000) Enron offered Friday to lend Azurix, its struggling water affiliate, about $275 million so Azurix can go private by purchasing 38.6 million shares that are publicly traded. The deal would have Azurix buying back its stock at $7 per share, about double what the shares were trading for Thursday. That's a big comedown for Azurix shares, which sold for $19 each when the Houston company went public in June 1999. The maneuver technically can be called a ""take-under,"" said analyst Carol Coale of Prudential Securities in Houston. She also described it as Enron's least painful solution for what to do with the venture that never lived up its ambitious plans. ""Nothing about Azurix has been positive for Enron, in my view,"" said Coale. ""This is a solution to a problem."" Azurix spokeswoman Diane Bazelides said its board is studying Enron's proposal. She added that it was too early to comment on the offer because the proposal's structure had not been outlined. Enron imposed no deadline for a decision by Azurix, but reserved the right to withdraw the offer if Azurix's position with prospective customers and employees deteriorated. One of Enron's conditions is that Azurix not sell any major assets before the buyout. The deal would not change Enron's large stake in Azurix, said Palmer. It owns a third, while the other third is owned by the Atlantic Water Trust, in which Enron owns a 50 percent voting interest. The proposal's advantages include giving public shareholders a premium to the market price, said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer. The common stock of Azurix zoomed Friday on the news, gaining $3 to close at $6.56 on the New York Stock Exchange. Becoming a private company would give Azurix management greater flexibility in restructuring. Coale said it would reduce Azurix's general and administrative costs, helping it to bid against lower- cost foreign competition, particularly two big French companies. Azurix's high cost structure has been its primary problem, she said. Azurix has been looking at cost and strategies ever since it got a new president and chief executive on Aug. 25, said Bazelides. That was the date that Rebecca Mark resigned as Azurix's high-profile chairman and chief executive. Enron and Azurix have been looking at ""strategic alternatives"" for nine months, J. Mark Meets, Enron's executive vice president for corporate development, said in a letter filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. One alternative was selling the company, he said. That didn't work out because the offers from three companies didn't exceed $4 per share. The fourth potential buyer said it would consider offering $7 per share, said Meets. But that suitor backed out, citing reasons like cash flow, complexity of the capital structure, tax considerations and pending securities litigation. ""We are obviously quite disappointed by this most recent turn of events,"" Meets said in the letter. ""However, we strongly believe that there is no other buyer willing to pay the $7 per share initially proposed (but later withdrawn) by the fourth bidder."" Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Ken Herman American-Statesman Capitol Bureau Chief 10/28/2000 Austin American-Statesman A1 (Copyright 2000) Not long ago, at a glossy wooden table in a Texas Capitol office, two of Gov. George W. Bush's high-level appointees discussed one of the key issues in state government these days. It involved the relative merits of White House posts that could be available to the two appointees if Bush becomes president. Asked this week whether it's a common topic around the Capitol, one of the appointees gestured to the anteroom of his office and made a motion indicating that even the midlevel folks have Washington on their minds. Near the banks of the Colorado, Potomac Fever is a near-epidemic. And though it is political faux pas to be too open about doing White House transition planning before Election Day, be assured it is going on at Bush headquarters, where top officials are cognizant of the fine line between looking too confident now and looking too unprepared later. The candidate himself -- as well as his top aides -- steers clear of transition talk. When asked who might wind up in his Cabinet, Bush looks backward instead of forward, saying that his selection of Dick Cheney as his running mate should offer a glimpse of the kind of people who would wind up in his administration. The transition work, such that it is, is under the aegis of longtime Bush friend and aide Clay Johnson, who began as head of the gubernatorial appointments office and now serves as chief of staff. Johnson said nobody has been interviewed for any Washington post, but he has compiled a file of folks who are interested in serving in a Bush administration. Johnson also has been reading up on previous transitions -- ones that went well and ones that didn't. His preliminary conclusion is that the outgoing administrations are generally helpful and supportive, even if they were ousted by the incoming administration. It's the incoming administrations that can make the mistakes, he said. There is no shortage of think tanks that have think-tanked the topic. Back in August, the Heritage Foundation, based in Washington, issued a transition handbook titled ""The Keys to a Successful Presidency."" ""Though we really don't expect either campaign to talk about it (and would discourage them from doing so), the message here is it's time to start planning for a possible presidential transition, quietly, well behind the scenes, but with the understanding that the preparation done during the next 70 or so days, and the work done in the 70 or so days that follow (between the election and the inauguration) will very well determine the initial success or failure of the next administration,"" Herbert Berkowitz, a foundation vice president, said in releasing the study. All indications are that the Bush team has been following the advice, with Johnson at the helm. Johnson cautions against expectations that a Bush administration would be overloaded with Texans. ""It's the United States of America, not the United States of Texas,"" he said. Despite that caveat, there is no shortage of Texans who are considered shoo-ins to fill some of the thousands of slots Bush could offer if he wins. Johnson confirms that he is very interested in a Washington job. Early speculation among Bush aides makes Johnson a potential leading contender for head of personnel at the White House. Karen Hughes, Bush's communications director since his 1994 gubernatorial campaign, is expected to become Bush's press secretary if he wins the White House. Karl Rove, Bush's longtime political guru, also will be on board, though he could wind up with an out-of- the-White-House post, perhaps at the Republican National Committee. Not as certain is the potential future for Joe Allbaugh, who is part of the ""iron triangle"" of top advisers -- along with Rove and Hughes -- who have been on board with Bush since the 1994 campaign. Allbaugh serves as manager of the presidential campaign and previously served as chief of staff in the governor's office. Capitol speculation indicates Allbaugh could decide to skip a White House post, possibly in favor of a lobbying job, if he is not tapped as chief of staff. That post could go to Don Evans, a longtime Bush friend who headed the megasuccessful fund-raising effort for the presidential campaign. However, not everyone has Potomac Fever. For example, Terral Smith, Bush's legislative director, said he will stay in Austin to lobby. In addition to the speculation about appointees, the approaching election has sparked talk about when Bush might leave office if he wins. Under the U.S. Constitution, he could remain governor until he has to become president on Jan. 20. Much more likely, however, is that Bush would leave office sooner than that, perhaps as soon as two or three weeks after the Nov. 7 election, if he wins. That could cause a housing problem for Bush, whose main residence is the Governor's Mansion, which comes as a free perk of the job. The Bushes have a home under construction at their ranch in Crawford, near Waco. The ranch also has a smaller house in which the Bushes now spend weekends. Not out of the question is that Bush could work out an arrangement with Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, who would become governor if Bush resigns, to remain in the Governor's Mansion for several weeks after he leaves office. If the race among Texas senators to replace Perry as lieutenant governor complicates the timing of the resignation, Bush could stay in the governor's office a little longer, but no later than the first week of January. After all, he will want to give Perry time to bask in his gubernatorial inauguration before the Legislature convenes Jan. 9. No matter when Bush resigns, confidantes believe he might use his Crawford ranch for interviews with potential top-level appointees, including Cabinet members.

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A Dynegy executive said Friday that the California Independent System Operator's plan to impose hourly price caps on the wholesale power market will compromise reliability by forcing generators to sell electricity out of state. ""If the ISO says it will not buy above a certain price and generators cannot operate below that price, then we have no choice but to find other markets to participate in,"" said Dynegy senior vice president of marketing and trading asset management Lynn Lednicky. ""That may lead to the ISO not finding the power it needs at a price it wants to pay."" The ISO plans to construct hourly price caps each month based on forecast load, natural gas prices and generation unit efficiency. The caps will take effect Nov. 3 or soon therafter. Dynegy Inc. (DYN) sent a letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission asking it to address reliability consequences of the price caps before Nov. 3. Dynegy specifically requested that FERC discuss the issue at its Nov. 1 meeting, when it will release a report on California's electricity problems. Enron Corp. (ENE) and Southern Company (SO) share Dynegy's concerns about reliability and plan to petition FERC about the issue, said a trader listening in to a conference call between the three companies. -By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872; jessica.berthold@dowjones.com Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES New York -(Dow Jones)- Shares of Azurix Corp. (AZX) jumped 84% in heavy trading Friday after parent Enron Corp. (ENE) proposed to take the company private in a $7-a-share buyout. Filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed that Enron made the proposal after not being satisfied with offers it had received from four third parties for its stake in Azurix. In a letter to two members of Azurix's board, Enron said three potential buyers ""were unlikely to be willing to pay more than the then-current market price of approximately $4 a share."" Enron said a fourth potential buyer indicated it would consider a $7-a-share offer, but it said that proposal was recently withdrawn. ""The reasons given by the bidder included pro forma cash flows, the complexity of the capital structure, tax considerations and the currently pending securities litigation,"" the letter said. Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Houston-based Enron, declined to say whether Enron was entertaining current third-party interests or was in any talks with other parties regarding its Azurix stake. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Azurix ended Friday up $3 to $6.56 on 2.8 million shares, compared with average daily volume of 239,000 shares. Enron was up $1.38, or 1.8%, to $78.88 on 1.6 million shares, compared with its daily average turnover of 2.4 million. In the SEC filing, Enron, saying it's familiar with Azurix's various partial and full liquidation alternatives, said its buyout proposal is conditioned upon Azurix not selling any significant assets prior to the buyout. ""Although we agree that such plans may result in greater value to Azurix's shareholders than the maintenance of the status quo, we believe that these options almost certainly will not result on a present value in a greater return to Azurix's shareholders than $7 a share,"" the letter said. Enron also said its buyout proposal doesn't include any breakup fees or other ""deal protection devices."" This frees Azurix's board to pursue an acquisition that ""might provide greater value"" to shareholders. Daine Bazelides, a spokeswoman for Azurix, declined to say whether Azurix is now entertaining offers for the company. She did, however, confirm the information contained in Enron's filing. ""The historical information in the filing is factually correct,"" she told Dow Jones Newswires. She said she doesn't know when Azurix board will respond to Enron's proposal. In the filing, Enron didn't set a deadline, but warned that Azurix's position with customers and employees may deteriorate further. ""We must therefore reserve the right to withdraw our proposal at any time,"" Enron's letter said. In the letter, Enron pointed out that Azurix had retained two ""internationally recognized investment bankers"" early this year to evaluate strategic alternatives, which included the potential sale of the company to unrelated third parties. Enron said it strongly believes there isn't another buyer willing to pay $7 a share for Enron's indirect interest in Azurix. ""We believe it is in Azurix's best interest, as well as the best interest of its shareholders and employees, if Azurix were no longer a publicly traded company,"" Enron said. -By Christopher C. Williams, Dow Jones Newswires, 201-938-5219; Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Enron offers to buy out Azurix Financial Times By Hillary Durgin in Houston Published: October 27 2000 23:31GMT | Last Updated: October 27 2000 23:36GMT Enron, the Houston-based energy and trading group, said on Friday it had offered up to $275m in funding to take Azurix private at a buy-out price of $7 per share. The specific structure of Enron's proposal has yet to be determined, Enron said. Azurix said its board would now consider the proposal. The timing of any decision was unclear. Enron owns directly and indirectly about 66 per cent of Azurix, the troubled Houston water company, whose main asset is UK-based Wessex Water. The buyout offer is the latest development in a history of problems at Azurix, which was spun off from Enron and taken public at an offering price of $19 per share. But a combination of poor market timing, competitive industry conditions and empty promises by the company on Wall Street took their toll on the company, whose shares have since plummeted and have been trading most recently around the $3-per-share range. In August, Rebecca Mark, Azurix chief executive officer, resigned both from Azurix and from the board at Enron. Enron's offer came after four unnamed parties approached Enron about buying its stake in Azurix. While three of the four were unwilling to pay more than the then market price of about $4 per share, a fourth party who was considering offering $7 per share (before accounting for any dilution for stock options) later declined to pursue the transaction, Enron said in Friday's letter to Azurix, outlining the buyout proposal. ""We strongly believe that our proposal is fair to Azurix's public stockholders,"" the letter stated. ""Our proposed transaction would permit Azurix's stockholders to receive, on a timely basis, a cash payment for their shares that is significantly above the price at which those shares have traded in several months."" Analysts that follow Azurix and had valued the shares at between $6 and $8 per shares said the offer was fair. Analysts that follow Enron said that Azurix's business strategy had proved to be a failure and was characteristic of the hard asset approach that Enron has gradually distanced itself from. Enron's shares closed at $78.88 up $1.38 on Friday. Azurix's shares rose $3 to close at $6.56.

Subject:: Today's Senate Hearing
Body:: The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee held an unusually long hearing today (9:30 am to 4:30 pm) on FERC's responses to the California situation and other related energy issues. The ""star witness"" was Gov. Davis. Others were Govs. Martz of Montana and Hoeven of North Dakota against price caps, Sens. Murkowski, Murray and Cantwell, Washington State's attorney general, Oregon's PUC chairman, and the five FERC commissioners. Once Davis left after several hours of testimony and two rounds of questions, most of the press and audience left. Enron was mentioned several times as follows: 1. Sen. Thompson, the Ranking Republican, mentioned Lockyer's ""Spike"" comments in the context of asking Gov. Davis about why business would make new investments in the state when on top of the regulatory uncertainty, there is the broader political hostility expressed in this way by state officials. Davis had two chances to disavow Lockyer and did not. (Thompson gave him a second chance when he basically repeated the question and made specific reference again to ""Spike,"" asking Davis if FERC acted this week because of the AG's Spike comments.) The first time Davis said that the people he represents are mad, they want him to fight back, this is rough business, the industry people are used to a wildcatter's environment, things occassionally get out of hand, and we are not going to take it. On the second instance, he said that the state was building new power plants and investment was not being diminished. 2. Sen. Bennett (R-UT) did an excellent job questioning Gov. Davis about his handling of the situation, using quotes from California newspapers to make the case that Davis was slow to act. He also argued that the state had done a bad job as a power purchaser, contrasting the state's recent 8-year contract with Constellation for power at $150 peak and $59 off-peak with Enron's willingness last year to sell them power for five years at $50. The Republicans also pressed Davis on why he attacks out-of-state generators but is not nearly as vocal about California munis who charged even more. Davis said they should make refunds, too. 3. While not saying Enron by name, Gov. Davis did make a comment about companies with ""trading floors that compete with the New York Stock Exchange with meteorologists and very talented people"" who might have the ability to find loopholes in the new order. He said this in answer to a question about what FERC needed to do now that the new order was issued, and he said ""watch out for manipulation"" by those subject to the order. 4. Sen. Thompson pressed Washington State AG Gregoire about why she appeared to be investigating out-of-state suppliers even though they had a small percentage of the market in her state, with lots of document requests and other investigative action, while not doing the same to others. During that exchange either Thompson or the AG (I think it was the AG) said Enron had over $1 billion in sales to Washington State. Enron was not on the list of companies Thompson or the AG said were subject to her information demands. She said she would be expanding her inquiry, though. Highlights and Analysis 1. As started at yesterday's Senate Energy hearing, the mantra from the Western Democrats was: we want our money back. Chairman Lieberman and others pressed FERC about how California could get refunds and the same in other Western states, particularly Oregon and Washington. Chairman Hebert said that the settlement conference process would allow all parties to raise all issues, including refunds in California and outside California. He said that the conference could include issues that the commission could not act on itself, including refunds not otherwise allowed under the Federal Power Act. Chairman Lieberman vowed to keep the committee active in overseeing FERC's activities in implementing the new order, particularly as it relates to refunds. While he acknowledged that new legislation could not apply to pending cases, he seemed inclined to pursue legislation to repeal the 60 day delay in the Federal Power Act relating to refunds. 2. Commissioner Wood spoke of the need to increase the penalities and enforcement tools available to the commission, including the ability to order short suspensions of authority for regulated entities to transact business, treble damages, and other administrative penalties. There was also discussion among the committee and commissioners about beefing up FERC's market monitoring capabilities so that it acted more like the SEC, FCC and FTC than it has in the past. 3. The Democrats on the committee and among the witnesses said that FERC's latest order is a step in the right direction. None of them called for legislative action on price caps as proposed by Sens. Feinstein and Smith. Sen. Murkowski had done a good job of taking the wind out of the legislated price cap sails by saying at the start of the hearing when he testified that the bill's sponsors had pulled back from swift action when they spoke at yesterday's hearing. Davis did say the still thinks that cost-based rates are better, but he said the new order is ""some price relief"" and that it corrected the mistakes in the April order. 4. There was some discussion of natural gas again. Davis said that FERC should now turn its attention to natural gas. He said that El Paso controlled too much of the capacity until recently. He called on FERC to enforce laws against price manipulation. (Note: we have had several back channel reports that the Lieberman committee intends to look into the El Paso and Williams cases now at FERC about alleged affiliate issues.) 5. There was some discussion of the termination of the new FERC order. Lieberman pressed several witnesses about whether Sept. 2002 is too soon. Davis said it was and that they needed at least until the end of 2002 if not more time and that order should apply until California has enough new generation in place. Hebert did not back down when pressed by Lieberman later in the hearing, saying there needs to be a deadline to get action on new supplies, however he and the others basically said they would revisit the issue if events warrant. 6. Several times, Sen. Lieberman and others said they generally support deregulation, but that the effort to get more states to do so will never happen if the price situation is not brought under control and public confidence restored. 7. Gov. Davis did throw a few kind words toward Pres. Bush and Pat Wood, saying that each was open to doing more about the high cost of natural gas to California, including the possible reimposition of rate regulation of transportation to California. He said he liked Pat Wood and he noted that FERC did not take serious price mitigation action until the two new Bush appointees were on the commission. 8. Lieberman asked the Washington State AG whether the Justice Dept. or the FTC were doing anything to address high energy prices. She said not to her knowledge even though she has asked them to do so. We can expect a Lieberman, et al request for Justice and FTC involvement going forward, I suspect. 9. While Chairman Lieberman's tone and closing comments were in the nature of his normal thoughtful tone, it is clear that he and others see this as a major issue for them to ride. He commended FERC at the end of the hearing for doing their best, but pledged he would stay involved, closing the session with a smile and the words ""see you soon.""

Subject:: RE: Important - CPUC Motion - Confidential Attorney Client Privil
 ege and Work Product
Body:: I just spoke with Mary to make sure we have the same information. Here are the facts we have so far. On November 4th, the CPUC filed a motion with FERC to adopt the form of protective order that the CPUC entered, to compel the production of documents and to shorten time to answer. According to Exhibit B (read to me by Nancy Pickover at Bracewell) the following CPUC moved against the following entities: AES, Williams, Duke, Dynegy, Reliant and Southern. Enron entities were NOT named in exhibit B. This is not to say that we could not be easily added to the group. While the motion reads as if the CPUC was moving against everybody, in fact, in footnote 2 they state they are only moving against the entities named in Exhibit B. We will have Exhibit B in hand first thing tomorrow via FEDEX to confirm this. To repeat, Enron is not named yet.

Given the timing, we should discuss this on our conference call scheduled for tomorrow. They request that we be required: to answer their motion on Thursday, to provide the information within 5 working days of a FERC ordering production, and to provide of P&L information and spread sheets detailing our deals, specifically delivery point, delivery date, counterparty, volume and price. We may not have a problem providing this information for use by FERC in its proceeding subject to a confidentiality agreement but I think we would oppose their requests for: the information to be provided for ""government eyes only"" - this would prohibit EPMI from defending itself vis-a-vis other market participants. a FERC confidentiality order that would could allow FERC to ""share"" this information with the CPUC (for purposes of the PUC's OII proceeding) pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 824h(c). 16 USC 824g(c) requires the Commission to make information available to state commissions as may be of assistance in state regulation of public utilities. We should argue that 16 USC 824h(c) does not apply here given that we are not a public utility nor does the PUC regulate how much market power wholesale marketers exercise or the level of market power mitigation (these are the bases the PUC provides for explaining why it should have this information.) the above contractual information to allow them to analyze the competitiveness of the forward market to evaluate the wisdom of the Commission's decision to allow the UDC's ""unfettered access"" to the forwards market. This argument is unpersuasive given that the CPUC can get information about the competitiveness of the forward markets from the Wall Street Journal's listing of NYMEX prices.

Subject:: Re: BLM/Forest Service Right-of-Way Update
Body:: Preliminary congratulations!. Looks like a good plan. Keep me posted. Stephen D Burns@ENRON 07/19/2000 01:47 AM To: Richard Shapiro/HOU/EES@EES, James D Steffes/HOU/EES@EES cc: Scott Bolton/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Joe Hillings/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Chris Long/Corp/Enron@ENRON (bcc: Steven J Kean/HOU/EES) Subject: BLM/Forest Service Right-of-Way Update The Senate voted on the Interior Appropriations Bill late yesterday. Our amendment passed, which prevents either BLM or the Forest Service from enacting new fiber optic federal lands rights-of-way policies. The BLM made a last ditch effort to defeat this in the Senate, but we had reached key Senators and staff and they got nowhere. Action now moves to Conference, which for us means a focus on the House Conference members. Scott and I will spend the next 2 days meeting with the key Republicans in the House. We've already recruited the important Democrats. Interior Approps Subcommittee Chairman Regula remains opposed, at least publicly, but we think we can get other Members to swing him. We trust he'll come up with a sensible, face saving compromise on his own, eg, formally beginning a review process with his Subcommittee having oversight -- at this point, our language literally forbids BLM or Forest Service from even meeting to discuss the issue. We continue, though, on several other fronts: 1. We have the New Dems writing OMB on the issue and several Senators and Congressmen writing BLM and USFS 2. We've increased the pressure on the White House, and are letting them know through very senior back door channels that in our opinion, BLM/Forest Service have not gotten the message. Our position is that we'll be satisfied that they've changed their evil ways when the new assessment on the Mt. Hood EBS build is retracted. 3. We're preparing both Senate and House authorizing Committees for the longer-term issue next session. We have no trouble finding champtions eager to own the issue 4. We're engaging the Western Caucus for same 5. Our adhoc coalition continues to grow in numbers and clout with over 20 companies and associations now actively engaged. Enron chairs this initiative, with a tangible side benefit being much increased visibility and stature as a serious communications player. 6. Scott is successfully engaging state and local officials to weigh in from the end-user perspective BLM is on the retreat and has asked for a meeting, which we've refused. We don't think they've given up though, and it's likely an issue of pride at this point. So until the Approps process concludes we're continuing with the full court press. Steve

Greg Piper has informed me that PGE is of the opinion that we cannot even have NEPCO participate in the bid because PGE does not think that would be able to get by the regulators. Before accepting this as fact, can you confirm that we can not even participate in the bid process because NEPCO is an affiliate of Enron. It seems that the best interest of the rate payers is in getting a winning competitive bid. Are affiliates precluded from competitive bids in this process? Again, I don't want to accept a no without insuring that it's absolutely necessary. Thanks for your help. LI71299

The RED Index, which is the only known tool that objectively ranks states by 22 attributes on how they are restructuring their power markets, today released the U.S. rankings for all 50 states and the District of Columbia, in a 187 page report. Key results included: 1. Pennsylvania 66 2. Texas 65 3. New York 64 4. Maine 62 17. California 34 ""These numbers underscore the importance of building a healthy foundation on which electric competition can grow,"" said Ken Malloy, CEO of the Center. ""While California's crisis has brought a lot of positive attention to Pennsylvania's model, many customers in the Keystone State are returning to their original utility suppliers. It underscores how important it is to put the right fundamentals in place if consumers and suppliers are to benefit over the long haul,"" Malloy said. In rankings that included all of North America, the province of Alberta actually would rank above all the states with a score of 68. The mid-year RED Index also found that 62% of states expressing an opinion indicated that their commission is not ""less likely to take action on energy restructuring as a result of the California crisis."" CAEM is an independent, nonprofit, think tank based in Washington, DC whose mission is to promote an effective transition from the monopoly to the competitive model of regulation. For information about obtaining a copy of the RED Index, go to www.caem.org.

Since we couldn't locate a speaker to address the question of how Enron, now larger and more corporate than in the past, can continue to attract the best, the brightest (and the oddest?), I have asked Pankaj to give a brief talk about what the literature generated by his colleagues has to tell us on this subject. 5. I couldn't get anyone on the question, although I am still trying. I assume you folks will brief us on California and the national energy supply picture. Have we heard from the author of ""When Genius Fails""?

Therein lies the dark side of the vice president's brand of populism. The power subsidy proposal was drafted by a Washington energy consultant who is one of Gore's closest advisers on the environment. One of the major beneficiaries of the plan would be a power company notorious for polluting the atmosphere. To close the circle, the company has used the Gore adviser as a paid consultant. In polishing up his energy program, Gore played a variation on his Los Angeles acceptance speech's populistic attack on certain categories of business that have broken no law. This time, the target was the energy industry (""Big Oil""), assailed for benefitting from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' manipulation of oil prices. But Gore is no across-the-board enemy of corporate America. He always takes care of friends. While positioning himself as the foe of Big Oil, he emerges as the friend of Big Power. In that category is American Electric Power, based in Columbus, Ohio, and one of the Midwest's biggest supplier of coal-generated power. AEP, sued by the Environmental Protection Agency last year for alleged violation of the Clear Air Act, is widely viewed as a pariah by the environmentalist movement. It is accused of running one of the dirtiest operations to generate power. AEP frequently has paid for advice from environmental advocate Kathleen A. McGinty, who has an unusual resume indeed. As senior legislative assistant for energy and environmental policy to then-Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, she quickly gained a reputation on Capitol Hill as a passionate advocate for global climate control. Gore picked her for Clinton administration posts, enabling her to affect national policy in a major way. In 1993, she was named to head the new White House Office on Environmental Policy. In 1996, she was promoted to head the Council on Environmental Quality and became a leader in trying to sell to America the massively unpopular 1997 Gore-promoted Kyoto Treaty (never considered by the Senate) to slash energy consumption. Last year, McGinty emerged as a consultant with the law and lobbying firm of Troutman Sanders. There, she has been engaged in an interesting balancing act. On the one hand, she advised AEP and the Atlanta-based Southern Co., another power giant. On the other, she moonlighted for Gore in drafting the June 27 energy plan. Since July, she has been working full time for the Democratic National Committee. Gore's plan promises to ""clean up the nation's aging power plants by using market-based enforcement and comprehensive standards to reduce pollution and increase efficiency."" It offers ""a menu of financial mechanisms"" to ""those power plants and industries that come forward with projects that promise to dramatically reduce climate and health-threatening pollution."" That means a big subsidy for electric power companies to help them clean up their plants. According to congressional energy sources, AEP would receive millions of dollars to get right environmentally. Gore always has shown ability to reward individual corporate friends while castigating big business as predators. I previously reported that he had supported permission for deep oil and gas drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, desired only by Occidental Petroleum Corp., the source of much of his family's wealth. But federal help for Occidental and American Power and the potential for conflicts of interest fly beneath the radar in a capital where the hands of neither political party are clean. It is possible for Gore's diluted brand of populism to flourish because it is the way Washington works.

Ordinarily, I would be happy to participate. However, my wife is scheduled to have hip surgery (#2) on October 1. Judging from the last time she went through this I will have to stay around until she is out of the hospital and settled back at home. Accordingly, I am not planning any travel before October 10. Too bad. On another matter, can you ask someone in your energy services company to get in touch with me? I would like to set something up with MIT's executive VP in charge of the business side of running MIT, including energy purchases and management. We have a 22 MW cogenerator, buy gas and electricity at wholesale and use lots of heating and cooling on an ever growing campus with 8,000 students, as many employees, many computer facilities and laboratories. I'm sure that we can do it more efficiently and I have been encouraging the management to look for opportunities to out-source some or all of these activities. I would like to put them in touch with someone at Enron. Thanks Paul Professor Paul L.

Subject:: EPSA/EEI on Reliability
Body:: This follows up on Rick's inquiry late last week on the talks between EPSA and EEI on reliability. Yesterday I spoke with Mark Bennett and Donn Salvosa of the EPSA staff. Mark did the talking. The upshot is that EPSA and EEI are meeting to see if they can't agree on reliability legislation. EEI is working off of the NERC draft and has sent a version to EPSA dated 9/14 (see attached) that was the basis for last Thursday's meeting. EPSA is now doing some drafting of its own. I need to read the 9/14 draft, but the fact that they are working off of the old NERC language is of considerable concern. EPSA staff emphasizes the value of having EEI off the NERC reservation (which is good in terms of showing that there is NERC ""consensus""), but I think EPSA staff may be ""too flexible"" in how they are approaching it. I reminded them of our position and concerns and of Jim's prepared statement on EPSA's behalf filed for the Sept. 11 Barton hearing. EPSA staff claims that other EPSA members are OK with them embarking on this project. It is not clear if this effort will succeed. EPSA staff said EEI's board insists on having engineers do reliability, which is objectionable to EPSA. EPSA staff seems to think that some type of reliablity SRO is inevitable and that it is wise to get the best one they can. I will check with some other EPSA members.

By Thomas Buckley The Press-Enterprise LAKE ELSINORE A new group has raised its objections to Lake Elsinore's proposed hydroelectric plant and the power lines that might carry its electricity to San Diego County. On Thursday, the Elsinore Valley Municipal Water District board set aside for further study later this month a motion by Director Gary Kelley to ensure that both the lines and the actual power plant that make up a $450 million proposal from Enron North America proceed together. But residents of La Cresta, a mountaintop community near where the lines might run, did not care whether the plant and lines happened together. Many of them do not want the lines to be there at all. ""We are resolved to keep power lines out of the Cleveland National Forest and the San Mateo Wilderness Area,"" said La Cresta resident Bill Stockmar. ""Our constituents and the local residents impacted by the proposed project are outraged and respectfully demand immediate intervention to stop this project at the planning level."" As it stands now, the power lines from the hydroelectric plant would run from Temescal Canyon to Camp Pendleton along the ridge line of the Elsinore Mountains just west of the lake. Those lines could run in a narrow strip of forest land just west of the La Cresta community. Enron project manager Rob Bakondy said the final determination of where the lines might run is not set, but he said the power lines could be built at least a year before the plant itself. Besides serving the hydroelectric plant, the power lines could be used to replace lines San Diego Gas and Electric wants to build through Murrieta and Temecula to bring power to San Diego. The water district also announced it is considering financing and building the lines itself. District General Manager John Rossi said Wednesday that it was too early to say exactly how the lines would be built, but that the district's building or owning the lines, or both, in cooperation with Enron is ""one possibility."" Board President Kris Anderson said it is too early to tell whether it would benefit the district to become so directly involved in the project. But he said the district would be able to borrow the approximately $50 million needed to build the lines at a lower interest rate than a private company could get. That difference, Anderson said, could mean extra dollars for the district. How Governor Davis' proposal to purchase thousands of miles of transmission lines from the ailing utilities will affect the project is not yet clear, said Enron spokeswoman Kathy Russeth. The timing of the construction of the project, if it is approved by state and federal regulators, will not be finally known until a contract between Enron and the water district has been agreed upon. That is expected to happen by the end of May. GOP in a fix over power crisis Leaders seek solutions that won't undercut past support for deregulation By Daniel Borenstein TIMES POLITICAL EDITOR California Republican Party leaders are trying desperately to politicize the state's electricity crisis by blaming Gray Davis, but it seems that the harder they try the more popular the Democratic governor becomes. The latest GOP push will come today when party leaders, meeting in Sacramento for the start of their three-day state convention, hold a hastily organized workshop on energy. ""We should be explaining to California that Gray Davis was asleep at the switch last year,"" said one of the scheduled speakers, Republican strategist Dan Schnur. ""But that message can only work if it's coupled with a proposal for an alternative solution."" So far, that hasn't happened. For all the complaints about Davis, Republicans are moving even slower. Looking to 2002, when Davis will stand for re-election, the GOP has run radio ads attacking the governor for delays. But the party has yet to distinguish itself with a solid plan of its own. ""If Republicans are able in the next couple of months to articulate a clear plan, which is different from the Democratic plan, yes, we can use it as a political message,"" said Stuart DeVeaux, spokesman for the California Republican Party. ""Are Republicans in Sacramento going to come up with a plan that articulates a future for our energy problem? I'm not telling you it's going to be revealed this weekend. It's my hope it will be articulated this weekend."" Republicans are caught in an ideological quagmire. Pushing for re-regulation of electricity conflicts with the party's basic tenet of less government interference. Conversely, arguing for full deregulation puts Republicans at odds with a solid majority of Californians. A Los Angeles Times poll taken Feb. 14-15 found that 60 percent of Californians want to go back to a regulated electricity industry, while 25 percent are opposed. The GOP problem is exacerbated because there is no easy policy solution to the energy mess, said Jack Pitney, government professor at Claremont McKenna College. ""It's difficult to see how we get out of this situation without considerable cost. If there were a silver bullet, somebody would have found it by now."" Republicans have attacked Davis for his plan to buy power lines from private utilities. ""Everybody agrees there's $1 billion or $2 billion in deferred maintenance,"" said GOP consultant Sal Russo, another speaker at the party's convention today. ""We need to be in this business like a hole in the head."" But the Times poll found that Californians, by a 52-36 margin, favor the idea. Moreover, Davis' job approval rating has climbed this year. In January, 49 percent approved and 25 percent disapproved. In February, it was up to 57-26. Californians give Davis better marks for handling the electricity crisis than they give President Bush. Republicans are going to have difficult time laying the political blame on Davis. ""It's 'Murder on the Orient Express.' Everybody did it,"" Pitney said. ""Although you can make a case that Davis was slow in reacting, no one can seriously pin him with the primary blame for the problem."" The deregulation bill passed the Legislature in 1996 with the strong support of both parties and a Republican governor, Pete Wilson. Senate Minority Leader Jim Brulte, R-Rancho Cucamonga, is considered one of the Republican Party's top strategists. He was also one of the leading proponents of the deregulation bill. For all of those reasons, Garry South, Davis' political strategist, said he does not fear a GOP attack on electricity. ""If the Republicans want to get into a full-out firefight over how this mess came about, I'm more than willing to play. They don't have a very good story to tell."" For now, Davis' political strength is stable. But the 2002 primary elections are still more than a year away, and the general election is a political eternity from now. ""If this isn't resolved, there is nothing to guarantee that there won't be a voter backlash against the government,"" said political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe. ""And right now the government in California is the Democratic Party."" That's the message the Republicans want to drive home. But if they can't come up with their own alternative, they might have a hard time playing the blame game. Davis says state has tentative deal for Edison grid Updated: Feb. 23, 2001 - 4:42 p.m. LOS ANGELES -- After a week of intense closed-door negotiations with utility representatives, Gov. Gray Davis said Friday he had reached an ""agreement in principle"" with Southern California Edison to buy the utility's power lines for an estimated $2.7 billion. The deal also requires Edison International, the parent company of Edison, to sell cheap power to the state for a decade. ""This is the framework of a good, balanced deal,"" Davis said. ""It's not a final deal. There's a lot of work to be done, But we're making progress."" The governor said he did not expect customer rates to increase as a result of the deal. Edison did not immediately return calls seeking comment. The state has been in talks for a week to buy a total of 26,000 miles of transmission lines from Edison, Pacific Gas and Electric and Sempra Energy, which operates San Diego Gas & Electric. The total cost of the lines could range from $4.5 billion to $7 billion. The effort is intended to help restore the financial health of the state's two largest utilities, PG&E and Edison, both of which are near bankruptcy. The $2.7 billion price for the Edison lines amounts to 2.3 times the estimated book value, Davis said. The utilities say they have lost nearly $13 billion since June, trapped between soaring wholesale power prices and state-imposed rate caps for consumers. The tentative plan announced by Davis would allow Edison to issue bonds for a substantial portion of its losses. Davis said the state is making good progress in its talks with Sempra and ""some progress"" with PG&E. Thursday, Davis said he will not sign off on any grid buyout without all three utilities' participation. ""I do not believe we can make a satisfactory arrangement without 60 percent of the transmission grid, and that would require cooperation with PG&E,"" he said Friday. PG&E spokesman Ron Low said Thursday night that talks had ended with no resolution that day. ""These are complicated problems that will not be solved overnight,"" Low said. ""There are clearly some issues where we are very far apart."" Still, PG&E chief executive officer Robert Glynn Jr. said Friday the meeting with Davis was a ""milestone in the resolution of California's energy crisis"" and said he was willing to meet further to discuss the utility's proposal. ""Each utility's issues and opportunities in this crisis are different, and we believe that PG&E has proposed a detailed solution that balances ratepayer and shareholder interests,"" Glynn said in a statement issued Friday before the governor's news conference. The company said it would have no further comment. The tentative agreement also calls for: Edison parent Edison International to make payments to the utility of about $420 million. Edison International to commit the entire output of its Sunrise Mission power project at low, cost-based rates for 10 years. Davis said that arrangement could save ratepayers $500 million over the next two years. Edison to provide cost-based rates from generating plants it owns for another 10 years. Edison to drop its lawsuit against the California Public Utilities Commission claiming that imposed rate caps were illegal under federal law. ""This entire transaction, which I believe is fair and balanced for both sides, will be accomplished within the existing rate structure,"" Davis said. ""We will not be asking any more of consumers to allow this transaction to come to pass."" Davis said negotiations will continue in the coming days. Consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield called the governor's plan ""an outrageous giveaway"" and predicted that if lawmakers didn't halt it, voters would revolt. ""The most outrageous part of this isn't even paying 2.3 times what the lines are worth, but then allowing the parent companies that siphoned off billions of dollars to pay only the tax payment they already owe,"" Rosenfield said. The Public Utilities Commission already regulates how much the utilities can charge for power their own plants generate, Rosenfield said. --By Leslie Gornstein, Associated Press Writer - Utilities Search for Long-Term Fix During Breather State purchase of power lines under discussion Friday,?February 23, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle Sacramento -- A break in the weather and a break in the energy crisis coincided yesterday, as California enjoyed its first day in more than a month without a power alert. With the short-term picture for power improving, representatives of the state's three troubled utilities met separately with Gov. Gray Davis and his staff to work on a longer-range fix for the power crisis that would include state purchase of the firms' transmission lines. Trouble loomed in at least one set of talks, however, as Pacific Gas and Electric Co. said it was ""very far"" from reaching a deal. The California Independent System Operator, which coordinates the flow of electricity through the state's power grid, removed all power alerts at about 9 a.m. yesterday. Spokeswoman Lorie O'Donley said that with springtime approaching and weather improving, and with some power plants coming back to full output from maintenance, the overall picture is brightening. ""We're optimistic,"" she said. ""We're coming into the spring season, the majority of generators have had their maintenance completed. But everything is dependent on the weather and temperature."" The last day California had no power alerts was Jan. 13. Since then, there have been two days of rolling blackouts in Northern California and many other days of Stage 3 alerts -- when power reserves dip below 1.5 percent of available capacity. The mildest alert, Stage 1, is declared when reserves are between 5 and 7 percent of capacity. The supply of power has been helped by warmer temperatures in other Western states, cutting demand there, and by an increase in generators on line in California, O'Donley said. Last week, when the state was still in Stage 3 alerts, 10,500 megawatts were offline in California. Yesterday, there were 8,200 megawatts offline, a difference that provides enough power for a couple million homes. O'Donley warned that the supply picture in California is still tight, and conservation still necessary. But the focus of attention was turning to Sacramento and Davis' talks with the utilities. Davis announced a plan last week for the state to purchase 26,000 miles of utility-owned transmission lines in exchange for backing bonds that allow the utilities to repay the almost $13 billion in debt they say they owe. While Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric have indicated willingness to sell their lines, PG&E has refused to comment on the proposal. It is not clear if PG&E is unwilling to sell or simply trying to strike a harder bargain. The utility had accumulated more debt than its Southern California counterparts, and also owns the largest part of the transmission line grid. Talks between Davis' staff and PG&E did not start until late yesterday afternoon, and indications were that they were more difficult than negotiations involving the other two utilities. ""They're just on a different page,"" Michael Peevey, the former Edison president who is Davis' chief negotiator, told Bloomberg News. PG&E spokesman Ron Low said, ""These are difficult problems that cannot be solved overnight. There are clearly some areas where we are very far apart."" Davis hopes to make an announcement with at least one of the utilities before leaving today for the four-day National Governors Association meeting in Washington, D.C. The union that represents some 11,000 PG&E employees, meanwhile, called on Davis to negotiate state ownership of two power plants under construction in which PG&E holds large stakes. Jack McNally, business manager of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 1245, in Walnut Creek told Davis in a letter that a transmission line takeover would be a ""grand experiment"" fraught with danger. Acquiring the two prospective power plants, in Kern and San Diego counties, would do more to address energy shortages than taking over transmission lines that need hundreds of millions of dollars in maintenance, union officials said. Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio countered that state acquisition of transmission lines ""would not affect one union job,"" as the state would simply lease the grid back to the utilities. Maviglio predicted union jobs would increase with investment in new capacity and system upgrades. Chronicle staff writers Patrick Hoge and Robert Salladay contributed to this report. State's energy price tag increases Published Friday, Feb. 23, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News BY DION NISSENBAUM Mercury News Sacramento Bureau SACRAMENTO -- California's energy crisis took another big bite out of the state budget Thursday when finance aides to Gov. Gray Davis announced that the cost of buying energy may top $3 billion by mid-March. In a move that raised new alarms for lawmakers, the governor's finance team for the third time this month asked for $500 million to buy electricity in the coming weeks while Davis tries to work out a deal to bail out the state's near-bankrupt utilities. That, combined with money spent last month to buy energy, could drain the state coffers of $3 billion by St. Patrick's Day. The request for more cash came on the same day that California spent its first day in weeks without an official energy emergency and Davis held critical talks with the heads of Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. The talks are aimed at rescuing the two companies and Southern California Edison from financial collapse. While Davis had expressed hope last week of working out a deal by today, sources said that an agreement still remains elusive. Until a compromise can be hammered out, the state is being forced to pay upward of $50 million a day from the general fund to buy electricity. State leaders expect that the money will eventually be repaid to the general fund under a $10 billion bond package. But lawmakers are growing increasingly concerned about the short-term impact on the state fiscal plan. Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San Francisco, said the latest request for more money could create ``greater concern and anxiety'' among lawmakers and added that the energy crisis was going to make it harder to fund other programs, such as support for abused children. ``It's going to be a bleak year for other budget priorities,'' said Migden, who is chairwoman of the powerful Assembly Appropriations Committee. Earlier this week, the state's independent financial analyst warned that the energy crisis could eat into state money the governor wants to spend on other things such as the environment and public safety. While lawmakers have so far bitten their tongues about the growing power price tag, Migden said the Legislature might be hesitant to allow the costs to go any higher. ``I can't imagine another infusion after this being required,'' Migden said. ``I think this has to be the last request because we're going to hit fundamental core programs.'' Waiting for bailout plan California stepped in to buy the energy last month after PG&E and Southern California Edison lost the financial wherewithal to do it themselves. At the time, state leaders reluctantly agreed to buy the energy for a short period of time as part of a larger plan for California to sign long-term contracts with power generators. But those negotiations have failed to produce much energy so far, and Davis said earlier this week that the power producers are hesitant to sign any deals until California agrees to a bailout plan for the utilities. On Thursday, one power producer -- Williams Cos. -- announced that it had signed a 10-year contract with the state to provide up to 1,400 megawatts of power to California. In a bid to work out the bailout plan, Davis and his advisers met Thursday and were to meet again today with top executives from all three electric utilities in financial trouble. The Democratic governor wants to buy 26,000 miles of high voltage transmission lines owned by the three companies in exchange for helping the utilities pay off $13 billion in debts. The utilities are being asked to protect thousands of acres of wilderness lands they own, hang onto power plants that provide the state with its cheapest electricity, and drop explosive lawsuits that could allow the companies to dramatically raise customer rates. But sources said talks have bogged down on the transmission line deal, which PG&E has been reluctant to accept. Alternative energy helps out While talks slogged along in the governor's office, state lawmakers announced that another key piece of the puzzle needed to solve the energy crisis was falling into place. State Sen. Jim Battin, R-Palm Desert, and Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Santa Cruz, said that alternative energy producers had agreed to dramatically lower their prices in a deal that could save California $3 billion to $4 billion. Those energy producers, nearly 700 wind, solar and natural gas-fired plants, provide about a third of the state's energy. Paying for power still a big question POWER CRISIS PG&E doesn't like the plan the PUC proposed to collect electricity costs By Mike Taugher TIMES STAFF WRITER Three weeks after Gov. Gray Davis signed into law the state's centerpiece for stabilizing energy costs, big differences remain over how the solutions will be implemented and who will pay for them. The plan, outlined in legislation known as AB1X, was intended first to stop the financial bleeding of California's two largest utilities by asking the state to buy enough unsecured power to keep the lights on. Next, the state would enter long-term contracts for less expensive power that would eventually lessen the need for more costly, last-minute electricity. But the state has balked at buying the entire portfolio of last-minute electricity that is needed, and a disagreement emerged Thursday over what portion of consumers' bills should be used to reimburse state coffers. Meanwhile, progress on completing contracts has been slow, although two were signed Thursday. A spokesman for Davis said more contracts for relatively low-cost power would be signed once the state bought the utilities' transmission lines and other assets, because then the utilities could pay their past-due bills. The governor said last week that he expected a deal with the utilities by today, but that might not happen. ""Clearly, there's been challenges getting long-term contracts, but we've turned the corner,"" said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio. ""We've got three in the bank and 10 more once we get these deals (with the utilities) done."" Also Thursday, the Public Utilities Commission was poised to allow the state to collect the entire amount that customers pay specifically for electricity. But Pacific Gas & Electric Co. said it is entitled to deduct other costs from customers' payments before reimbursing the state. That would reduce payments from PG&E to the state by about half, according to the company. The PUC proposal was in response to a request from the state Department of Water Resources that it be allowed to start collecting money so that energy companies would be more willing to sell power to the agency. The two Republican-appointed commissioners of the PUC blocked the move, which needed four of five commissioners' approval to reach the agenda. ""DWR's (action) is exacerbating a problem AB1X was meant to alleviate,"" said Commissioner Richard Bilas. ""It is pushing the utilities closer to bankruptcy."" PG&E spokesman John Nelson said the proposal brought by PUC President Loretta Lynch would have been unfair to the utilities because AB1X allows them to deduct expenses for buying electricity and generating energy at their own power plants before reimbursing the state. ""All of those costs need to be paid going forward. Otherwise, you still leave the utilities to bleed,"" Nelson said. That stance appeared to be at odds with the office of Assemblyman Fred Keeley, the Boulder Creek Democrat who wrote AB1X. ""For PG&E to think it can keep money for electrons it never even owned is astounding to us,"" said Guy Phillips, a Keeley aide. While nothing has gone smoothly, Phillips and others expressed optimism that the state's biggest effort to date to fix the energy crisis would work. ""We think those will be sorted out,"" said Phillips, who acknowledged there has been much confusion about what lawmakers intended in AB1X. For example, Keeley's office said lawmakers wanted the water resources agency to make up the entire amount of electricity that the state's two largest utilities had not secured ahead of time. The high cost of this last-minute electricity -- and the utilities' heavy reliance on it -- is what drove PG&E and Southern California Edison to the brink of bankruptcy. But the water agency has balked at buying electricity offered at prices it calls ""unreasonable."" While state officials have refused to say how much electricity it has left to utilities to purchase, the state is paying about $55 million a day to keep electricity flowing. And that amounts to about 90 percent of the electricity purchased on behalf of the utilities on the same day it is needed, according to Phillips. The state's reluctance to buy all of the so-called real-time electricity has led to fears that the utilities will continue to run up debt and that power companies will not collect money owed to them. That dispute has landed in federal court, where a Sacramento judge is forcing three major power suppliers and a marketing company to continue selling power in the state. If a settlement is not reached today, U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell is expected to decide whether to extend his order, to modify it or to drop it. Staff writer Andrew LaMar contributed to this story. Lowenthal returns utility money By Will Shuck From our Sacramento Bureau SACRAMENTO Assemblyman Alan Lowenthal, D-Long Beach, this week joined a small group of legislators who returned campaign contributions to California utility companies and other energy firms. He sent $5,000 back to Southern California Edison and $500 to Sempra Energy, parent company of Southern California Gas. It was a small portion of the more than Lowenthal $500,000 Lowenthal had raised in 2000 for his re-election campaign. He said he returned the money, as did nine other Assembly members, at the urging of the consumer advocacy group Global Exchange. ""We think it's fantastic that he has recognized that in the eyes of the public there is a very serious potential conflict of interest,"" said group spokeswoman Medea Benjamin. ""We applaud him for wanting to ensure the integrity of the legislative process."" While Benjamin says it's critical that lawmakers not be tainted by energy money during the state's power crisis, others wonder where the line should be drawn. ""In the real world of politics it costs money to run for office and you have to get that money somewhere,"" said Paul Schmidt, a political science professor at Cal State Long Beach. ""To say that you can only make decisions on things involving individuals that haven't given you any money would result in paralysis of government."" Benjamin and other consumer advocates say the power crisis calls for special consideration. ""There are not many cases in which they're actually voting whether a company will survive with billions of dollars of taxpayer money or go bankrupt, as they're doing with the utility companies,"" Benjamin said. Lowenthal agreed. ""I thought it was an appropriate request,"" he said. ""These are unique circumstances, and I just think it's in the public's best interest that I return that money."" Dan Walters: A power grab by politicians (Published Feb. 23, 2001) Slowly, but inexorably, control over the generation, acquisition and distribution of electric power in California is being shifted from professional utility managers and independent regulators into the hands of politicians. The 1996 utility ""deregulation"" scheme enacted by the Legislature was an initial foray into politicization. Legislation granting the governor more control over the makeup of the Public Utilities Commission was another. But the current power supply/price crisis has led to even more direct political influence over -- or interference with -- electric service. One hastily enacted bill, for example, gives the governor direct control of the now-misnamed ""Independent System Operator,"" which operates the statewide power grid. More political intrusion is in the works, from a state takeover of the intercity power transmission grid to the creation of a state power authority that would buy, generate and sell electricity directly. And while local public utilities function well, a state power agency might operate on the whims of professional politicians. The Legislature, for example, wants appointments to the board that would direct a state power authority, and big state power projects would be subject to the same kind of pork-barrel mentality that distorts other public works appropriations. Where power plants were to be built, or where high-voltage lines would be strung, might well depend on who could, and could not, bring political influence to bear, rather than what the system needed to work efficiently. Clues to the potential pitfalls of a state-operated power system are found in the approaches of Capitol politicians to the current crisis. There is, for example, the unspoken goal of avoiding big power rate boosts until after the November 2002 election -- even if it means running up billions of dollars in debts to do it. Would future rates charged by a state power authority be raised or lowered to enhance the prospects of the dominant party or an incumbent governor? There's no evidence in past performances to indicate they wouldn't be. And then there's the knotty question of who would get vital power supplies in the event of shortages -- a situation that is already looming and could become worse in future months. Emergency legislation already gives the state the right to sell power as it pleases, without competitive bidding or even public notice. There's nothing, really, to prevent politically influential power customers such as big industrial enterprises from cutting their own supply deals with politically directed state officials. And whose juice would be cut off if shortages mean blackouts? Approximately 45 percent of current power customers are effectively exempt from rolling blackouts because they are connected to circuits (called ""blocks"") that also include vital services, such as hospitals, fire and police agencies, water supply systems and communications centers. The Capitol, not surprisingly, is in one of those noninterruptible blocks. With the threat of further blackouts looming, legislation is being drafted to designate which customers will suffer and which will not -- thus taking that authority out of the hands of utilities and regulators. And that, in turn, is generating pressure from lobbyists from all sorts of interest groups to place their clients on protected lists. Should farmers be cut off, or biotechnology facilities, or computer chip plants, or schools? When politicians control any process or system, one can be certain that they will always make expedient political decisions, regardless of the long-term or wider consequences. Thus, we may someday regret allowing the Capitol's self-serving politicians to get their hands on our electric power system. Discount Urged Near Power Plants Senator urges electricity rate break for neighbors of generators Friday,?February 23, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle As California officials propose building 32 new ""peaker"" power plants across the state by July, one legislator from plant-rich eastern Contra Costa County thinks residents should get a discount on their power bill for having a generator in their backyard. The proposed bill would provide a little payback for residents of state Sen. Tom Torlakson's district, which is home to a half-dozen plants and has three more in the construction pipeline. Under the bill introduced yesterday by Torlakson, D-Antioch, people living within a 20-mile circle around a power plant would receive a 20 percent discount on their electricity bill and be exempt from blackouts. The legislation was partially inspired by San Jose officials' rejecting a proposal to build a 600-megawatt power plant in the Coyote Valley, as well as Gov. Gray Davis' plan to build 5,000 megawatts of new generating capacity by July 1. ""It's a question of fairness,"" Torlakson said. ""People in communities who are shouldering the burden for having plants in their backyard should get some benefit from it."" Torlakson said consumers who lived in communities without plants could pick up the tab for the discounts. ""But the utilities would have to figure that out within their rate system,"" he said. A PG&E spokesman said yesterday that the company does not comment on pending legislation. While consumer advocates, environmentalists and power generators were lukewarm to the proposal yesterday, many admit that the state has not thought about how to -- of even if they have to -- offer communities a little incentive to approve a power plant within their borders. However, the state has allocated $30 million for plants that get online by July 1. ""As far as incentives, I'd think most communities would see the value of the employment they'd get and the increase to the tax base,"" said Larry Hamlin, the governor's recently appointed project manager for the plant-building campaign. A spokesman for California's Environmental Protection Agency, which permits plants, said the plan might be a ""worthwhile idea for making power plants more palatable to Californians."" Michael Shames, head of Utility Consumer Action Network in San Diego said the bill was attacking a ""not in my back yard"" problem that doesn't exist. ""Many San Diego communities are clamoring for plants in the hope that they would bring stability to the market,"" he said. James Peters of Mirent, the Atlanta-based company formerly known as Southern Energy, said the plan wouldn't encourage generators to build the number of plants needed to solve the energy crisis. Already, communities like Pittsburg have cut deals with power generators before letting them build. In exchange for letting the Calpine Corp. build two large plants in town, Pittsburg received the lifetime option to purchase 100 megawatts of power at below-market rates. Next week, a Pittsburg group is going to begin gathering signatures demanding that city leaders use the estimated 26 megawatts it would take to light residences and businesses to give local residents a break on bills. The group will hold an organizational meeting at 7 p.m. Tuesday at the Los Medanos Community Hospital, 2311 Loveridge Rd. in Pittsburg. At last, power alerts are lifted: Enjoy respite because crisis far from resolved, experts say By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer (Published Feb. 23, 2001) As oddly as it arrived, California's electric emergency lifted Thursday morning. At 9 a.m., the Independent System Operator, which controls most of California's grid, ended a Stage 1 alert. It was the first time since Jan. 13 that the state hadn't been under a power emergency, declared when low supplies threaten grid stability. The alerts included 32 straight days of Stage 3 emergencies, the black clouds that gather before rotating outages. The clouds cleared on a day when predicted peak use was low -- but not the lowest it has been for the last five weeks. Many power plants were back on line after repairs -- but more plants had been operating during at least one Stage 3 day. So what happened? A little luck, a little planning and maybe a little group psychology, said those who have closely watched recent gyrations of the state's electric roller coaster. ""It is a roll of the dice,"" said Gary Ackerman, head of the Western Power Trading Forum, which represents plant owners and marketers. ""If it continues for the next three or four weeks I wouldn't be too surprised. That'll be our respite. Enjoy it."" The end of a 40-day string of emergencies could mean a few more lights in store aisles or a little less worry about running an electric furnace. Some speculated it might also mean lower wholesale prices. But major changes are not likely in the steady rain of conservation calls that have fallen on Californians since the north state was twice plunged into rotating blackouts last month. ""I hope people don't just go back to wasteful ways,"" said Mike Florio of The Utility Reform Network, a consumer group. Now that the emergencies have dissipated, ""we don't have to talk about imposing hardships on people, but prudent use of energy is an idea we're going to have to live with for a long time,"" he said. At the ISO, longer days and slightly warmer weather was credited with decreasing peak demand for electricity. Supplies are up within the state, and power imports from the Pacific Northwest have risen significantly, said Jim Detmers, who manages grid operations. Plus, in one of the biggest changes, the state Department of Water Resources has begun getting more power supplies lined up at least a day in advance, he said. Since the department stepped in to buy power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities, it has often managed to line up about 70 percent to 75 percent of what the state needed to supplement utility-controlled supplies, according to Detmers. That meant grid operators had to scramble to buy the rest on very short notice. But starting last Friday, the state began to schedule about 90 percent of its purchases at least one day in advance. ""The operators are able to enter a day with a lot more confidence about being able to make it,"" Detmers said. ""You don't have to search to find those megawatts at the last minute."" Closely in sync with increased purchases by the state, the ISO dropped from a Stage 3 emergency to Stage 2 on Friday, and then slid to a Stage 1 Wednesday. The stages are based on how much reserve power is left for unexpected crises; a Stage 3 is declared when reserves slip below 1.5 percent. For their part, power buyers at the water resources department weren't sure what has made the difference over the past few days. ""It's certainly not that people are lining up to sell us power at cheap prices,"" said Jim Spence, the department's director of emergency operations. ""We're just buying whatever we can, and it turned out that it was easier to make ends meet."" He said he couldn't make any prediction about how long that would last. The string of power emergencies has been unpredictable from the start, erupting in winter, when California's hunger for electricity traditionally declines and supplies are usually so flush that plants close for tune-ups. Consumer advocates and power traders blamed finances for the emergencies, rather than a fundamental lack of supply, as fears of utility bankruptcies triggered a descent into market chaos and high-stakes political maneuvering. But basic supply shortages are expected to move to the forefront by summer, when temperatures rise and demand soars. Meanwhile, the brief respite -- whatever the reason -- brought palpable relief to those charged with keeping the power grid stable. ""When we found out yesterday during the board meeting that we were only in Stage 1, we broke out in applause,"" said Florio, who sits on the five-member ISO board. The change also could be good news for consumers, who may one day be paying higher rates for the wholesale electricity now being purchased by the state. ""Getting out of a Stage 3 typically means prices are going to ease,"" Florio said. ""When you're even in a Stage 1, that's a signal to everybody, 'They're short, that means we can hold them up now.' "" Davis' deadlines on energy much easier set than met By Emily Bazar Bee Staff Writer (Published Feb. 23, 2001) Exactly one week ago, Gov. Gray Davis sounded hopeful, optimistic even, when he predicted that the state and its debt-ridden utilities would forge an agreement by today on a plan to save the companies from financial doom. Problem is, it won't work out that way. Negotiations between state officials and the investor-owned utilities have produced no comprehensive agreement to announce today. Davis' predictions during the energy crisis have been wrong before. For weeks, he has set deadlines for agreements and legislative action that haven't been met. On deadline days, even when there's little substantive progress to report, Davis often holds news conferences anyway -- many of them on Friday afternoons after financial markets close. The Democratic governor's office scheduled an ""announcement"" for today in Los Angeles, even though one utility representative said agreement is far away. Davis' actions have fueled speculation that he's trying to force consensus by setting artificial deadlines and putting a spin on the news, and tarnishing the state's credibility in the process. ""I can't see how you would negotiate such a complex deal, like the purchase of the transmission grid, in such a short period of time. It doesn't seem realistic,"" said Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, an association of wholesale generators. ""I guess the people I represent have turned it off. They have stopped listening. They hear it and say, 'OK, sure. Here's another photo op.' "" Last Friday, Davis told a gathering of reporters that state officials and the utilities would agree by today on a rescue plan for the utilities. ""I believe we'll have agreement before next week is out, on exactly what should go in a piece of legislation,"" he said at the time. ""And hopefully, that legislation will be passed by the end of the following week."" Legislative veterans said his comments were ill-advised and unrealistic. Davis met into the night Thursday with top officials of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., but no agrement was reached. ""These are complicated problems that will not be solved overnight,"" said PG&E spokesman Ron Low. ""On some issues, we are very far away from agreement."" Sources said PG&E has been unwilling to negotiate sale of its transmission lines, which Davis has said is a necessary component of a deal. More progress was reported with the two other near-bankrupt companies -- San Diego Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison -- although sources said talks with them were far from concluded. Davis has been setting specific deadlines for himself and the Legislature for months: In November, the governor promised to present a comprehensive ""plan"" by Dec. 1 to stave off a full-blown energy crisis, but ended up offering only a modest slate of proposals. Davis called Feb. 12 a ""drop dead"" date by which he hoped to cement a deal between lawmakers and the utilities. There's no deal yet. Davis told reporters that he and the state's legislative leaders would reach a ""consensus agreement"" on the proposal to take to utilities by last Friday. It didn't happen; he made the announcement alone. Leon Panetta, a White House chief of staff under former President Clinton, said it's important that the governor set deadlines because the nature of politics is to delay. However, he cautioned against missing deadlines. ""You have to be careful that you keep the deadlines you establish, because the more that you establish and not meet, the more that begins to lose its value as a political tool,"" Panetta said. The governor can't continue to indefinitely set deadlines without facing consequences, cautioned Steven Fetter, managing director of the Global Power Group at Fitch, a credit-rating agency based in New York. At some point, he warned, creditors and power suppliers may push the utilities into involuntary bankruptcy, which would trigger an official deadline that can't be ignored. The dispute would be tied up in court at a judge's discretion. ""Eventually, there is going to be a real deadline,"" Fetter said. ""The problem is it's probably not a deadline that will be set by Gov. Davis. It's a deadline that will be set by the banks and the (electricity) suppliers."" In several cases when deadlines haven't been met, Davis has held a news conference regardless, unveiling little new information and scant detail. On Jan. 26, for instance, the governor promoted the broad framework of a plan to save the utilities rather than a detailed plan that had been anticipated. One prong of the plan: ""Aggressively promote energy efficiency, conservation and demand reduction among consumers, businesses and public entities."" Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said that the governor continues to set deadlines because it's important to show that the state is making progress, particularly to Wall Street. He added that it's not the governor's fault the deadlines have been missed. ""Many of the dates have been blown away by factors no one has been able to foresee or have control over: court decisions, actions by creditors, weather, you name it,"" Maviglio said. ""The governor sets deadlines that continue to move the ball forward and he has been successful at doing that."" Many of these announcements came after 2 p.m. on Fridays, triggering suggestions that the governor has attempted to spin the facts and manipulate the markets. Timing announcements after the close of East Coast financial markets is commonly used by politicians who don't want to send stocks soaring or tumbling by making an announcement, Panetta said. ""You want people to evaluate what's happening so there isn't a panic reaction to a news flash going over the wire,"" he said. But market analysts say that ever since PG&E and Edison stocks plummeted in early January, the governor's statements haven't significantly affected their performance. ""There has been so much news that has been so negative for the companies that I don't think it makes much of a difference,"" said Ed Schuller, a senior vice president for the full-service brokerage firm Sutro & Co. ""It's beyond that point now."" GOP Sees Power Crisis as Davis' Achilles' Heel Republicans line up to run for governor Friday,?February 23, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, politically wounded by the state's power woes, has become the target of a growing pack of Republicans looking to turn him out of office. ""Four months ago, Davis looked on track to get re-elected by a voice vote,"" said Dan Schnur, a GOP strategist. ""But the energy crisis has exposed vulnerabilities that have encouraged others to look at the (2002 governor's) race."" The governor's backers, however, are confident California voters will recognize Davis is dealing with a problem that has been brewing for years, through previous Republican administrations. ""If the Republicans want to have a full-out firefight over who brought this (energy crisis) down, we're ready for it,"" said Garry South, the governor's top political adviser. ""It's a fight they can't win."" With the primary election still more than a year away, no one but Davis is a sure bet to leap into the contest, but at least three names will be circulating when California Republicans meet in Sacramento this weekend for their state convention. Secretary of State Bill Jones, Los Angeles investor Bill Simon Jr. and actor Arnold Schwarzenegger all have made noises about challenging Davis, but so far their incipient campaigns have been more talk than action. Simon's effort might be the farthest along, but he also has the longest way to travel. A political unknown, the 49-year-old Simon runs his family's investment company and has been active in a number of charitable organizations in Southern California. Simon, whose father was treasury secretary under President Richard Nixon, has brought in veteran GOP consultant Sal Russo to study a possible run for governor. ""Bill Simon feels we need a governor who's prepared to lead and not one who's focused on fund-raising or the next political office,"" Russo said in a jab at Davis. Simon was an assistant U.S. attorney in New York, but founded William E. Simon & Sons with his brother and late father in 1988. The $2 billion private investment firm owns a number of companies and has also invested heavily in South of Market real estate in San Francisco. Wealthy political outsiders don't have an enviable record in recent California elections. Republican Michael Huffington spent $29 million to lose a 1994 Senate race to Dianne Feinstein. Darrell Issa dropped around $13 million in a losing race for the 1998 GOP Senate nomination. Al Checchi spent about $38 million of his own money to lose the Democratic primary to Davis in 1998. While Simon likely would be spending plenty of his own money on a governor's bid, he's working to get outside support, both political and financial, before committing to the race, Russo said. With the state's problems mounting and the economy increasingly shaky, the time may be ripe for a political unknown, he added. ""When things start going bad, people are willing to look outside for a new face, someone who will get things done,"" Russo said. Jones is anything but a political outsider. A veteran legislator from the Fresno area, he is now serving his second and last term as California's secretary of state. He managed to hang onto his job during the GOP's 1998 electoral debacle, which cost the party every other constitutional office. While Jones has long talked about a run for governor, he's still playing coy. ""We have not made any decision and probably won't make one until early March,"" said Rob Lapsley, one of Jones' top advisers. ""Right now we're putting together information for Bill to make a decision."" While Jones' role as the state's top GOP officeholder makes him an obvious choice to challenge Davis, he's made a number of political enemies over the years, many of them in his own party. His surprise decision last year to switch his support from George W. Bush to Arizona Sen. John McCain in California's presidential primary won him no fans among Bush supporters and could hurt his attempts to raise money for a gubernatorial bid. Money is a major problem for Jones, who listed $118,000 in his campaign fund last month, compared with nearly $26 million for Davis. Some of his opponents have suggested that fund-raising woes may force Jones to run for an office other than governor. ""Right now, we're focused on the governor's race,"" Lapsley insisted. The real Republican wild card is Schwarzenegger, the movie action hero who would be instantly recognized by nearly every California voter. While Schwarzenegger's publicist told The Chronicle last month that he had no plans to get involved in next year's governor's race, the Austrian-born star was on the telephone to a Los Angeles Times columnist days later, talking about his love for politics and his political ambitions. Fame, however, has its drawbacks, as the 53-year-old Schwarzenegger has found. An article in Premiere magazine entitled ""Arnold the Barbarian"" accused him of groping women on movie sets and generally boorish behavior, while the supermarket tabloids have him on the cover this week, suggesting that his marriage to Maria Shriver is on the rocks. South, Davis' political adviser, gleefully sent copies of the Premiere article to reporters across the state, suggesting that ""the piece lays out a real 'touching' story -- if you get what I mean."" Whoever ends up with the GOP nomination still will face an uphill battle against Davis, a popular governor and a ""take no prisoners"" campaigner. ""I've been predicting since Day One that the GOP would find some moneybags candidate to throw against Gray,"" South said. ""That's why we've kept our political and fund-raising operation going since election day."" Pressure Is on Utilities to Accept Grid Sale Energy: Gov. Davis wants accord today, but Edison executive says company might prefer bankruptcy. By DAN MORAIN and NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writers ?????SACRAMENTO--His credibility at risk and California's energy future on the line, Gov. Gray Davis on Thursday turned up the heat on the state's utilities to accept today a series of tentative rescue accords that would put the companies' transmission systems into public hands. ?????How far the utilities are willing to bend to the governor's intensified pressure was unclear late Thursday. Given Davis' mandate, a top executive of Southern California Edison said his company is now being forced to seriously contemplate whether it might fare better in Bankruptcy Court. ?????""We are weighing two very unpalatable alternatives,"" he said. ?????Two alternatives facing the utilities are either to sell their electrical transmission systems to the state at a price they consider too low or gamble in Bankruptcy Court that they could hang onto their valuable assets. ?????After nearly a week of negotiations, Davis administration officials said they hoped to announce today a partial deal that would calm the utilities' jittery creditors and help subdue California's runaway electricity market. ?????State officials said Thursday they were close to agreements with Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric but remained at odds with the state's biggest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, which has balked at giving up its transmission grid. ?????""These are complex issues that cannot be resolved overnight,"" said PG&E spokesman Ron Lowe. ""There are clearly some areas where we are very far apart."" ?????On Thursday, Edison Chairman John Bryson conferred with members of his utility's board of directors. But by evening, the company's top executives still had not decided whether to acknowledge that an agreement is near. ?????Although the utility has begun to contemplate the protections of bankruptcy, it is unclear when, or if, such a dramatic action would occur. ?????Davis is believed to be offering roughly $7 billion for the utilities' transmission grids. The companies could use the cash to restructure their debt, which resulted from the utilities' inability to pass along their soaring wholesale electricity costs to ratepayers. ?????Davis has significant political and fiscal reasons for wanting to make an announcement today. He is scheduled to arrive in Washington for the National Governor's Assn. conference this weekend, meet with U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham on Sunday, and attend the Democratic Governors Assn. annual fund-raising dinner Monday night. ?????Davis, a prodigious fund-raiser, is chairman of the Democratic Governors Assn., and the dinner is expected to raise more than $5 million. Of that amount, Davis' political organization raised in excess of $1 million, said Garry South, his chief political advisor. ?????Any progress Davis can cite could help improve his national political standing. But his aides say it's especially important to be able to show at least a semblance of an agreement when he travels to New York on Wednesday to confer with Wall Street analysts. ?????On Thursday, those analysts reacted exuberantly to early hints from the governor's office that settlements with the utilities might be announced. ?????The recently anemic stocks of Edison International and PG&E Corp. soared on the New York Stock Exchange on a day when most utility stocks closed lower. ?????Edison jumped $1.50 per share, or 11.15%, to close at $14.95 while PG&E gained $1.49, or 11.41%, to $14.55 per share. ?????""That suggests that someone thinks something good is happening in Sacramento,"" said analyst James D. von Riesemann of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. ?????But some analysts fear investor enthusiasm might be hasty. ?????""I'm concerned that the governor's optimism may not coincide with all the parties at the table and it may not coincide with the Legislature,"" said Paul Patterson, utility analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. ?????Davis met Thursday with Steve Baum, chairman of Sempra, the parent company of SDG&E. Administration officials are confident that an agreement can be reached. But the San Diego company is the smallest of the state's three major private utilities, and its debt is far smaller--$605 million, compared to the combined $12.7 billion that Edison and PG&E say they have amassed. ?????""[Baum] is willing to listen,"" said Sempra spokesman Doug Kline. "" . . . We're on the record as stating that we are willing to consider the sale of those [transmission] assets if it helps solve the crisis."" ?????PG&E executives had been scheduled to start meeting with Davis at 11 a.m. Thursday. But in what was seen a slight against PG&E, Davis' aides did not summon negotiators for the Northern California utility, including company Chairman Robert Glynn, until after 3:30. ?????Although the parties continued to wrangle over details, there was progress Thursday on the sidelines. ?????State officials announced they had signed a long-term contract for a relatively small amount of electricity with a major energy supplier--an achievement that was perhaps more symbolic than substantive. ?????Tulsa-based Williams Cos. said it had agreed to a 10-year deal to sell power to the Department of Water Resources. By April, the company will provide at least 175 megawatts--enough electricity to supply 175,000 homes--at times of the day when demand for electricity soars. Such peak supplies will increase through next summer and reach 900 megawatts by 2006, according to Williams. ?????The agreement is only the second such long-term contract since Davis signed a bill Feb. 1 putting the Department of Water Resources into the power-buying business for many years to come. ?????At least 10 other power suppliers have reached understandings with the state, Davis said Wednesday. But those companies refuse to sign deals, the governor said, until the state finds a way to help California's two biggest utilities pay off their billion-dollar debts. ?????""As soon as we revitalize the utilities,"" the governor said, ""I think you'll see a lot of movement on long-term contracts."" ?????Another small but important piece of the state's energy plan emerged Thursday when legislation was introduced by Sen. Jim Battin (R-La Quinta) to slash the rates paid to alternative energy producers--a move expected to shave $3 billion or more in annual costs charged to the big private utilities. Reducing the amount paid to producers of renewable energy such as solar, wind and biomass power is considered a crucial step in keeping expected consumer rate hikes down. ?????And, after 40 days of dangerously low electricity supplies, the state got a reprieve Thursday morning when grid officials lifted the state's ""electrical emergency"" status for the first time since Jan. 13. ?????So far, the state has spent nearly $2 billion buying electricity on behalf of the utilities, according to the Department of Finance, which informed the Legislature on Thursday that it will release another $500 million for electricity purchases. --- ?????Times staff writers Nancy Rivera Brooks, Nancy Cleeland and Mitchell Landsberg in Los Angeles and Julie Tamaki and Jenifer Warren in Sacramento contributed to this story. Energy Firms Won't Pay All of Monster Debt PUC reverses, taxpayers could foot the bill Christian Berthelsen, Chronicle Staff Writer Friday,?February 23, 2001 Under a ruling yesterday by state regulators, California taxpayers could be on the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars in power purchases the state has made in behalf of two troubled utilities. The California Public Utilities Commission voted unanimously to absolve Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison of responsibility for any costs above the revenue they collect from ratepayers. The ruling reversed a position taken earlier by the commission, which had said the utilities were responsible for making up the difference between the state's costs and their own revenue. John Tremaine, a PG&E spokesman, said the funding needed to make up the difference could come in the form of a surcharge imposed on customers who use 130 percent of the baseline amount of electricity. That is one option under a bill passed last month by the Legislature, he said. But Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, said the governor does not believe the money will come from ratepayers' electric bills. The costs, Maviglio said, could be covered by the $10 billion bond measure the state recently issued to cover power purchases. As California tries to resolve its power crisis, state officials are working out the precise way that should be done. Under the state's deregulation plan approved in 1996, the utilities have been forced to absorb skyrocketing wholesale electricity costs while being prevented by law from passing the increases on to customers through higher rates. Since the California Department of Water Resources began buying power last month, details showing how it will be repaid, how much or by whom have not been established. Yesterday's PUC decision was an attempt to begin setting the repayment criteria. A precise accounting of how much money is at stake is impossible to determine at this point, officials said, because PG&E declines to release ratepayer revenue figures, and the state is refusing to say exactly how much it has spent buying power. Officials estimate the state will spend $2.3 billion by the beginning of March and Davis authorized the expenditure of $500 million more yesterday. The state's Department of Water Resources became the buyer of record on Jan. 17 when the two utilities' credit was so damaged that they were no longer able to buy power. Both utilities had opposed the commission's previous position that they be responsible for all power costs. The PUC's shift yesterday was summed up by Commissioner Richard Bilas, who said he could not support holding the utilities responsible for the revenue shortfall. ""The DWR is not about to go bankrupt; the utilities are,"" he said. Yet consumer advocates downplayed the commission's ruling yesterday. Nettie Hoge, executive director of The Utility Reform Network, said the ruling only dealt with the narrow issue of who has to account for the revenue shortfall, and did not reach an overarching decision about who, ultimately, will be financially responsible for it. ""This is not a huge deal,"" she said. The state has been buying the lion's share of its power in the real-time market run by the Independent System Operator since the demise of the longer- term California Power Exchange, said Jesus Arredondo, a spokesman for the exchange. The state has been paying premium prices because it is buying in a market that was designed to handle last-minute emergencies. The governor's office has been seeking cheaper, long-term power contracts with only modest results. Small electric producers OK big price cut By Ed Mendel STAFF WRITER February 23, 2001 SACRAMENTO -- Legislators said yesterday that small generators who produce about 30 percent of the state's power have agreed to cut their power prices in half, an important step toward easing the electricity crisis. Negotiations continued on what Gov. Gray Davis has called the final step: the state purchase of the transmission systems of the three investor-owned utilities in exchange for paying off their huge debt. Meanwhile, the amount that the state is spending to buy power for the customers of the utilities grows. Officials gave notice that an additional $500 million will be needed in 10 days, bringing the total to $2.6 billion. But for the first time in nearly six weeks the state did not declare an alert yesterday due to power shortages. More power was available from other states, and some power plants that had been shut down for maintenance resumed operation. Two legislators, Sen. Jim Battin, R-Palm Desert, and Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, said they introduced legislation that sharply reduces the prices paid to small generators after weeks of difficult negotiations. ""Ultimately, this bill will reduce the cost of energy to the state and its ratepayers by billions of dollars,"" said Battin, who represents eastern San Diego County. About half of the small generators use ""renewable"" technologies such as solar, wind, geothermal and biomass. The rest is ""co-generation,"" when fuel is used for industrial purposes and electricity is generated as a by-product. The small generators have grown to produce nearly a third of California's power under a two-decade-old federal ""qualifying facilities"" program, which requires utilities to buy their power. Battin and Keeley said that under the bill, SB 47X, the average price for these QF contracts could drop from the current 17 cents per kilowatt-hour to about 8 to 8.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. ""We believe that the rates are at least that low, if not lower,"" said Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers, which represents small and large generators. The small generators support the bill because it will give them a stable price for five years, avoiding ups and downs and the possibility that state regulators might make a more unfavorable price cut. Much of the current price formula is based on the price of natural gas at the California border, which has soared this winter. The legislation spreads the price bench mark over a five-year period. ""We encourage the Legislature to take quick action to approve SB 47X as quickly as possible to help stabilize the electricity crisis,"" Smutny-Jones said. He said one of the side agreements to the legislation is the creation of a portfolio of long-term contracts to purchase natural gas for some co-generators, lowering their production costs. The legislation was applauded as ""a major step forward"" by a group of small generators who formed a creditors committee last week and threatened to take the utilities into bankruptcy. ""We call on the Legislature and the governor to act on it immediately,"" said Chris Thompson, a spokesman for the group. Thompson said Southern California Edison continues to collect money from ratepayers, as the state buys power for its customers, but is not paying anything to the small non-polluting generators. A spokesman for a geothermal generator in El Centro, which filed a lawsuit seeking $45 million from Edison for power provided since November, welcomed the legislation for giving generators stability and ratepayers cheaper power. But Vince Signorotti, a spokesman for CalEnergy, said it would be ""premature"" to consider dropping the lawsuit. Battin and Keeley said that payment of the small generators depends on the governor's attempt to negotiate the purchase of the transmission systems of Edison, Pacific Gas and Electric, and San Diego Gas and Electric in exchange for payment of their debt. As part of the governor's plan, the utilities would agree to provide low-cost power for five to 10 years from their generators, which provide about a third of the state's power. Davis aides are attempting to negotiate long-term contracts with generators for the remaining third of the power required by the state, sharply reducing the cost of buying power on the expensive spot market. But the governor said this week that many generators are reluctant to sign long-term contracts until they know how the utilities will pay their debt for previous power purchases. The state called off all power alerts yesterday for the first time since mid-January, rescinding a Stage 1 alert declared Wednesday. Grid operators made the change after increased power supplies became available. ""The supply situation this week has gradually been improving,"" said Lorie O'Donley, a spokeswoman with the California Independent System Operator, which manages most of the state's power supplies. However, she said the improvements shouldn't deter consumers from conservation. ""It is good news to be out of electrical emergencies but we just want to remind everybody that we are looking at a long-term power supply situation here,"" she said. ""And the high-demand summer is just around the corner. So we would ask that people continue with their conservation efforts."" In San Francisco yesterday, state power regulators decided unanimously that the Department of Water Resources is responsible for buying any power that cash-strapped utilities are unable to generate or buy on their own -- no matter what price wholesalers are charging. But the PUC voted 3-2 against taking action that would have allowed the DWR to receive a portion of ratepayer revenues from the utilities to help cover the cost of buying electricity. The state, through the DWR, was authorized by a recent law to buy power for the utilities. Edison and PG&E have such low credit ratings that no power companies will sell to them. SDG&E's rating is much better, but its debt also was mounting. The DWR purchases that portion of electricity beyond what the utilities provide through their own generating plants and through existing long-term contracts. But the DWR has refused to buy power beyond a certain price. That means more last-minute power purchases on the expensive spot market. The utilities and the state had disagreed over how the DWR will be reimbursed -- whether through state bonds or ratepayer dollars -- and the extent of its power-buying role. The author of the bill authorizing the long-term contracts, Assemblyman Keeley, said the legislation's intent was to fully cover the one-third of the power that utilities purchased on the spot market, either through extended contracts or through the state ISO.

Subject:: Other Aspects of Cheney Energy Report Recommendations of Interest
 to Enron -- Coal and Enviro Related
Body:: Below is the text of recommendations taken from the summary of recommendations in the Cheney Energy Report being released later this morning that focus on coal and coal-related issues, including environmental. ""The NEPD Group (National Energy Policy Development) recommends that the President direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to propose multi-pollutant legislation. The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct the EPA Administrator to work with Congress to propose legislation that would establish a flexible, market-based program to significantly reduce and cap emissions fo sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury from electric power generators. Such a program (with appropriate measures to address local concerns) would provide significant public health benefits even as we increase electricity supplies. Establish mandatory reduction targets to emissions of three main pollutants: sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury. Phase in reductions over a reasonable period of time, similar to the successful acid rain reduction program established by the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act. Provide regulatory certainty to allow utilities to make modifications to their plants without fear of new litigation. Provide market-based incentives, such as emissions trading credits to help achieve the required reductions."" ""The NEPD Group recognizes the importance of looking to technology to help us meet the goals of increasing electricity generation while protecting our environment. To that end, the NEPD Group recommends that the President direct the Department of Energy to continue to develop advanced clean coal technology by: Investing $2 billion over 10 years to fund research in clean coal technologies. Supporting a permanent extension of the existing research and development tax credit. Directing federal agencies to explore regulatory approaches that will encourage advancements in environmental technology. ""The NEPD Group recomemnds that the President direct federal agencies to provide greater regulatory certainty relating to coal electricity generation through clear policies that are easily applied to business decisions."" ""The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy and other relevant agencies, to review New Source Review regulations, including administrative interpretations and implementation, and report to the President within 90 days on the impact of the regulations on investment in new utility and refinery generation capacity, energy efficiency, and environmental protection."" ""The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct the Attorney General to review existing enforcement actions regarding New Source Review to ensure that the enforcement actions are consistent with the Clean Air Act and its regulations."" ""The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct federal agencies to support continued research into global climate change; continue efforts to identify environmentally and cost-effective ways to use market mechanisms and incentives; continue development of new technologies; and cooperate with allies, including through international processes, to develop technologies, market-based incentives, and other innovative approaches to address the issue of global climate change.

Subject:: Re: Weekly Notes
Body:: We are discontinuing the executive car wash. You, Steve and I should talk. From: Bill Donovan@ECT on 05/17/2001 03:29 PM To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron, Maureen McVicker/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: Weekly Notes Steve - I will be taking this Friday, the 18th, off on vacation. Here are notes for your staff meeting. Buyer/Seller have executed Offer Letter on Falcon EX ($32,750,000 price). Aircraft goes to pre-purchase inspection this weekend. Close is no later than June 6th. All indications are that buyer is very motivated to complete the deal. Enron Center South (ECS) Project remains solidly on track. We are 10 weeks out on initial occupancy with Level 3 occupancy (EGM moves Aug. 3rd). Levels 4 (EIM, ENW, & Credit.Com) occupies two weeks later (Aug. 17). Level 5 (Power) occupies two weeks after (Aug. 31st - Labor Day weekend). Level 6 (Gas) occupies two weeks after (Sept. 14th). Level 7 (Executive) and the 1st floor public spaces occupies year end. Level 2 (Cafeteria) opens Nov. Found a Law firm interested in Azurix's present space in Three Allen Center (3 floors). Goal is cut deal and have them in by year end. Enron Broadband indicates an intent to remain on their present ECN floors (Levels 44 and 45), plus backfill balance of operations into Wholesale's vacated trading floors. This splits them into two elevator banks and becomes problematic for ETS - who wants continuous floors, ECN Levels 39 through 46. We are seeking subtenants for Broadband's Portland office space. They plan to vacate the Riverplace building by Oct. Negotiating new food service contract with Sedexo Marriott to add ECS cafeteria. Total compensation will be based on 3% fee on gross revenue - only on individual sales of $2 or more (promote greater # of meals served) and bonus based on sharing of net operating income with Enron. Global Sourcing is participating with us in negotiations. Need to decide if Executive Car Care program is going to be continued (30 executives participate with employee paying $70 per month and business units subsidizing $275 per month). Decision needed because new Garage will require $60K in improvements to get set up for car washing. Present lease on remote car washing facility (@ $5k per month) expired and we are on month to month holdover. We are two weeks out to close on Beltway 8 land deal ($1.7 purchase price). Real estate being acquired for construction of new $18 mill. Data Center and Disaster Recovery Facility. Phillipe and I meet with Frevert next week to get approvals. - Bill

Drayton McLane will attend. They are looking for $1000 to host or $500 sponsor. Congressman Edwards has been very helpful with our defense procurement issues, and we have contributed to him recently. The Congressman's main request was to include Ken Lay's name on their invitation which Ken Lay graciously agreed to do so the Congressman is most pleased. Thus, the remaining request to attend and give additional money is up to you, although if we have room in our budget and Ken Lay or Tom White were available, I would recommend their attendance.

Body:: No, I had the right date from our previous communications. Nicholas O'Day 08/31/2000 09:25 PM To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Maureen McVicker/HOU/EES@EES Subject: Ken Lay/ Jeff Skilling visits I have noticed a fairly significant typo in the note below. The correct date for the key note address is 26 October, as set out in my first note. Did that impact on the issue of availability? ---------------------- Forwarded by Nicholas O'Day/AP/Enron on 09/01/2000 11:20 AM --------------------------- Nicholas O'Day 08/31/2000 08:01 PM To: Rosalee Fleming/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: John Mark Schroeder/LON/ECT@ECT, Joseph P Hirl/AP/ENRON@ENRON, Mika Watanabe/AP/Enron, Takashi Kimura/AP/Enron@Enron Subject: Ken Lay/ Jeff Skilling visits Ken Lay Visit. Following discussions with the Prime Minister's office and a quick check with venues 31 October is firming up as the preferred date for a meeting with the Prime Minister and an office opening by the PM. Jeff Skilling Visit. The Nikkei and the Tokyo University have now made the decision to invite Mr Skilling to give the key note address at the symposium on 26 November in Tokyo. As mentioned, the symposium is the most prestigious conference on IT in Japan. While the conference itself receives significant media attention, the President of Nikkei has offered to interview Mr Skilling. This honour is usually reserved for Heads of State. The interview will be featured on the front page of the Nikkei and picked up by other major media services. kind regards Nicholas O'Day 08/29/2000 07:43 PM To: Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES, Rosalee Fleming/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: John Mark Schroeder/LON/ECT@ECT, Joseph P Hirl/AP/ENRON@ENRON, Mika Watanabe/AP/Enron, Takashi Kimura/AP/Enron Subject: Re: Ken Lay meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Ken Lay Visit. Balancing the need to push out the arrangement of high level meetings as far as possible with the desire to have a meeting with Prime Minister Mori prior to the US Presidential election, the week commencing 30 October would be the optimum time for a visit by Mr Lay. PM Mori is generally available in that week. We will get a preferred time from the PM's chief secretary first thing tomorrow morning Tokyo time. Jeff Skilling Visit. The boards of Nikkei and Tokyo University Institute of Advanced Studies have yet to make a decision on the key note speaker for the one day invitation only seminar to be held on 26 October. As mentioned, the boards will choose between the chairman of Cisco and Jeff Skilling. The conference is focused on the IT revolution and an invitation only event for approximately 600 of Japan's corporate leaders. The speaking panel and topics for discussion will be developed around the key note speaker. If Mr Skilling were to give the key note speech, it is likely that key senior Government Ministers would be asked to present at the seminar. Following the Prime Minister's commitment at the Okinawa summit of US$15billion expenditure in the region on IT infrastructure and education, Japan's focus on e-commerce is almost reaching fever pitch. There will be significant interest in the conference from senior levels of Government and the business community. Further, as you would expect with the involvement of the Nikkei, there is typically significant media coverage associated with the key note speaker's presentation. kind regards

Thanks - Chris ---------------------- Forwarded by Stephen D Burns/Corp/Enron on 10/12/2000 02:14 PM --------------------------- Larry Fineran <LFINERAN@nam.org> on 09/12/2000 02:06:44 PM To: cc: Subject: ACTION ALERT -- ELECTRONIC MONITORING URGENT ACTION REQUESTED On Thursday, September 14, the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the House Committee on the Judiciary is slated to consider H.R. 4908, the Notice of Electronic Monitoring Act. H.R. 4908 is sponsored by Subcommittee Chairman Charles Canady (R-FL-12) and cosponsored by subcommittee member Bob Barr (R-GA-7). The bill would require employers to notify employees about electronic monitoring. The National Association of Manufacturers urges its members to notify their employees about internal monitoring practices. Nevertheless, H.R. 4908 is being placed on a fast track that could allow for many unintended consequences. The NAM urges you to contact the Subcommittee on the Constitution at (202) 226-7680 and subcommittee members (see below) to urge postponement. Message: The September 6 hearing on H.R. 4908 was not well advertised and did not include the views and concerns of employers. Because of the nature of computers and other electronic equipment, any ""electronic monitoring"" bill has to be carefully written so that it does not interfere with other fiduciary and legal responsibilities of employers. This is far too important an issue to ""rush through"" the process. For more information, call Larry Fineran at (202) 637-3174 or e-mail him at lfineran@nam.org. Subcommittee Members: Charles Canady (R-FL-12), Chair -- (202) 225-1252 Henry Hyde (R-IL-6) -- (202) 225-4561 Asa Hutchinson (R-AR-3) -- (202) 225-4301 Spencer Bachus (R-AL-6) -- (202) 225-4921 Bob Goodlatte (R-VA-6) -- (202) 225-5431 Bob Barr (R-GA-7) -- (202) 225-2931 William Jenkins (R-TN-1) -- (202) 225-6356 Lindsay Graham (R-SC-3) -- (202) 225-5301 Mel Watt (D-NC-12), Ranking Member -- (202) 225-1510 Maxine Waters (D-CA-35) -- (202) 225-2201 Barney Frank (D-MA-4) -- (202) 225-5931 John Conyers (D-MI-14) -- (202) 225-5126 Jerry Nadler (D-NY-8) -- (202) 225-5635

Subject:: Re: CONFIDENTIAL - MORE - back
Body:: Here is the answer regarding the approvals in South Korea. You will see Mike is concerned about shareholder agreements, which I have not raised with you before, as that seems beyond the scope of what you asked for, and I assume that we encounter this in many deals, but he has elaborated his concerns below, whcih are there for you to reach your own views on. Let me know if you need more. mcs ---------------------- Forwarded by Mark Schroeder/LON/ECT on 02/06/2000 17:09 --------------------------- Mike Dahlke@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 02/06/2000 15:49 To: Mark Schroeder@ECT cc: Subject: Re: CONFIDENTIAL - MORE - back Mark You are correct that asset sales will bring into play considerable ""approval"" issues, e.g. transfer of the ""franchise"" or business license of 9 separate CGCs. A stock sale generally avoids these issues. If the Enron then plans to ""sell"" it's direct shares in the JV, then there is, I believe a ""Fair Trading Commission"" notification that is required. Your word, ""proforma"" probably describes the nature of FTC approval here. However, this may not be an insignificant matter if a ""buyer"" such as Tractable or Samchully were involved the FTC might be ""active"" in it review of the transaction because of concerns about the Seoul Metropolitan area. I still believe Enron's biggest challenge related to dealing the JV shares directly, is the ""honeymoon"" clause in the ""Shareholders' Agreement"" between ourselves and SK Corp. Darrell Kinder commented to me recently that he did not feel that the ""monetization"" process that was being developed would suffer as a result of this clause - he said he couldn't see on what basis SK would object. A transaction that involves another true ""industry"" buyer, however, may be a very hard sell to SK. Regardless of the nature of the buyer (financial institution or energy sector operator), SK is likely and legitimately bargain hard. Enron, considering they have always maintained that a partnership with Enron was one of their objectives for organizing the JV with us. It is said that our price was not the highest one but SK's Chairman Chey ""broke the tie"" based on his reception in Houston in October of 1988. Hence, SK might now oppose strongly to protect itself. If Enron should sell the shares of Enron, Korea LLC rather than the underlying shares in SKE, then it may be subject to some notices in the US (check) but may avoid the kOREAN issues. But it may avoid the ""honeymoon"" period approval by SK Corp. (Legal/Tax questions for the most part). The ""change of control"" issue that I briefly mentioned is relates to any language that triggers the ""honeymoon"" provisions based on the ""ultimate"" parent being some entity other than Enron. If such language is lurking somewhere in the document. then all roads would seem to lead back to having SK Corp's blessing. Hope this is clear as jet lag has grabbed my brain this evening. Mike D. Author: Mark Schroeder, June 2, 2000 To: Mike cc: Subject: one more Still in confidence: Is there any required notification to competition authorities in South Korea, like the US version of Hart-Scott-Rodino, for changes in asset control ownership? thanks mcs Mark Schroeder@ECT 06/02/2000 04:06 AM To: Mike cc: Subject: CONFIDENTIAL - MORE Mike - I think I am correct in inferring from your note on the subject of the financing we have been reviewing, that sale of our stock in the joint venture triggers no regulatory approval, and that this also implies that there would then be NO local approvals required. Your earlier e-mail noted the ""pro forma"" (my word choice, not your's) approval for transfer of assets, but I am assuming that this does not extend to changes in ownership at the parent/holding company level, i.e., there is no intnetion to reach what would be a de facto change in ownership/control of assets via a stock sale. Hopefully, I am being clear, if not let me know, and more importantly, let me know if I am correct. thanks mcs

Subject:: Re: Tax Valuations for YR2000
Body:: Congratulations! Gary Fitch@ENRON on 07/27/2000 12:02:47 PM To: Bill Donovan/EPSC/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES Subject: Tax Valuations for YR2000 Bill, we hit a home run this morning with HCAD. They have agreed to take my reduced valuation on the Enron fleet. A reduction of $16,079,000 in taxable value. This results in savings of $482,375. That's not all, our allocation based on records for operations outside of the state of Texas resulted in additional savings of $1,559,638. Total savings to our 2000 budget will be $2,042,013.

Joseph P Hirl@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 02/16/2000 02:08 AM To: James D Steffes@EES cc: Scott Michael Steven J Kean@EES Subject: Govt School Alumni Jim, Good to see you last week. As we begin to look for Japanese employees and in particular, RA/GA resources it would seem to make sense to tap into the US Graduate Schools (eg Kennedy School, W Wilson School, etc). It would be a real coup if we could find an ex MITI employee for example that was educated in the States and had a taste for something ""exotic."" It won't necessarily be easy. At HBS we had two Japanese in our section that decided not to go back to their sponsoring company. Today one is working for BCG and the other Cargill. Any thoughts, contacts, etc. Joe

Subject:: Legislative Update -- Two Track In The Senate and House Update
Body:: We face two parallel tracks in the Senate in the coming weeks between now and the start of the congressional recess for one week on June 29th. In the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, we will be facing efforts by pro-price caps forces who will use the committee ""bully pulpit"" to pressure FERC into more action. This effort is led by incoming chairman Bingaman with support from Majority Leader Daschle. They are saying they will consider acting on the Feinstein-Smith price cap legislation unless FERC takes unspecified additional action by the end of this month. The new track in the Senate will be in the Governmental Affairs Committee chaired by Sen. Lieberman (D-CT). While this committee does not have the legislative jurisdiction over energy that the Energy Committee does in terms of moving legislation, the Governmental Affairs Committee has broad oversight and investigatory jurisdiction over all federal agencies, including FERC. New chairman Lieberman held his first press conference as chairman today and said addressing high energy prices would be a priority. In that vein, the committee is expected to hold a hearing on June 13 featuring some of the economists who wrote a letter in favor of price caps last month. We are checking with the Republican staff to make sure that the anti-price cap economists (the majority of the discipline, of course) will also testify. We also brief committee members and staff with our arguments against price caps and the latest publicly available market data. On June 20 the committee will hold a hearing on whether FERC has properly exercised its duties under the Federal Power Act to make sure that wholesale power rates are just and reasonable. We are going to meet with the committee majority staff, but we presently expect this hearing to have political witnesses (i.e., elected officials, possibly including Gov. Davis). We must keep in mind that Sen. Feinstein had earlier written to Chairman Lieberman asking for a hearing on the California energy situation, including relationships between FERC and those it regulates (citing the NY Times article involving Enron and Chairman Hebert). There is at present no indicationi that either hearing will address this matter. We are, as you might imagine, paying close attention to this situation. Over in the House, Energy and Commerce Chairman Tauzin has said he will write to FERC asking them to extend the April 26 price mitigation order to the entire west and to extend it to 24/7. He also asks FERC to see if it can implement ""negawatts"" demand reduction administratively. We are in the process of obtaining a copy of the letter, which has not yet been made public. Also in the House, we expect congressional committees to begin marking up portions of the President's energy legislation and related topics as the month unfolds.

In between the hamburgers, hotdogs, homemade ice cream and occasional dip in the pool that many of you will undoubtedly be enjoying Monday, be sure to take a few minutes to turn your TV set to the Jerry Lewis Labor Day Muscular Dystrophy (MDA) Telethon on NBC. At 1:10 p.m., Enron's own Linda Jenkins will present a $100,000 check to Jerry's Houston team. The donation, which will benefit research for ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease -- the disease Linda has been living with for the past three years), was raised by devoted friends and volunteers at the Enron/MDA Beach Bowl held in July. Thanks to all of you who raised money for this cause that is close to our hearts at Enron. And have a happy and safe holiday.

Subject:: Re: ken lay tour
Body:: I have advised against Ken or Jeff attending the generators meeting: Ken is still willing to make time avail on the 3d to meet with the gov. From: Susan M Landwehr on 04/29/2001 05:04 PM To: Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, Janel Guerrero/Corp/Enron@Enron, Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron, Maureen McVicker/NA/Enron@Enron, Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron, Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Re: ken lay tour All--here's some thoughts on the RGA related events. We currently have Ken scheduled to participate in an energy roundtable discussion on the afternoon of the 2nd with at least four governors attending that session--Kempthorne, Hull, Geringer and Ridge. (Engler and Rowland are also attending the overall event, but they will be in a healthcare breakout session). Kaufman and I thought that it would be particularly helpful for Arizona Gov Hull and Idaho Gov Kempthorne to hear Ken's remarks and have a chance to talk with him. I have also been working with Rosalee to schedule an early evening (6:00-7:00pm) meeting that night with Exelon co CEO John Rowe. John Rowe will be in California for some investor meetings and well as attending some sections of the RGA events. I have told my counterpart at Rowe's office that we would confirm Ken's availability on Monday morning. If you do decide that Ken should attend the Davis meeting in Sacremento that day instead, we will just reconfigure a bit. Paul and I will cover the RGA events and I will cancel the John Rowe get together. I would also want to talk about having Mr. Lay reach out to Hull and Kempthorne via phone sometime in the near future. Same with Rowe.

She said the Governor wanted to invite Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling to a meeting the Governor is having at 2:00 p.m. in Sacramento on May 2 with a lot of CEOs. I still pressed for a one on one meeting on May 3 in Sacramento, but she told me the Governor wanted to have the one meeting all at once and his schedule was very tight on Thursday, May 3. I transferred her to Sherri and called Ken. Ken wanted me to try to get more specific information, which she shared that it is with generators - Sempra, Williams, CalPine, Duke, Dynegy, and Reliant. She also said since the Governor has worked with Ken, she thought he might prefer that he attend. Ken said to let you all know and be thinking whether we even want to do it. He said one thought might be that he'd do that meeting and maybe Jeff could do the one in L.A. on May 2. Talk to you Monday.

Rosalee....we're giving Steve the briefing book today so he can review over the weekend and we'll have a final copy to Ken before he departs next week.

Subject:: Confidential - New Procedures to be introduced by ENA OTC for Exec
 Employment Agreements and Hiring of Commercial Staff below VP into ENA
Body:: David, i agree in principle with this process. I assume that you and your team will implement. Like we spoke about, I do not see a need to widely distribute this through the commercial organization. I would just implement. Regards Delainey ---------------------- Forwarded by David W Delainey/HOU/ECT on 09/27/2000 12:24 PM --------------------------- David Oxley 09/26/2000 01:55 PM To: David W Delainey/HOU/ECT@ECT, John J Lavorato/Corp/Enron@Enron, Kay Chapman/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kimberly Hillis/HOU/ECT@ect cc: Mark Frevert/NA/Enron@Enron, Cindy Skinner/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sheila Knudsen/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Sheila Walton/HOU/ECT@ECT, Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Confidential - New Procedures to be introduced by ENA OTC for Exec Employment Agreements and Hiring of Commercial Staff below VP into ENA This would appear to be final draft. Dave/John if you are happy, perhaps you can ask Kay or Kim to send out under ENA OTC header to distribution list below. David To: ENA VP's and MD's CC: Olson, Frevert, McMahon, Bowen, McConnell, Shankman From: ENA OTC Re: Confidential - New Procedures to be introduced by ENA OTC for Exec Employment Agreements and Hiring of Commercial Staff Below VP into ENA Effective immediately we have asked the ENA HR department to implement the following changes to procedures to assist us in managing these two very important processes, more consistently and effectively: Hiring of all Commercial Managers or Directors (VP process will remain as is) Business Unit leads and MD's will remain responsible for developing and pursuing speculative talent for their groups and, within their budgets, will also remain responsible for managing their overall headcount. The HR department will continue to support this effort by focusing on providing each of you with a flow of speculative resumes which you should spend time each week reviewing and providing feedback on so that this pipeline can be refined and better targeted. The interviewing process for all Commercial Managers and Directors should be very rigorous and should include at least 2 interviews by VP's in addition to the sponsoring Business Unit lead plus a minimum of 3 senior individuals within the sponsoring group (ie total of 6 in most cases). Effective immediately, once the sponsoring group lead has completed their interviewing process and would like to extend an offer of employment, the candidate must be interviewed by the ENA OTC, before an offer of employment will be released by the HR department. No candidates should be referred to the ENA OTC for interview before the sponsoring group has concluded and resolved ALL issues surrounding whether they themselves wish to hire the candidate. Since any offer of employment at Commercial Manager or Director will now be contingent upon approval by the ENA OTC, candidates expectations should be managed to ensure they appreciate this final interview will be necessary. John Lavorato has agreed to conduct the majority of these interviews, which will be co-ordinated via your HR representative. Where the candidate is out of town, these will be conducted via telephone. Executive Employment Agreement Process for Commercial Staff Effective immediately, the process for identifying and negotiating Executive Employment Agreements for Commercial staff at ENA will be modified as follows: For all Commercial staff, the sponsoring Business Unit lead or Managing Director, should agree in principle the need for a contract with John Lavorato of the ENA OTC. This request should be by either email or voicemail and should include the following information: (1) Name, (2) Level (3) Business focus and/or project (4) Their latest 2 PRC results (5) The reason or justification for offering them a contract. In any other instance (ie non-commercial employees), the sponsoring BU lead or MD should contact David Oxley, Wholesale Group VP for HR for direction. Once the ENA OTC has approved in principle the negotiation of a contract, your HR representative listed below will assist you in preparing draft financial terms on the familiar contract request form. Before a draft contract will be prepared by the ENA legal team, the financial terms (the request form in other words) must be approved by John Lavorato in the ENA OTC. In the event of a tight deadline, John may approve the two steps described here at 1 and 4 simultaneously by email or voicemail. Any subsequent changes in terms must also be approved by the ENA OTC before a fresh draft will be produced. The following HR Representatives will assist you with these new procedures: Power Trading - Kim Melodick 57273 Gas Trading - Jeanie Slone 53847 West Power - Amy Fitzpatrick Portland West Orgin - Amy Fitzpatrick Portland East Orgin - Fran Mayes 37211 M&A, Principle Inv - Dave Hill 34218 Upstream Orig - Dave Hill 34218 Capital Services - Dave Hill 34218 Generation Assets - Dave Hill 34218 Mexico - Dave Hill 34218 East Coast Power - Dave Hill 34218 Canada (Trading/Orig) - Dawn Doucet Calgary Energy Op's - Sheila Walton 30649 BAR - Sheila Walton 30649 Legal - Sheila Walton 30649 Comp Analysis - Sheila Walton 30649 Research - Sheila Walton 30649

Subject:: FW: Convolution
Body:: -----Original Message----- From: Andrews, Naveen Sent: Wednesday, June 27, 2001 10:08 PM To: Presley, Mike E; Jia, Winston; Thomas, Mark E.; Nordstrom, Mary; Tamarchenko, Tanya; Mao, Yi; Yu, Jin; Sokolov, Jason; Lew, Jaesoo; De, Rabi; Bharati, Rakesh Cc: Port, David; Kaminski, Vince J Subject: Convolution Apropos to the questions in today's talk: (1) whether a random variable X, a Multivariate T distribution, = bZ (where b is a univariate r.v =sqrt(v/y), and y is a chi-square distribution with v degrees of freedom), can be correlationless, attached below is a succinct proof. (2) One might think that since we are multiplying 2 random variables (i.e., Z is 2 dimensional) by the same scalar random variable (i.e., b), then the resultant random variables would tend to rise and fall together, and hence necessarily be linearly correlated. However, as is shown below, if Z is uncorrelated, then X is uncorrelated. Please note, our approach is analagous, but not identical to the Glasserman and Co papers (distributed to Research). Glasserman computes the characteristic function of the Pr(P/L > x), so to compute the entire P&L pdf he would have to repeat the procedure for every value of x. We circumvent that iterative approach (with the messy characteristic function) and compute the pdf in one shot. Please note, we are not comparing full reval vs. delta-gamma at all, that is a completely different story. Naveen

Body:: My copy shows long term comp on the exhibit under ""Grant Award"". And yes, the date will be revised. Mark Schroeder@ECT 04/14/2000 03:31 AM To: Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES, Mark Frevert/LON/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: new contract The contract Mark gave me to review yesterday only covers monthly salary. I had expected there to be some discussion/reference to long-term comp plan. Mark had mentioned that what he gave me did not deal with certain non-compete payments owed to me in 2000, so I am not looking for that, but I did think he had said that there was something in the doucment re:long-term, which I cannot find. Please advise if I am missing something. I will withhold other comments for now, except to note that the draft was dated 13 March, and had a 14 day period before expiry (now passed), and will assume that that is an irrelevancy. Look forward to hearing from one of you. mcs

Subject:: Call to Bob Glynn
Body:: Per our discussion this morning, below is a summary of items to discuss with Glynn: Adding Enron's ""negative CTC claim"" to the list of claims: PGE's filing included a list of top twenty creditors. Our negative CTC claim was apparently not taken into account in compiling that list. The list is nonbinding, however. PG&E will be required to file schedules of creditors on April 20. Our negative CTC claim should be on Schedule F (for unsecured claims). You may want to remind Glynn of your previous conversations and state our expectation that the negative CTC claim will appear (preferably as uncontested) in the April 20 filing. (Note: if PG&E does not include the claim we have an opportunity to file a proof of claim and ultimately the court determines the validity of the claim). Including Enron on the Creditors' Committee: PG&E may have the opportunity to influence representation on the creditors' committees. There are several reasons to suggest to Glynn that we be included: 1) we are a big creditor, 2) we could be helpful in crafting a broader solution, and 3) we are one of the real parties in interest behind the PX and ISO (who were listed as significant creditors but are really just ""passthroughs"" for the suppliers ... and PG&E likely would not want to have those political bodies serving on the creditors committee anyway).

Subject:: DRAFT Comments on Barton RTO Draft
Body:: Attached for review and comment is a draft set of talking points on the Barton RTO discussion draft. I went through the testimony at the recent hearing and parsed the legislative language of the discussion draft. You will see that the talking points are designed to respond to two basic points being raised by our opponents: (1) that FERC is rushing and being heavy-handed and (2) that the only interests involved are those of the transmitting utilities (i.e., no mention of discrimination as being what RTOs will remedy). Please let me have your thoughts in the next few days. Once Capitol Hill is up and running again, we will distribute the final talking points to our consultants and to members/staff of the Barton Subcommittee as we continue our efforts against the discussion draft's treatment of RTOs.

He has sent to Jeff, Mike McConnell (who told him he's forwarding to Dan Reck, who is in charge of the new freight business), Lou Pai and Andrew Miles, Tom White and David Cox. ---------------------- Forwarded by Rosalee Fleming/Corp/Enron on 03/02/2001 08:28 AM --------------------------- Enron Energy Services From: Chad Tipton @ EES 03/01/2001 06:12 PM To: Kenneth Lay/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Subject: Enron Opportunity Ken, My name is Chad Tipton. I am currently a Development Support Manager with EES in the Integrated Asset Management (IAM). Recently, I had the good fortune to meet, Ron Hosmer. He represents a company called IdleAire Technologies, Inc.. IdleAire is a startup company started in 1999. IdleAire has developed a system to eliminate truckdrivers from having to idle their trucks while on long haul overnight stops. Their plan is to electrify truckstops and install remote HVAC units to eliminate truck idling. Also, these units provide cable TV and internet services. They have already piloted the technology in several truckstops in the Knoxville, TN area. IdleAire's goal is to: ""........evolve the nation's truck stops and travel centers into the largest truck stop electrification network in the world. We are taking truck stop electrification to the next level. Our travel center conversions provide heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) at every parking space. We also provide drivers in-cab telephone, Internet and television."" Idle Air has caught the attention of many interest groups in Washington, D.C. Ron tells me that they have already gained support from Tennessee congressmen, including Jimmy Duncan and Van Hilleary. Also, former House Speaker, Newt Gingrich is on the board of directors of IdleAire Technologies. These individuals support this technology because it reduces emissions and helps state quality for CMAQ funds. I had mentioned to Ron, that I worked for Enron and informed him about what we do. He and I both felt that Enron may be interested in developing a strategic partnership to take their technology to market. Ron said that they are looking for a strategic partner with energy related experience and the capital to invest in this project. Enron would benefit in several ways: 1. Greater than average returns. 2. Increased publicity and recognition in Enron's environmental role. (EPA Energy Star Label, EPA Climate Protection Award, etc....) 3. Increase markets for electricity and possibly gas. 4. Maintain Enron's title of innovation leader. 5. Open a whole new market for the energy services group. (EES) Long term maintenance contract, commodities, etc.... 6. Open a new market for the broadband services group. (EBS) Videos on demand. I believe this opportunity is very synergistic with Enron's business model. If you would be interested in talking with Ron, I would be happy to introduce him to you. They have a very comprehensive business plan that lays out their business in detail. I have arranged for him to provide us with an executive summary of the business. You can also find out more about the company by visiting their website at: www.idleaire.com Thank you for your time. Chad Tipton 5-5310

Subject:: Summary of $ at Risk for Customs
Body:: Please see attached. Rob, perhaps while in London you could stop by Mark's desk to discuss. ----- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/NA/Enron on 03/07/2001 11:22 AM ----- Mark Schroeder@ECT 03/07/2001 03:45 AM To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Jane Subject: Summary of $ at Risk for Customs Steve - the issue to which I believe Jane is referring in the first sentence (""confirmation of the issues which I have articulated"") concern possible paymensts made to receive informal, and favourable, guidance, on customs issues (which informal opinions are now seemingly being reversed, formally). In some cases such payments may still be legal. But, subject to Jane confirming that I am explaining this correctly (given that the communication below is a bit cryptic), it now seems to me to be timely (as Rebecca and Jim have apparently been alerted in London on Monday, per her note below) to satisfy yourself that we are now clean on this issue under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The informal customs advice was obtained by Muktesh Tyagi (spelling?), one of two people known as Sanjay's ""fixers"" (that should make you fell comfortable!). You may wish to discuss with Jane further, but once you satisfy yourself that there is some smoke here, my thought was that you might want to simply confirm with Rebecca that we are running the facts to ground, so that we can satisfy ourselves that we are either clean, or need to come clean with USG. let me know if you need more. thanks mcs ---------------------- Forwarded by Mark Schroeder/LON/ECT on 07/03/2001 09:42 --------------------------- Jane Wilson@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 07/03/2001 04:38 To: Mark Schroeder@ECT cc: Subject: Summary of $ at Risk for Customs Mark, I have confirmation of the issues on which I have articulated concern to you although such confirmation is verbal. Apparently, there are more areas that I will identify in due time. This information was conveyed to the Legal Team (which included Rebecca, Bruce, Sandeep Katwala and outside attorneys) in London on Monday. In addition, below is additional bad news. In addition, there is at issue now the fact that the flow diagrams and import lists do not match. I'll forward an additional e:mail from Seethayya, ---------------------- Forwarded by Jane Wilson/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on 03/07/2001 10:04 AM --------------------------- Heidi Hellmann 03/06/2001 01:39 AM To: Jane cc: Robert Chandran Subject: Summary of $ at Risk for Customs I found out more info on some of these extraneous customs issues above and beyond the LNG stuff: PHASE I ISSUES 1. SPM (This equipment has already been imported at 22.38%, but customs is claiming merit duty rates of 67%.) This is currently being evaluated by the courts. Total Value at Risk = $7 MM 2. ""D"" - Stream Are Bechtel's design charges of $66 MM specific to our equipment or to the project as a whole? If the former, then duty of 22.38% should apply. Total Value at Risk = $13.5 MM ($66 MM x 22.38%) PHASE II ISSUES 1. Services Loading on Power Plant Equipment Same issue as for LNG Equipment. Currently we are paying a 10% loading on duty into a reserve deposit to cover this. Total Value at Risk = $22.38 MM ($100 MM x 22.38%) 2. LNG Equipment to be dutied at 53.8% or 22.38%? Think we all know this issue. Total Value at Risk = $56 MM (as per Risk Matrix) 3. Services Loading on LNG Equipment Think we all know this issue Total Value at Risk = $80 MM ($149 MM x 53.8%) TOTAL VALUE at RISK ~$180 MM - - This is WORST, WORST CASE! Note: There is still this issue of goods being imported under the wrong classification. Currently, this is preventing goods from being imported on time, which could lead to delay claims by the contractors. It will take me some time to hunt down what this could cost us if the problem isn't resolved soon. Pavan's estimate is that it will take a month for Site to generate accurate equipment lists and for the same to be reviewed and approved by MSEB. Heidi

The horrible year for California began last May when electricity prices suddenly began to soar, triggering a debate about the cause of the mysterious price increase that is likely to continue for years. It started when a three-day heat wave, from May 21 to May 24, set records in some areas of the state and drove up the demand for electricity as Californians sought relief with air conditioning. More record heat June 14 in the San Francisco Bay Area strained the overloaded system of Pacific Gas & Electric and resulted in rolling blackouts, the planned temporary power outages that some fear may be routine this summer. The average price of electricity on the now-defunct Power Exchange soared to $120 per megawatt hour in June, five times higher than the same month the previous year, and remained roughly at that level until skyrocketing to $377 in December. San Diego sounded the statewide alarm last summer as San Diego Gas & Electric, the first utility to be deregulated, passed along much of the higher cost of electricity to its customers, until legislation rolled back and capped the utility's rates in September. The executive director of a San Diego consumers group, the Utility Consumers' Action Network, thinks the generators and the marketers of power, using sophisticated computer methods, learned something as the heat wave drove up the demand for power. ""It was the first time the generators had an opportunity to see how high the price could go,"" said UCAN'S Michael Shames. ""It was their primer. It was Gouge 101."" State Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, who chaired a two-house committee that completed the deregulation plan in 1996, had seen routine monitoring data suggesting that the power market was being manipulated to drive up prices. Peace took the unusual step last June of personally urging the adoption of a much lower price cap by the board of the agency that makes last-minute power purchases to maintain the grid, the Independent System Operator. But the motion failed by a single vote. The consumer representative who cast the decisive vote against the lower cap resigned afterward with a blast at Peace, complaining of heavy-handed pressure. Peace is unapologetic. He believes that stronger action by the ISO last June would have sent a signal that might have discouraged market manipulation. ""It's just like the Federal Reserve mis-timing an interest-rate move,"" Peace said. The former ISO chairman, who represents generators, cited an ISO report attributing the price increase last May to the heat wave, power plant outages, less hydroelectric power and higher prices for the natural gas used by power plants. ""I think all of those things showing up at the same time resulted in significantly higher prices,"" said Jan Smutny-Jones of the Independent Energy Producers. Why power prices remained at high levels and even soared last winter, instead of dropping as usual, is more difficult to explain. The ISO contended last month that generators overcharged by more than $6 billion from last May through February. But federal regulators, who have their critics, have found only $125 million in overcharges, making it an ""annus marvelous"" for generators. Ed Mendel is Capitol bureau chief for the Union-Tribune.

Updated: Monday, April 30, 2001 12:40 AM?ET ????? ? Such a surcharge, at least in the short run, would fall hardest on the state of California, which since January has spent more than $5 billion buying power because the utilities have been unable to meet their obligations. For now, the idea is nothing more than a proposal that occupies one paragraph buried in a 39-page order issued Thursday concerning changes to California's flawed deregulated electricity market. The commission is seeking public comment on the surcharge proposal for 30 days. After that, it will decide whether to implement it. The fee was proposed by Commission Chairman Curt Hebert, a Mississippi Republican, as a way ""to stabilize the market,"" he said Friday, ""since part of the problem in California has to do with nonpayment of bills by the utilities."" But the provision also has the potential to funnel billions of dollars to energy suppliers at a time when those payments are the subject of intense negotiation. One of the utilities, PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (PCG, news, msgs), filed for protection from creditors under U.S. bankruptcy law on April 6, hoping to settle its claims with power suppliers for something less than face value. Representatives of Pacific Gas & Electric and Edison International's (EIX, news, msgs) Southern California Edison declined to comment on the FERC proposal Friday. The surcharge idea faces stiff opposition from some state officials, one of whom said it amounts to an ""unwarranted intrusion"" into state jurisdiction. Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, said imposition of a surcharge would put pressure on wholesale-power costs that already are too high. Bulk power cost $7 billion in California in 1999 and topped $27 billion last year as prices careened out of control. Ms. Lynch said she opposes the surcharge provision and the entire order given Thursday, but that it will be up to the full commission to decide how -- or whether -- to file a challenge at FERC. A spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis said ""the governor would be strongly opposed to any attempt to siphon money away from the state"" and expects to lodge an objection. Los Angeles Times ?????????????????????April 30, 2001, Monday, Home Edition SECTION: Part A; Part 1; Page 3; Metro Desk LENGTH: 792 words HEADLINE: CAPITOL JOURNAL; CALIFORNIA AND THE WEST; How Sales Tax Is Falling Through a Loophole BYLINE: GEORGE SKELTON DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Dot-coms are in distress and laying off. Silicon Valley is a home buyer's bazaar. The Nasdaq is nauseous. So is this any time to be siccing the tax collector on Internet retailers? ??You bet. Coddling these techie traders with tax favors doesn't seem to be helping them much anyway. So why not treat e-tailers like everyone else, like brick-and-mortar merchants? Treat everybody evenhandedly. ??That's the view of Assemblywoman Carole Migden (D-San Francisco), assertive chair of the Assembly Appropriations Committee. For the second straight year, Migden is pushing a bill she says will close a loophole that benefits some Internet retailers. She insists it's about fairly enforcing existing law, not about a new Web tax, as critics claim. ??Present law requires Internet e-tailers to collect the sales tax if they have a physical presence in California, such as a traditional brick-and-mortar store. But some big outfits have created separate out-of-state subsidiaries to handle their Internet orders. Same goods, same ads--with a large tax loophole because the subsidiary ostensibly does not have a physical presence in California. ??Never mind that an unsatisfied customer of bookseller Barnes & Noble dot-com, for example, can return the Internet purchase to the local Barnes & Noble store. ??Many e-tailers with dual ""bricks-and-clicks"" operations do collect the sales tax from Internet customers. Migden cites Macy's, Wal-Mart, REI, Hewlett-Packard and Eddie Bauer. Others refuse, she says: Barnes & Noble, Borders Books, KB Toys, Gateway Computers, Radio Shack. ??Her bill simply ""clarifies"" that the sales tax applies when the e-tailer is affiliated with a California business, sells identical products, and they market jointly. ??""Right now,"" Migden contends, ""certain big businesses blatantly violate the tax law and put hard-working, honest small business people at a disadvantage."" ??* ??Gov. Gray Davis is miffed at Migden, she hears. He vetoed her bill last year, declaring ""it would send the wrong signal about California's international role as the incubator of the dot-com community."" Internet marketing ""must be given time to mature,"" he maintained. ??Now Migden's at it again. ""The governor's exercised. He thinks I'm jamming him,"" she says. ""But I'm moving the bill. He can veto it if he wants. I'm putting it on his desk."" ??It already has cleared the Assembly tax committee and will shoot out of her panel Wednesday, headed for the Assembly floor. Last year, Democrats backed the bill. Republicans opposed it, siding with the Democratic governor. ??Davis fears some future opponent will claim he signed a bill to tax the Internet. Migden is frustrated by that Internet tax tag, calling it ""a lazy misinterpretation."" ??""I'm not picking on e-commerce,"" she protests. ""I'm picking on the multinationals who are arrogantly evading the law in complicity with the state Board of Equalization."" ??That would be, in particular, Republican board member Dean Andal of Stockton. ""It's the usual liberal nut case bill,"" Andal says. ""Just a bill chasing no problem."" ??* ??The BOE administers the sales tax. And Andal does agree that if an Internet purchase can be returned to a store, the e-tailer legally must collect the tax. ""We've been looking into that,"" he says. ??The board shouldn't have to look far. Barnes & Noble tells e-customers right on its Web site that ""you can return purchases to ANY Barnes & Noble store for in-store credit."" ??But other than that, Andal contends, a company has a constitutional right to create an out-of-state subsidiary to avoid taxes. ??And, he notes, we're talking about relative pennies: $ 17 million annually, the BOE estimates, compared to $ 39 billion in total California sales tax collections. That lost revenue would cover only about seven hours worth of electricity the state now is buying for utilities. ??But e-tailing is bound to grow. Tax avoidance could become significant, benefiting dot-coms while discriminating against small retailers and the poor who cannot afford Internet access. ??Migden will be in a strong position to change sales tax policy if she wins her race next year for the five-member BOE. She's the early front-runner. ??Her concern--her reverence--is for the local booksellers, the mom-and-pop merchants, the neighbor shopkeepers who can be smothered by the big tax evaders. ""The little guy with the books stacked in the back,"" she says, ""sweeping the sidewalk, putting on extra locks, obeying the law and collecting taxes--trying to make a go."" ??Davis wants to be seen as a futuristic, New Age pol, worthy of campaign donations from wealthy Web masters. But he can manage that without tromping on his Democratic roots as protector of the little guy. LOAD-DATE: April 30, 2001 of 103 DOCUMENTS 2001 / Los Angeles Times Angeles Times ?????????????????????April 30, 2001, Monday, Home Edition SECTION: Part A; Part 1; Page 3; Metro Desk LENGTH: 1808 words HEADLINE: CALIFORNIA AND THE WEST; THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY CRISIS; LIST OF PG&E CREDITORS SHOWS FIRM'S WIDE REACH IN BUSINESS; BANKRUPTCY: IT INCLUDES SMALL AND BIG COMPANIES, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND FORMER EMPLOYEES. BYLINE: TIM REITERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO BODY: ??It reads like a phone book: Able Auto Body, Able Building Maintenance, Able Fence Co., Able Printing, Able Termite & Pest Control. . . . ??These companies are among about 50,000 entries on Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s roster of creditors recently filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court. ??Another company, A&J Electrical Cable Corp. of Hayward, has supplied PG&E with utility cables since 1980. But now the unpaid bills are hitting the $ 100,000 mark--and that is a big deal to a relatively small business. ??""Who would ever think that PG&E would be in bankruptcy?"" said owner Magdalene Reilly. ""This is something affecting people. I've got a lot of paychecks on Friday. ??""We have orders for the rest of the year from PG&E ,"" she added. ""It is a question: Do you decide to ship? . . . We probably will. They are a good customer."" ??When PG&E filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors April 6, businesses from California to Canada were caught by surprise. The names of the 20 biggest creditors, some with billion-dollar claims, were filed with the court. The utility also submitted a list of potential creditors--more than 3,500 pages worth. ??The roster speaks to the remarkable economic clout and reach of a company that prospered for almost a century before plunging into the third-biggest bankruptcy case in U.S. history. It provides a glimpse into the relationships between a giant utility--the state's largest--and businesses of all sorts and sizes. And it underscores the high stakes as a bankruptcy judge reorders PG&E's financial affairs and decides in the coming months, if not years, who should be paid and how much. ??The case, said U.S. bankruptcy trustee Linda Ekstrom Stanley, ""has a ripple effect. . . . Creditors are affected, and they can't pay their bills either."" ??There are small companies and conglomerates that sold power to PG&E. ??There are financial institutions from Wall Street to San Francisco's Montgomery Street that lent money or provided services. ??There are government agencies at all levels, even the California Public Utilities Commission. ??There are some retired PG&E employees and officers, including at least one of the company's former chief executive officers. ??But there also are vendors that have provided goods and services to PG&E for years: tree trimming around power lines, bodywork for the utility's truck fleet, fencing for its vast land holdings, calibration of meters, fans to cool electrical transformers, printing of brochures, signs for office doors, flight suits for aviators who patrol power lines, limousine service for traveling executives. ??No dollar amounts are attached to names on the master list. But records and interviews with dozens of creditors show that the sums owed range from hundreds of millions of dollars to very little--or nothing at all. Many of the smaller creditors were unaware they were on the roster until contacted by The Times. ??PG&E used to buy pump filters from California Pump & Supply in Sacramento. ??""We just closed out their account because they owed us $ 29,"" said office manager Lisa Giordano. ""It's a hassle to get anyone over there. I just wrote it off."" ??The utility bought $ 38 worth of plants from Forest Nursery in Los Osos, west of San Luis Obispo. ""It's nothing to go to court about, especially since they paid it,"" said bookkeeper Lori Parsons. ??A wine wholesaler, an ice cream company and a coastal hotel are listed. So is Sing A Long Productions in Burlingame, which supples disc jockeys and karaoke. ??""I am sure we have done business with PG&E and other companies that have parties from time to time,"" said owner Nick Foster. ""Maybe somebody forgot that we did not get paid."" ??PG&E spokesman Ron Low said the list includes everyone to whom the utility wrote a check in the last two years, such as homeowners who received energy conservation rebates and retirees who received checks related to benefits. ??""It was an attempt to notify anybody who possibly could have a claim against the company and to cast the widest net possible,"" he said. ??Several PG&E retirees, such as Robert W. Oliver of Berkeley, were baffled by their inclusion on the list. ""I draw a little pension,"" said Oliver, who was a personnel executive and left the company in 1980. ""It's a vested pension."" ??Another retiree on the list is former Chief Executive Richard A. Clarke. ??He and about 10 other former high-ranking PG&E executives or their survivors have retained an attorney to help ensure that their retirement benefits are protected during the bankruptcy case. ??""We don't want someone to get the idea that this is a bunch of well-heeled executives trying to get a piece of the action,"" said the attorney, John T. Hansen. ""Some in our group are widows of former executives who depend on the pensions they receive as survivors."" ??Hansen said some retired executives have deferred-compensation packages that might be considered a general unsecured bankruptcy claim. ??One concern, he said, is that PG&E Chairman Robert D. Glynn Jr. wrote recently in a San Francisco Chronicle op-ed article that health care plans and other benefits ""for employees and most retirees"" will continue. ??""We would want to know what 'most' is,"" Hansen said. ""We want to sort it out."" ??Low of PG&E said fewer than 100 retired employees, most former officers, ""have a portion of their pension that is unsecured."" That means their claims will be handled in Bankruptcy Court with those of other unsecured creditors whose debts are not backed by utility assets. ??The spokesman emphasized that ex-employees could be on the list because they received a check from the company for something. ??Companies and individuals on the list, PG&E said, will be contacted and given an opportunity to state their claims, which the utility will file with the court May 11. ??Meanwhile, the effects of the bankruptcy filing continue to ripple beyond the utility. ??PG&E's action hit AA Safe & Lock Co. in Santa Cruz particularly hard. The firm replaces keys and locks for PG&E offices and trucks. ??""We are a small business, and it is a big account,"" said owner Paul Bing, who declined to say what the utility owes. ""We haven't been doing as much for them since the whole crisis started."" ??A Hayward firm that conducts environmental testing when PG&E remodels or razes buildings is out money too. Ken Byk, president of Forensic Analytical, would not provide a figure but said: ""I am obviously concerned. . . . They are a good customer, but any time you run into these problems, it's disappointing."" ??California Steam Inc. of Sacramento services PG&E pressure washers and water recyclers at its truck-cleaning facilities. ""I have just a couple of invoices out,"" said service manager Bruce Amlin. The debt, he said, is less than $ 500. ??A similar amount is owed to California Turbo Inc. in Ontario. Sales manager Cam Young said the utility has not paid for eight fans used to cool electrical transformers. ""We're a small business,"" Young said, adding with a laugh: ""We might have to eat peanut butter and jelly for four or five months."" ??Within days of the bankruptcy filing, PG&E sent about 12,000 creditors letters that began: ""Valued Goods and Services Provider: . . . Unfortunately, the bankruptcy code precludes payment for goods and services received prior to the date of filing. Payments on this pre-petition debt will be settled as part of the plan of reorganization."" The company assured vendors that they will be paid for any future purchases. ??Some are not only forgiving, they are outspokenly loyal to PG&E. ??The relationship between the utility and AG Signs of Stockton spans two decades. When Tony Guebara was starting his company, PG&E gave him business. ""They try to help the little guy,"" he said. ""Just about everybody in town is a vendor. They have people here who paint their trucks."" ??AG Signs now has five employees and supplies PG&E with door lettering for trucks, name plaques for office doors and signs and flags for construction sites. ??Guebara said the utility's debt does not worry him: ""PG&E has treated me real well. If I lose a couple of bucks because of this adversity, that is OK. . . . I don't think we've seen the last of PG&E."" ??Many businesses and individuals said they had no idea why the company believes it owes them money. ??Being included on the creditors list left the Vallejo Camp Fire Girls & Boys and other charitable organizations somewhat confused. Officials of one Berkeley church could only speculate that it was listed because PG&E stock was bequeathed to the congregation decades ago. ??Twylah Lemargie, manager of the Cancer Aid Thrift Shop in Grass Valley, said the utility is not even a customer. ""PG&E did come in and replaced lots of our ceiling lights with the long tubes,"" she said. ""But it was done free as an energy saver."" ??A number of vendors said PG&E's account is paid up. ??The utility rented temporary housing units for workers on a hydroelectric project about two years ago, but California RV Rentals in Rio Lindo is still named as a creditor. ""They don't owe me money,"" said Sandra Weaver, the manager. ""If they want to give me some, it's OK."" ??Many creditors are health clubs and health care providers: medical and dental offices, foot and joint specialists, pharmacies, chiropractors. ??When informed that the Castro Valley Chamber of Commerce was on the creditors list, the woman who answered the phone laughed uproariously. Then Executive Director Bonnie Dettmer came to the line. ??""I'm going to guess it's membership dues,"" she said. ""They are a member and they have been very supportive. I would bet they belong to every chamber of commerce."" ??One creditor is the state agency that PG&E says drove the company into insolvency by not allowing full recovery of its wholesale power costs. ??""They owe us $ 5.9 million . . . for environmental impact reports on PG&E projects,"" said Paul Clanon, director of the Public Utilities Commission's energy division. ""It's a serious amount of money but currently is not having an impact."" ??Top 10 Creditors ??The creditors owed the most money by Pacific Gas & Electric Co., according to the company's Chapter 11 filing: ???Creditor owed ???Bank of New York ????????????????????????$2.20 billion ???California Power Exchange ???????????????$1.96 billion ???Bankers Trust Co. ???????????????????????$1.30 billion ???California Independent System Operator ??$1.12 billion ???Bank of America* ?????????????????????????$938 million ???US Bank million ???Calpine Gilroy Cogeneration LP ????????????$58 million ???Calpine Greenleaf Inc. ????????????????????$49 million ???Crocket Cogen million ???Calpine King City Cogen LLC ???????????????$45 million ??* Heading a group of banks ??Source: U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern DIstrict of California GRAPHIC: GRAPHIC: Top 10 Creditors, Los Angeles Times PHOTO: Magdalene Reilly, owner of A&J Electrical Cable Corp. of Hayward, says her company has supplied Pacific Gas & Electric with utility cables since 1980, and that their unpaid bills are now hitting the $100,000 mark. ?PHOTOGRAPHER: ROBERT DURELL / Los Angeles Times PHOTO: ""They try to help the little guy,"" says Tony Guebara, owner of AG Signs in Stockton, of PG&E.

DAVIS' PLAN FOR NEXT YEAR FACES DEMANDS FOR BILLIONS AS A RESERVE AND TO CUSHION ELECTRICITY RATE HIKES. BYLINE: DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Jockeying over the state's next spending plan, a tradition that usually takes place in the summer, already is turning intense as the energy crisis casts a pall over what otherwise might have been relatively painless budget squabbles. ??A key state senator, worried about the slowing economy, is looking for places to pare as much as $ 4 billion from Gov. Gray Davis' proposed $ 104.7-billion budget. And Republicans are beginning to demand that the state spend billions in general tax money to cushion electricity rate hikes of up to 40% being imposed on consumers and businesses. ??Davis won't sign the budget for the 2001-02 fiscal year into law until late June at the earliest. But with California mired in the energy crisis and the economy slowing, the new budget is shaping up to be especially vexing. ??California's largest utility and a major private employer, Pacific Gas & Electric, is in bankruptcy. The state has spent $ 5.2 billion in general tax money to buy electricity, with no end in sight. Even before summer temperatures hit, Sacramento shelled out $ 90 million to buy electricity in a single day last week. ??And the Wall Street rating firm Standard & Poor's, unsure that the state will be reimbursed for the power purchases, lowered California's credit rating two notches for the first time since the recession of the 1990s. ??Brightening an otherwise cloudy situation, income tax payments are meeting or exceeding predictions. More than $ 8 billion in checks from April income tax returns have flooded into the Franchise Tax Board, said Department of Finance economist Ted Gibson. On one day last week, the state's haul was $ 3.6 billion, a record. ??""Receipts are very much on track, I'm relieved to tell you,"" Gibson said. ??But even as budget writers were exhaling, the payments merely offered proof that the economy was strong last year, back when then-President Bill Clinton was heralding the longest period of economic growth in U.S. history, and Californians' lexicon did not include the term ""rolling blackout."" ??State income and sales tax receipts softened in the first few months of 2001, an indication that people will be earning less this year--and paying less in taxes next year. ??Seeing trouble ahead, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Steve Peace (D-El Cajon) wants to boost the state's emergency reserve, which was $ 1.9 billion in January. To do that, Peace last week called on budget committee members to come up with a list of cuts totaling $ 2 billion to $ 4 billion. ??Without a larger reserve heading into 2002, Peace said, the slowing economy could force the state to make deep cuts or raise taxes next year, at a time when most legislators and Davis will be running for reelection. ??""The thing to be worried about is not the current year, but the trend line,"" Peace said. ??He adds a caveat for the spending plan that by law must be in place by July 1: There will be cuts if legislators fail to approve legislation that state Treasurer Phil Angelides says he needs to obtain short-term loans and market long-term bonds to finance electricity purchases. ??Davis and Angelides are preparing the largest bond sale--a way that government borrows money--in U.S. history, as much as $ 12.4 billion. The state would use the proceeds to ease the shock to utility customers of record high electricity prices this year. The bond debt would be paid off over a period of perhaps 15 years. ??Given the size and complexity of the bond issue, many legislators say Angelides may not be able to sell it for months. ??Davis, however, has an immediate need for money. The governor must release a revised state budget within weeks. So, he is pushing for legislators to approve legislation that would allow Angelides to obtain a short-term loan of as much as $ 6 billion. ??At least some of the proceeds of the long-term bonds would be used to pay off the short-term loan--sort of like using one credit card to pay the balance on a second piece of plastic. ??Republican legislators are balking at the idea. ??Back in December, before the state entered the power buying business, GOP legislators had called for $ 3.2 billion in tax cuts. With the energy crisis complicating the financial situation, some Republicans are contending that Davis should use as much as $ 5 billion from the budget surplus to soften the impact of electricity rate hikes. ??""That will be a de facto tax cut,"" said Senate Republican leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga. ""Our Democratic friends want to do the bridge financing so they can increase the size of government."" ??Republicans are in the minority. But they have a significant voice, because state law requires that both houses of the Legislature approve spending decisions by a two-thirds vote. ??The state Constitution says the budget must be in place by the July 1 start of the new fiscal year. Davis signed his first two budgets on time. Given this year's uncertainties, however, some legislators are thinking twice about making July vacation plans. ??The sudden turnaround may come as a shock to many legislators and lobbyists who seek slices of the state budget pie. ??In recent years, legislators have grown used to the multibillion-dollar windfalls of tax payments, which allowed them to deliver new swimming pools, school programs, museums, parks, social and health care spending, and tax cuts to their constituents. Indeed, the budget in Davis' first two years grew 37%, even as the Democratic governor and legislators cut taxes by $ 3.9 billion. ??In a Legislature populated by term-limited newcomers, only a handful of current legislators were in the Capitol in the early 1990s, when the worst recession to hit California since the Great Depression caused the state budget to actually shrink. Then-Gov. Pete Wilson and the Legislature reacted to a $ 14-billion budget gap by raising taxes by more than $ 5 billion and slashing spending. ??""It is not going to be the pie-in-the-sky budget some of us thought it would be last year and even as late as January,"" said Sen. Jack O'Connell (D-San Luis Obispo). ??Veterans of the annual summer rite say there is no template for the coming budget fights. Jean Ross of the California Budget Project, a private budget watchdog and advocacy group, said Davis and legislators not only must pay attention to the economy. ??They also must take into account many unknowns: Will the judge overseeing PG&E's bankruptcy proceeding seek to raise rates further? Will federal energy regulators be able to effectively limit wholesale electricity costs? What will the economic impact be of summer blackouts? ??""It's a lot more complex and unpredictable than other years,"" Ross said. ??Legislators say they are lowering their sights. But letters from state senators requesting money for their favored projects fill five large red binders. ""You wouldn't know there is a money shortage based on requests in appropriations,"" said Assembly Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Carole Migden (D-San Francisco), preparing for what she calls her ""hatchet role"" of blocking bills that require spending. ??For his part, Davis has not decided to significantly cut back on his proposals, ranging from a sales tax ""holiday"" timed for back-to-school shopping to plans to clean sewage from beaches. He won't reveal those decisions until he releases his revised spending plan.

BYLINE: FRANK A. WOLAK, Frank A. Wolak, an economics professor at Stanford University, is, chairman of the Market Surveillance Committee of the California, Independent System Operator BODY: ??Out-of-state firms selling into the California wholesale electricity market at exorbitant prices have been blamed for the current electricity crisis. They are, claim many observers, exercising their market power to raise wholesale electricity prices. ??Although it is not illegal under California or U.S. antitrust law for a firm to exercise its market power, it is illegal to do so under the Federal Power Act. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, which regulates the California wholesale electricity market, is the entity charged with enforcing this law. Its refusal to take sufficient actions that would result in ""just and reasonable"" wholesale electricity rates is the fundamental cause of California's current energy crisis. It is highly unlikely that anything it has done in the last week has changed things at all. ??In 1935, Congress passed the Federal Power Act and required the Federal Power Commission (the predecessor to FERC) to set ""just and reasonable"" wholesale electricity prices. Just and reasonable prices are those that recover production costs, including a ""fair"" rate of return on the capital invested by the firm. Moreover, if the FERC finds that wholesale electricity prices are unjust and unreasonable, the Federal Power Act gives it wide-ranging discretion to take actions that result in just and reasonable prices. The FERC can also order refunds for any payments by consumers in excess of just and reasonable prices. ??Almost 10 years ago, the FERC began to allow generators to receive market prices instead of prices set through a cost-of-service regulatory process. However, there is no guarantee that market prices meet the just and reasonable standard required by the Federal Power Act. Markets often set prices substantially in excess of the production costs for significant periods of time. This occurs because one or more firms operating in the market have what economists call market power--the ability of a firm to raise market prices and profit from it. ??However, if no firm possesses market power, the market price should be very close to a price that only recovers production costs. In such a circumstance, the price set by the market satisfies the just and reasonable standard of the Federal Power Act. ??Before it allows any market participant to receive a market price rather than a cost-based price set through a regulatory process, the FERC requires each participant to demonstrate that it does not have market power. In other words, each market participant must submit sworn testimony to the FERC demonstrating it does not have the ability to raise market prices and profit from this behavior. ??Each of the out-of-state generators made these filings before they began selling into the California market, which started in April 1998. Each firm had its authority to receive market prices approved by the FERC for a three-year period that ends before this summer for several of the firms. It is virtually impossible to determine on a prospective basis whether a firm possesses market power. Moreover, the methodology used by the FERC to make this determination uses analytical techniques that have long been acknowledged by the economics profession as grossly inadequate. The events of the past 10 months have demonstrated that contrary to their filings stating otherwise, all of the out-of-state generators possess significant market power. ??A number of independent studies have shown that the market power exercised by these firms has resulted in unjust and unreasonable rates from May 2000, until now. Moreover, in its Dec. 15, 2000 report on the California electricity market, the FERC concluded that wholesale electricity prices during the summer and autumn of 2000 were unjust and unreasonable and reflected the exercise of significant market power. ??Despite its own conclusion, the FERC thus far has refused to set just and reasonable prices for wholesale electricity in California. Instead, the FERC implemented market rule changes that have enhanced the ability of these firms to set excessive wholesale electricity prices. In addition, it has refused to order refunds for any overpayment during the summer and autumn of 2000 for the prices that it deemed unjust and unreasonable. ??Fortunately for California consumers, the California Public Utilities Commission and Gov. Gray Davis refused to be accomplices in the FERC's decision not to enforce the Federal Power Act. They refused to pass on to California consumers prices that the FERC itself had determined were unjust and unreasonable. ??Because these out-of-state firms must apply for renewal of their market-based pricing authority before this summer, the FERC has one more opportunity to set just and reasonable prices for wholesale electricity in California. It has before it several proposals that would enforce all provisions of the Federal Power Act. The health of the California and national economies would be severely undermined if the FERC continues to ignore its legal obligations.

OPPEL Jr. and LAURA M. HOLSON BODY: ??Pacific Gas and Electric, the giant California utility, may have just made one of the largest bankruptcy filings in history, but it has been a banner year for the rest of its parent company, the PG& E Corporation. ??In Bethesda, Md., far from the energy crisis in California, another PG& E subsidiary, National Energy Group, earned $162 million last year and ranked as the nation's third-largest power trader. Compensation for the unit's executives soared. Many investors now believe that the subsidiary, just a decade in the making, is by itself worth more than its 96-year-old utility sibling. ???How did National Energy get so big so fast? By using cash, partly generated by its sister utility, to buy unregulated power plants in the Northeast, expand trading-floor operations and sell power across the country. The exact numbers are in dispute, but much of Nationals Energy's profits last year came from California. ??Most other large utilities have done the same thing over the past decade, building national or even global power companies from roots in local monopolies. But nowhere is the success of these unregulated businesses more of an issue than in California, where PG& E's investments may be challenged in bankruptcy court. ??Still, such transfers of assets were fundamental to deregulation plans in two dozen states, and they were encouraged by federal rules designed to build a new wholesale marketplace in electricity. ??And today, the offspring of the nation's utilities dominate that market, after industry leader Enron. ?Eight of the nation's 10 largest power marketers are affiliates or spinoffs of regulated utilities, controlling about 42 percent of power trading. ??It is largely these unregulated power producers and traders whose sales of power in California have prompted accusations by state leaders of price gouging, and demands for the price caps that federal regulators took their first, halting steps toward embracing last week. ??The profitability of the utilities' unregulated operations is becoming clear as companies report earnings for the first three months of the year. ??For example, Reliant Energy reported that operating income at its unregulated wholesale energy business soared to $216 million in the first quarter, or 16 percent more than at its regulated utility, which serves Houston. This week, Reliant expects to spin off its unregulated businesses through an initial public stock offering that would put a market value on the new company of as much as $8.8 billion -- more than the rest of Reliant. ??A number of other major utility companies have spinoffs or trading and generation units that now earn nearly as much as, or more than, their core utility operations. These include Duke Energy in Charlotte, N.C.; Sempra Energy of San Diego; the Southern Company in Atlanta; the Constellation Energy Group in Baltimore; and Utilicorp United in Kansas City, Mo. ??In some places, the growth of the unregulated businesses continues to raise questions of fairness -- particularly where utilities have been permitted to transfer plants to the new units at deep discounts to their market value. Critics say that ratepayers, whose bills paid for the plants' construction, should benefit more when the plants are sold. ??In Florida, a commission on energy deregulation formed by Gov. Jeb Bush has proposed permitting such transfers on the grounds that they are needed to create a new wholesale marketplace. Opponents, including the Florida Municipal Electric Association, which represents utilities owned by local governments, say the plan would produce a $9 billion windfall that should go to ratepayers. ??In California, some creditors of Pacific Gas and Electric have signaled that they will want the bankruptcy court in San Francisco to review parent PG& E's efforts to keep its unregulated businesses out of creditors' reach. ??And the California Public Utilities Commission is investigating whether PG& E and Edison International, whose Southern California Edison utility unit is also near insolvency, have improperly transferred cash to their parents and to unregulated sister companies. ??A recent audit ordered by the commission showed that Pacific Gas and Electric transferred $4.1 billion to PG& E from 1997 to 1999. Most of that went to dividends and stock repurchases, but $838 million was invested in other subsidiaries, primarily its National Energy Group unit. Southern California Edison transferred $4.8 billion to its parent company between 1996 and November 2000, a separate audit showed; Edison International invested $2.5 billion in its unregulated Mission Group subsidiaries during the same period. ??Executives of the companies say the transfers were proper. Audits have shown that ""we followed the rules and didn't do anything wrong,"" said PG& E's chief executive, Robert Glynn. ""We did not ask consumers in California to support any of the losses that occurred in those businesses when we started them up,"" he said. Now, forcing the unregulated units to support their ailing sister utility, he said, ""would be no different than calling up shareholders and saying, 'The California electric bills are pretty high; send some money in so we can give it back to them.' "" ??Loretta Lynch, the president of the utilities commission, took a different view. ""Should we look backward,"" she asked, ""and say, 'Hey, wait a minute -- that corporate structure profited by all of our power payments to them in the past, and they should participate in helping us through to get to a solution in the future?' "" ??The cornerstone deal of PG& E's unregulated energy business was struck four years ago, when it acquired the hydroelectric and fossil-fueled generation plants of New England Electric System for $1.6 billion. PG& E is now one of the largest generators in the Northeast, operating plants that can light up to five million average-sized homes. ??While California officials say Pacific Gas and Electric's woes have been caused, at least in part, by market manipulation by out-of-state generators, the Justice Department has been investigating possible market abuses involving PG& E and two other companies in New England. Mr. Glynn said that PG& E had done nothing wrong and that the company has responded to Justice Department requests for information. ??Overall, PG& E's National Energy Group has 30 power plants in 10 states, and others under development or construction that include one in Athens, N.Y., that is expected to begin supplying electricity to New York City in 2003. It also operates an energy trading operation in Bethesda and controls a natural gas pipeline into Northern California. ??To Wall Street, the utility companies' investments in unregulated businesses were a necessary survival tactic, as investors demanded faster-growing profits. ??""The stock market was going like gangbusters, and the utilities' returns of 11 percent weren't cutting it,"" said Richard Cortright, a utility analyst at Standard and Poor's, the bond rating agency. ??Moreover, as deregulation loomed, industry executives saw no choice but to make new investments. ""It looked like the utility opportunity was going to start shrinking,"" Mr. Glynn said. ??Consumer groups question whether utilities would have invested more in improving basic service if they had not had the option of putting money elsewhere. ??Mike Florio, a lawyer with The Utility Reform Network, a consumer group in San Francisco, cited findings last year by state regulators that from 1987 to 1995, Pacific Gas & Electric spent nearly $550 million less on maintaining electric and gas facilities than had been factored into its rates. Separately, in 1999, the utility agreed to pay about $29 million to settle charges that consumers were endangered because it failed to trim trees near high-voltage power lines. ??""Several hundred million dollars didn't get spent for maintenance, and that ultimately falls to the bottom line as profit,"" Mr. Florio said. ??Mr. Glynn said the utility had always spent appropriate sums on maintenance, coming within one-half of one percent of the amount built into rates over a 20-year period. ??In the big picture, he said, it was hard to see how PG& E had been a winner in deregulation, even before its utility's humiliating bankruptcy. ""If you look at what happened, the net of it was a loss,"" Mr. Glynn said, ""because the value leaked out on the regulated utility side faster than we were able to build it on the nonregulated side.""

""(Hoge) has made TURN into the leading consumer utility advocate in the nation."" ???It's not glamorous work, nor is it particularly lucrative. Hoge, a lawyer by training, took a pay cut when she accepted the $75,000-a-year job in 1995. And, truth be told, most folks have no idea Hoge is in their corner. ???""There are other rewards,"" she said. ""You don't get the adoration of Joe Citizen standing up and yelling, 'Yay TURN!' But there's an excitement about being involved in the discussions where the big decisions are made."" ???The youngest of four children, Hoge bounced around the middle of the country as she grew up, following her career Army officer father from Kansas to Oklahoma to Texas. ???""All the places where you can shoot big guns,"" she joked. ???Hoge graduated from high school in Pullman, Wash. After a stint at the University of Southern California, she graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Washington State University and earned a law degree from the University of San Francisco. ???Hoge's entire career has been spent protecting the underdog.

""I'm not sure they wholeheartedly believe in regulation, and I think it comes from a distrust of regulators. But maybe I'm taking it personally."" ???Wood chastised TURN for supporting utility divestiture of generating plants as California's deregulation effort got under way. And he said Hoge places too much emphasis on the utilities' role in the energy mess instead of focusing on the profiteering of power generators. ???""The utilities have some culpability, but they are not the main driver behind the crisis,"" Wood said. ""TURN's interventions do not reflect that reality."" ???Still, he gave TURN high marks and credited Hoge with making it a far more effective advocate. ???Hoge admits she has had her hands full with the energy crisis, saying she and her staff ""are trying to keep our health and sanity."" ???Asked if she would have joined TURN if she had known how crazy California's energy market would become and how hard she would have to work, Hoge was characteristically wary. ???""I don't think anyone would want to sign up for this,"" she said after a moment's pause.

A03 LENGTH: 1669 words HEADLINE: Energy Forecast for Summer: No Blackouts but Price Spikes; Grid Managers Promote Conservation, Await New Plants BYLINE: William Claiborne, Washington Post Staff Writer DATELINE: CHICAGO BODY: ??The rest of the United States is virtually certain to escape rolling blackouts this summer like the ones that have plagued California, but record price hikes for electricity are likely in many places, energy experts agree. ???Despite their confidence that they can survive everything but an extremely hot summer without power outages, managers of the nation's interconnecting electrical power grids are anxiously awaiting new power plants that are scheduled to come on-line. They are also promoting more frugal consumption by power customers and seeking ways to avoid distribution logjams during peak demand periods this summer. ???""We see a big distinction between California and the rest of the country,"" said David Costello, an economist in charge of short-term forecasting for the Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the Department of Energy. ""We have no real reason to believe anyplace is unusually at risk."" ???But record spikes in the price of electricity are a given for this summer, some industry analysts say, because a growing proportion of power plants now run on natural gas, which has doubled in price over the past year. ???The DOE estimates that electricity demand will grow 2.3 percent nationally this year, with much higher increases in the West and the South. At the same time, the reserve capacity margin that utilities try to build into their systems to handle the hottest days -- when use of air conditioners and other appliances taxes supplies -- has been falling in some regions to well less than the desired 15 percent above peak summer loads. ???That means utilities may have to import large volumes of electricity over transmission systems that were not designed to handle them. What power officials are hoping to avoid are critical shortfalls in generating capacity in some regions, followed by overwhelming strains on aging high-voltage transmission lines as power is bought and sold across the country in increasingly competitive electricity markets. ???Even though scores of new power plants have been built in the Northeast, South and Midwest in recent months and many more are on the drawing boards, the expected 15 percent increase in new generation will not be fully on-line for another two years. That leaves parts of the nation vulnerable to outages if there are prolonged heat waves this summer, or if utilities are unable to start up new or rebuilt gas-fired power plants as scheduled, according to energy experts. ???Despite all those potential problems, there is no reason to believe that California's power nightmares will spread to the rest of the country, officials said. ???This year, utilities have announced they are adding 40 to 50 gigawatts of new generating capacity to gas-fired plants across the nation, compared with only 22 gigawatts that were added last year, Costello said. He said that even if half of those announced plants never materialize, this year's new capacity is certain to be as great or greater than last year's, meaning that the predicted increased consumption can probably be met. A gigawatt is 1,000 megawatts, or enough to power about 1 million homes. ???""We don't know that [transmission] infrastructure has really been fixed, but my sense is they're in better shape overall as far as capacity is concerned,"" Costello said. ???The nation's 203,600-mile high-voltage network has undergone relatively few changes in 50 years, during which deregulation has prompted electricity wholesalers to sell power at even greater distances to reach more lucrative markets, adding to the pressure on the grid system. ???California, in a sense, has been serving as a stalking horse for other states, some of which also deregulated their electricity systems and are consciously avoiding doing anything that resembles the California model. ???Eugene Gorzelnik, spokesman for the North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC), which oversees the interlocking power grids, said: ""Obviously, there will be problems in California and there's nothing that's going on that will solve those problems. But a lot of [utilities] people are looking at California and saying to themselves, 'Can I do this in a way they didn't?' That's a positive development."" ???Apart from California, the worst problems are expected in adjoining western states, as Golden State electrical grid managers scramble to buy electricity at a time when power production at the region's hydroelectric dams is already being cut because of shrinking water levels in reservoirs. ???The Northwest Power Planning Council recently reported that the demand for electricity has grown 24 percent in the past decade while new generation has grown only 4 percent. ???NERC is not expected to issue its long-awaited pre-summer electricity reliability assessment -- a document that forecasts peak generation and consumption -- until next month. But in interviews, officials of many of the 10 regional reliability councils that comprise the national grid system appeared fairly sanguine about the prospect of avoiding widespread brownouts this summer. ???""Assuming normal weather and assuming our generating units come off maintenance on schedule, we don't anticipate any particular problems meeting our loads,"" said Bill Reinke, executive director of the Southeastern Electricity Reliability Council. ???Reinke said the region was adding 300 miles of new transmission lines, has 5,600 megawatts of new generating capacity -- enough to power 5.6 million homes -- and is seeking to identify potential transmission bottlenecks so it can take preemptive corrective measures against distribution failures. ???Outside the West, the greatest potential for blackouts may be in New York, where the near certainty of transmission logjams in an antiquated infrastructure prompted Consolidated Edison Co. to request approval for 11 combustion turbine mini-generators in case of a power shortage. Residents and conservationists are appealing court approval of the generators on environmental grounds. ???Stephen Allen, spokesman for the Northeast Power Coordinating Council said, ""If the 400 megawatts the generators provide go on-line, it'll still be tight, but New York should be okay."" He said Upstate New York should have surplus electricity to sell to New York City, although some experts say transmission bottlenecks could make it difficult for New York City to import power on abnormally hot days. ???New York City customers, who have already had their electricity rates increased 40 percent in the last two years, could see prices rise an additional 50 percent because of the deregulated power industry's dependence on gas-fired generation, according to some analysts. ???Allen said that since last June, New England has added mostly gas-fired plants that generate more than 1,000 megawatts and should have an additional 2,000 megawatts on-line before the end of the summer. He said the region should have a 15 percent to 18 percent capacity margin. ???The Mid-Atlantic Area Council, made up of Maryland, Virginia, the District of Columbia, Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, is expecting a reserve margin of more than 16 percent and an increase of 2,100 megawatts in generating capacity over last year, to about 60,000 megawatts, according to the council's president, Phillip G. Harris. Harris said the council met last year's peak of 49,288 megawatts with no problems, though the summer of 2000 was relatively cool. ???Harris cited several reasons ""why we are not like California,"" including a decision to centralize all planning, which California did not; the creation of a regional market instead of a state-based marketplace like California's, and a policy of only slow, incremental changes in the grid. ???""A single misstep can have huge consequences,"" Harris said. ""We're tinkering with something that has worked for 100 years, so you better do it right."" ???In the Midwest, utilities expect a peak demand this summer of 55,221 megawatts, compared with 52,214 megawatts last summer, according to Richard Bulley, executive director of the six-state Mid-America Interconnected Network. But keeping pace with the nearly 6 percent increase in demand is the addition of 5,470 megawatts of capacity, Bulley said. ???""We do not anticipate any major limitations on the region's bulk transmission system, and we project a healthy reserve margin of more than 18 percent,"" he said. ???Since 1998, 33 companies have proposed projects in Illinois totaling 25,000 megawatts of gas-fired power. Although no one expects all of that to come on-line, the state's total generating capacity is just under 34,000 megawatts, meaning that even if only a modest amount of the anticipated power was added, the region would have a cushion, even in a hot summer. ???Officials of Commonwealth Edison Co., the biggest utility in Illinois, say that new or rebuilt electrical distribution facilities should prevent a repeat of the kind of disastrous power outages that crippled offices in Chicago's Loop last summer, when lines broke and transformers burst into flames. ???Few power grids are in as good shape as Texas's. The state anticipates a 23 percent power margin this summer and the addition of 9,188 megawatts of new generating capacity this year, according to Heather Tindall, spokeswoman for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). Texas utilities have 27 new power plants under construction and 31 more in the planning stages, she said. ???As a result, ERCOT is forecasting almost 70,000 megawatts of generating capacity this summer, compared with a peak demand of 57,600 megawatts on one 111-degree day last summer. ???Tindall said that after studying California's system, the Texas grid made a ""concerted effort"" to operate theirs differently. For example, she said, Texas supports utilities entering into long-term contracts for power, while in California, power companies did not enter into such contracts and were forced to pay exorbitant prices at peak times.

Gray Davis calls a federal regulatory order ""a Trojan horse"" that will profit power generators at California ratepayers' expense. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is considering requiring the state's electric grid operator to add a surcharge on power sales to pay generators the money they are owed by the state's two large financially strapped utilities. ??- State power buyers have asked for another $500 million to buy electricity for the customers of three cash-strapped utilities. That brings the total amount authorized for power purchases to $6.2 billion since mid-January, when the state began purchases power for Pacific Gas and Electric Co., Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric. ??- Gov. Gray Davis says state office buildings cut energy use by an average of 20 percent in January and February, saving taxpayers $286,000 in utility bills. ??- State officials negotiating long-term power contracts for customers of three cash-strapped utilities have secured five more contracts. Four of the contracts signed in March by the Department of Water Resources will provide 466 megawatts of electricity during times of peak demand this summer, according to DWR documents. One megawatt is roughly enough power for 750 homes. ??- California Public Utilities Commission attorneys are advising state agencies to avoid submitting monetary claims against Pacific Gas and Electric Co. despite the company's bankruptcy. The PUC is trying to retain their electric rate-setting authority over the utility and says submitting claims could bring the state under the court's jurisdiction as a creditor, which could allow the judge to set electric rates. ??- Shares of Edison International closed at $9.90, up 15 cents. PG&E Corp. closed at $8.94, up 20 cents. ??-The state remains free of power alerts as reserves stay above 7 percent. ??WHAT'S NEXT: ??- Davis' representatives continue negotiating with Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas and Electric Co., to buy the utility's transmission lines. Davis says he expects to have an agreement within two weeks. ??THE PROBLEM: ??High demand, high wholesale energy costs, transmission glitches and a tight supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in the Northwest and maintenance at aging California power plants are all factors in California's electricity crisis. ??Edison and PG&E say they've lost nearly $14 billion since June to high wholesale prices the state's electricity deregulation law bars them from passing on to consumers. PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. ??Electricity and natural gas suppliers, scared off by the two companies' poor credit ratings, are refusing to sell to them, leading the state in January to start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and business customers. The state is also buying power for a third investor-owned utility, San Diego Gas & Electric, which is in better financial shape than much larger Edison and PG&E but also struggling with high wholesale power costs. ??The Public Utilities Commission has raised rates as much as 46 percent to help finance the state's multibillion-dollar power buys.

BODY: ???Geothermal plants in The Geysers area north of the Napa Valley have tapped steam fields to produce electricity since the 1960s. The 350-degree steam rushes more than 1,500 feet up from the earth, spinning turbines that create a constant flow of electricity. ??But mismanagement of the steam fields beneath the hilly northwestern California region that straddles the Sonoma and Lake county lines has led to a large decline of pressure and a drop of more than 50 percent in the amount of power the plants produce. ??The geothermal decline comes as California already faces short supplies of hydroelectricity from the drought-ridden Pacific Northwest and growing competition for megawatts from other power-starved states. ??State power grid managers estimate they're losing about 900 megawatts of geothermal electricity due to the gradual depletion of the steam fields. That's enough power for roughly 675,000 homes. ??''They just overproduced. It is a renewable source of power, but it's renewable over geologic time,'' says Katherine Potter, a spokeswoman for Calpine Energy, which owns 19 of the 21 geothermal power plants in The Geysers region, which incidentally has no geysers. ??The first electricity produced by tapping into pockets of steam trapped in the earth made its debut in 1904 in Larderello, Italy. That plant, rebuilt due to World War II damage, is still operating. The first U.S. geothermal plant was a small operation at The Geysers built in 1962. ??Steam fields are created when water flows through fissures in the rock deep in the earth and is heated by hot magma. Geothermal plants tap into that pressure and use it to spin turbines. The plants' cooling towers release plumes of white steam, which can be seen for miles on a clear day. ??While The Geysers is a unique geologic formation called a dry steam field, there is the potential for thousands of megawatts of geothermal power from other regions that could use the more common ''wet steam'' process, said Karl Gawell, executive director of the Geothermal Energy Association in Washington D.C. ??Wet steam plants tap into superheated water in the earth, separate the steam and use it to power generators. The water and the condensed steam is pumped back into the earth. ??CalEnergy Corp. owns 10 power plants in Imperial County that produce about 330 megawatts of power, enough for about 247,500 homes. Those plants and others like them haven't seen a decline in pressure like Calpine's plants. ??Geothermal energy is second only to hydroelectricity as a continuous, cheap source of power, said Jan Stewart, Calpine's public relations manager. ??The plants in The Geysers reached their peak power production in the 1980s, producing about 2,000 megawatts of electricity enough to power about 1.5 million homes. ??At that time, about 30 companies were involved in various geothermal ventures in the area and didn't work together, Stewart said. ??''The resource wasn't being managed properly. As a result, it was a very fractured environment,'' she said. ''If one plant shut down, the steam would be vented to the atmosphere, instead of being rerouted to another plant where it could be used.'' ??In the 1960s and '70s when The Geysers got started, there was ''a real wildcatter's mentality'' among power generators, said Rich Ferguson, energy chairman for Sierra Club California. ??''Basically, they took out the water in the form of steam faster than Mother Nature was putting it back in,'' he said. ??The available steam declined, and the area now puts out about 850 megawatts, sufficient power for roughly 637,500 homes. ??Since then, geothermal engineers have learned more about managing the resource, Ferguson said. ??The superheated, self-contained system at The Geysers has no ??ater running through it. ?''The Geysers is unique worldwide. There really aren't other dry steam fields,'' Gawell said. ''In effect, there was never a sustainable level of production, you always would have depleted it eventually. It's like a giant pressure cooker. As soon as you put the first straw in, you began to deplete the resource.'' ??Calpine is experimenting with replenishing the steam fields by pumping treated waste water back into the earth. It began three years ago, when Lake County stopped pumping its treated waste water into Clear Lake. ??Now, more than 8 million gallons of treated waste water is returned daily to the earth. The experiment appears to be working _ power output is up 68 megawatts. ??''People like the stewardship that Calpine provides now,'' Ferguson said. '' Calpine has taken on as a long-term goal to make that sustainable.'' ??Calpine is building a 50-mile pipeline to Santa Rosa and plans to pump another 11 million of treated waste water daily from that city. The company expects that will boost production another 85 megawatts. ??Even with the new project, power grid managers say they're planning for diminishing geothermal electricity. ??''We've lost a considerable portion of their output due to the decline in the output of the steam,'' said Jim McIntosh, director of grid operations for the Independent System Operator. ''All supplies are very important to us at this point.'' ??The plants are relatively low-maintenance once they're running _ only one engineer staffs each of the 19 Calpine plants in The Geysers. ??But geothermal plants are more expensive to build than natural gas-fired power plants, Gaywell said. ??''It's like choosing between two identical cars one is $10,000 and the other is $30,000, but the $30,000 car comes with a lifetime supply of fuel,'' he said. ''People are shortsighted on investments and it takes more money upfront to build geothermal.'' ??Most geothermal resources are on public land, lengthening the building process because more permits are needed, Gawell said. ??Two new plants are in the application process in California. ??Researchers estimate there are 2,500 megawatts of untapped geothermal resources in Nevada, Gawell said. Idaho, New Mexico and Oregon also have sites that could be tapped, he said. ??''Many of these sites were looked at in the '80s, but then nothing happened because in the '90s natural gas was too cheap to meter,'' he said. ??Ferguson said the state spent $540 million over the last four years on incentives for renewable energy projects, including geothermal, solar, wind and biomass, and he expects the plan will be renewed when it expires in December. ??''We think there will be an equivalent amount of money,'' he said. ''All the technologies have to compete against each other, but geothermal should do pretty good.'' ??___ ??There are three types of geothermal power plants. Here's a look at how they work: ???Dry steam: Such plants are rare, producing steam and not hot water. The Geysers region is the world's largest dry steam field. Steam from the earth is piped to the power plant, where it spins turbines to create electricity. After the remaining steam condenses back to liquid, it is returned to the earth. ???Wet steam: This type of geothermal plant is more common. There are several such plants in Southern California. Hot water and steam are brought to the surface, separated and the steam is used to power turbines. The water is returned to the earth as is the condensed steam. ???Binary: These plants use hot water and steam from the earth to heat another liquid, such as isobutane, which has a lower boiling point than water. That liquid's steam is used to power turbines to make electricity. When the steam cools and becomes liquid it's returned to the tank and reused. This type of system is self-contained and has no emissions. ??___ ??On the Net: ??Geothermal Education Office: http://geothermal.marin.org ??California ISO: http://www.caiso.com ??Calpine Corp.: http://www.calpine.com ?????(PROFILE ?????(CO:Calpine Corp; TS:CPN; IG:ELC;) ?????)

BODY: ??Backers of a bill to prevent holders of concealed handgun licenses from bringing their weapons onto school property will spend the coming week trying to force a Senate vote on the issue. ??Also this week, House Speaker Mark Simmons is planning to schedule a hearing on his bill to pull the plug - at least for now - on a key part of an electric deregulation law that's due to take effect this fall for large businesses. ??The guns-in-schools bill has been on life support for weeks, with a key Senate committee chairman refusing to schedule a hearing on the bill on grounds that it is overly contentious and wouldn't pass anyway. ??The sponsor of the bill, Sen. Ryan Deckert, D-Beaverton, and other supporters aren't giving up, however. ??They are hoping to use a parliamentary maneuver that would enable them to move the school guns issue to the full Senate for debate by attaching it to another education-related bill. ??Gun owner groups say SB508 is unnecessary because there have been no documented cases of law-abiding carriers of concealed handguns causing any problems at schools. ??But a key supporter of the bill, Sen. Ginny Burdick, D-Portland, says she is convinced the measure would pass in both the House and Senate - if it can be brought up for vote. ??""I don't think we should wait to have dead children before we ban guns in schools,"" said Burdick, who was a chief sponsor of a measure passed by voters last fall expanding background checks at gun shows. ??California's power woes that were precipitated by that state's move to deregulation are giving Oregon lawmakers second thoughts about their decision to approve a phased-in deregulation of the electricity market in Oregon. ??A bill passed by the 1999 Legislature is supposed to open Oregon's electric markets to industrial and large commercial customers, beginning this October. ??The 1999 law is supposed to free large businesses to buy power on the open market, and does not deregulate electric rates for residential customers. ??Still, Simmons says that drought conditions and the power market turmoil caused by California's energy crisis require reconsideration of the law. ??For that reason, the House speaker is planning hearings this week on his proposal to enact a 15-month delay in Oregon's electricity restructuring efforts. ??""This just gives the opportunity for the energy markets to settle for a while,"" the Elgin Republican said. ??Similar legislation is pending in the Senate.

Tierney, a former assistant secretary in the Energy Department, now a consultant for Lexecon, a Cambridge, Mass., consulting firm. ??Like planets lining up to usher in an age of hysteria, a combination of unforeseen circumstances have put the Northwest behind the eight ball. In addition to California's self-created tangle, oil and natural gas prices are rising and a drought is stymieing the region's hydropower production. ??The situation is less volatile in other parts of the country. In the Northeast, South and Midwest, where growth has been modest and generating capacity has been more stable, there's less discrepancy between supply and demand. ??Undergirding the West's situation was some serious lack of foresight, Tierney said. ??When it looked like California power customers would be able to get electricity from whoever offered it at the cheapest price, utilities worried about recovering the money they'd spent building plants and transmission lines in the '70s and early '80s. So they sold off their power plants and bought power on the wholesale market, where it was cheap and plentiful. ??Not trusting the marketplace, California legislators capped the rates utilities could charge residential customers. When wholesale power prices went up, they couldn't pass those increases on to consumers. ??""At the time, they did not realize that in a couple of years there would not be an adequate power supply,"" Tierney said. ??California's economic explosion of the late '90s, coupled with a failure to build any new plants, brought the crisis to a head. Computers are not by themselves big energy consumers, but the factories that make them are. The Internet, with all its server farms and data hotels, also became a heavy power user. ??When demand in California finally caught up with supply, ""all of a sudden, utilities had to buy power, and it became a seller's market,"" Tierney said. ??But most of the Northwest's power comes from hydroelectric dams, and there has to be water in the rivers to power the turbines at the dams. In a drought year like this, the power has to come from somewhere else, most likely oil- and natural gas-fired plants, which fire up when demand is high. ??Because demand is so high this year, generators can charge exorbitant prices, knowing that California and the Northwest have nowhere else to buy power. ??Also, natural gas prices have gone through the roof in the last 18 months and aren't likely to come down until next year at the earliest. Until 18 months ago, the price of natural gas had been at a prolonged low, so companies weren't interested in expensive drilling projects. ??The problem is not likely to be permanent. As exploration and extraction pick up, prices will come down. The public has already begun to hear a conservation message, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is being deluged with applications for new power plant construction. ??Staff writer Paul Menser can be reached at 542-6752, or via e-mail at pmenser@idahonews.com.

FROM THE ENERGY CRISIS BYLINE: JEFF STANSBURY, Jeff Stansbury is a PhD candidate in American history at UCLA. His, dissertation is on the role of the labor movement in the building of, L.A.'s infrastructure BODY: ??Why is Los Angeles an island of tranquillity in the electric-power crisis that has rocked California and threatens to spread across the nation? ??News stories have repeatedly told us that the city's ownership and operation of its own generating stations is the principal reason. By staying clear of the state's 1996 deregulation scheme for private utilities, the Department of Water and Power was able to hold onto its power plants. ??So far, so good. But when we ask how Los Angeles came to enjoy public power in the first place, the answer commonly given makes a hash of history. ??Most historians and political scientists credit the city's progressive reform movement of 1890-1915 for having wisely settled on a municipal utility. True, some of the entrepreneurs, lawyers and reform-minded professionals who called themselves ""the best men"" during that era agitated for the city-built Owens Valley aqueduct and its generating stations. But many reformers opposed the city's effort to distribute its own power. Because they had allied themselves with railway magnate Henry Huntington, who owned an electric company, or because they favored regulation over municipal ownership, they wanted L.A.'s three private electric companies to sell and profit from aqueduct power. Meyer Lissner, a reform attorney often portrayed as a champion of public power, opposed the holding of a decisive 1911 citywide straw poll on the subject because he knew most Angelenos would cast their ballots for municipal ownership. That, he said, would be ""unfair"" to the three utilities. ??The most steadfast partisans of public power were not progressive reformers like Lissner but the city's much-maligned labor unions, and for a simple reason. While mistrust of oligopoly ran through nearly all sectors of society, it burned hottest in working-class wards. Without organized labor's dogged campaign for ""gas and water socialism,"" as well as its willingness to hand control of these resources to the anti-union regimes of Mayors George Alexander and Henry Rose, there would be no DWP today. ??Organized labor played a key role in the city's original decision to municipalize its water distribution system. On Oct. 24, 1892, 700 union members met to demand that the city build a small neighborhood waterworks as a step toward public control of the entire water supply. From that day on, L.A.'s unions never wavered in their call for a public water supply publicly managed. They mobilized the rank and file for the water-company buyouts of 1901-04, and, in 1906, the Public Ownership Party's citywide campaign primed voters to pour $ 23 million into construction of the Owens River aqueduct a year later. The aqueduct was the sine qua non of public power. At a time when most progressive reformers were mute on the subject, organized labor insisted that the aqueduct be used to generate electricity for the city's streets, homes and businesses. ??A broad consensus backed the city's construction of hydroelectric plants while the aqueduct was being built, but most of the city's politicians and corporate lobbyists were committed to public subsidies, not public ownership, of aqueduct power. The 1911 straw poll, in which city voters declared their support for municipal ownership and distribution of Owens River power, upset their plans. ??The most consistent fighters for public power during the decades after the straw poll were the Central Labor Council, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, other unions and city employees who stuffed campaign envelopes, canvassed precincts and got out the vote. Voters who favored municipally owned power and initiatives bolstering the DWP tended to be working class and Democratic; those opposed were mainly middle and upper class and Republican. ??In this polarized political climate, Mayor Alexander called for a $ 6.5-million bond issue to complete the aqueduct-power distribution network; he left open the question of who would sell the power to consumers. Unions and socialists tied their support for the bonds to a city charter reform that would guarantee them a long-sought role in city government through proportional representation. When the reform failed at the polls, they withheld support from the power bonds, and these, too, went down to defeat in 1913. Much of the rancor workers felt was aimed at progressives like Lissner, head of the Good Government Organization, who fought labor's charter plank because it would bring socialists onto the City Council. ??The labor movement's dedication to public ownership soon reasserted itself, however. With a citywide election coming up that June, five unionists seeking council seats on the Socialist Party ticket revived labor's long-standing demand for city operation of all public utilities at cost. They urged the City Council to hold a new power-bond election with a clear public ownership mandate. They attacked the power companies' efforts to buy aqueduct power from the city and sell it to Angelenos at a profit. Soon, the great majority of unions in the Central Labor Council were locked in what turned out to be a decisive struggle against the power oligopoly made up of Southern California Edison, Pacific Light & Power and Los Angeles Gas & Electric. ??An unprecedented event brightened the bonds' chances. A machinist, Fred C. Wheeler, won a seat on the City Council, the first unionist to do so in the 20th century. Wheeler led a successful fight against an attempt to split the power-bond issue into two separate ballot propositions, one to complete the aqueduct's generating stations, the other to create a city-owned distribution system. Such a division would probably have doomed public power. ??The large majority of unionists who favored public power had little time to savor Wheeler's victory. While pressing the attack on the three electric companies, they faced a small but angry split in their own ranks. Dissenters in the Building Trades Council and a few of its unions argued that labor's grievances against the progressive regimes of 1909-14 had turned the argument for municipal ownership on its head. What good was municipal ownership in the hands of a council and mayor who had caused the arrest of hundreds of peaceful picketers during the citywide strikes of 1910, had underpaid aqueduct workers and fed them bad food and had denied unionists influential city jobs? The final blow was the council's rebuff of a petition signed by thousands of workers for a ""living wage"" law. Was it not folly to reward labor's foes with control of the aqueduct's power? ??Union activists who favored the bonds conceded that the dissenters were correct in their assessment of ""progressive"" city government. But the progressive star was fading. What counted in the long run was whether Los Angeles could wrest the city's electric power system from the grasp of private utilities. The Central Labor Council's unions took this challenge to heart and voted, 60-4, for a resolution favoring the bonds. ??On its own, as well as in coalition with other groups, the labor movement marshaled its rank and file on behalf of public power. It turned out hundreds of poll-watchers and canvassers on election day. The pro-bond unions never did win over the dissenting faction; rather, they overwhelmed it at the polls. On May 8, 1914, L.A.'s voters emphatically endorsed the power bonds by a hefty 71%-29%, with the city's working-class wards providing by far the largest margin of victory. ??Within a year, Los Angeles sold its bonds and began buying out the three investor-owned utilities. The first public power flowed into local homes and businesses in 1916. Two decades later, the DWP eliminated the last of its private competition and consolidated the working-class legacy of kilowatt and water socialism that has served the city so well in the current energy crisis.

BODY: ??Natural disasters and crises can be devastating but are relatively simple and easy to grasp. A brush fire you fight with shovels. An earthquake, you clean up the rubble afterward and strengthen buildings in anticipation of the next. But California's energy crisis is far different and more complex. It's a quiet disaster on scattered, invisible fronts. Most people see it only when their own lights go out. ??There also is no precedent for this crisis in California and no accurate way to forecast how bad it can get, either the blackouts or the financial consequences. But as May approaches, it's certain that most Californians are not adequately informed about the severity of the problem or what they can do to limit its impact. ??Gov. Gray Davis, the utilities and others need to engage in a crash education program that will convince Californians of the seriousness of the problem and motivate them to undertake their own conservation programs in homes and businesses. California has been a pioneer in power conservation, and its citizens will listen to persuasive reasoning. ??As the chairwoman of the state Senate's Energy Committee, Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) deals with problems ranging from utility company insolvency to rate ""gaming"" by energy producers. ""But I'm really worried about this summer,"" she said last week, referring to the potential for day after day of rolling blackouts. She told of one businessman in her district who reported he will lose an estimated $ 30,000 every time his power is cut. Why not at least schedule blackouts so people can plan for them? she asked. Why not? ??In San Francisco, the Bay Area Economic Forum released a study indicating that power woes could deliver a $ 17-billion blow to the state's economy in lost production, the cost of rate increases and increased product prices. That may be conservative. The study did not include the $ 5.1 billion the state has spent so far to buy power for the insolvent private utilities. ??Republicans in the Legislature are stalling bills that would float a $ 10-billion revenue bond issue to finance power purchases and keep the state fiscally above water. They have latched onto a powerful issue, Davis' unwillingness to detail how he's spending the taxpayers' billions. Davis says he needs secrecy for competitive reasons as he bargains with power companies, though he is letting out a slightly wider trickle of figures. ??Wall Street, already wary about the credit-worthiness of the state, thinks poorly of the delay in issuing the bonds. Republicans should put a temporary hold on their battle with Davis and get the measure to the governor's desk this week. ??Lawmakers were slow in passing an $ 850-million conservation program, Bowen acknowledges. But Davis put the new program on a fast track Friday and made a smart choice in S.

BYLINE: RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER DATELINE: WASHINGTON BODY: ??So what if President Bush has opposed electricity price controls sought by California officials? Or that he has proposed cutting aid to states for incarcerating illegal immigrants convicted of crimes? Or that he has visited 26 states in his first 100 days in office--but not the most populous? ??Bush really does care about California, the White House insists, even if the state preferred Al Gore on election day. Administration officials said they have done a lot and plan to do more to lessen the electricity turmoil expected this summer. ??""I don't think he's treated California any differently than any other state,"" said Rep. George P. Radanovich (R-Mariposa). ??Some Californians feel otherwise. ??""The Bush administration's treatment of California started at indifference, moved to neglect and has now reached actual harm,"" complained Phil Schiliro, chief of staff for Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles). ??Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) has asked three times for a meeting with Bush to discuss the energy crisis. Her response from the White House: a form letter with her name misspelled. ??Bush has called for requiring public agencies to buy costly earthquake insurance, a measure opposed by California lawmakers of both parties. He has proposed cutting an earthquake preparedness program. And he provided no money in his proposed budget to clean up a pile of uranium processing waste in Utah leaking into the Colorado River. ??""That's our water supply,"" political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe said. ""What kind of message is that?"" ??John J. Pitney Jr., associate professor of government at Claremont McKenna College, said Bush's apparent indifference makes political sense. ??""It's hard to argue that Bush should spend any political capital in California,"" he said. ""The 2000 election suggested that he cannot carry the state no matter how hard he tries. The Republicans have already lost several House seats and have probably hit rock bottom. . . . From a purely political angle, there's little point in giving California any money or attention that could otherwise go to more competitive states, such as Florida."" ??But Jeffe, senior scholar at USC's School of Policy, Planning and Development, said Bush's failure to visit the state is hurting GOP efforts to rebuild itself in California. ""We are ground zero for the kind of Latino outreach that he said he wanted to do."" ??And veteran California Republican political strategist Kenneth L. Khachigian said Bush at least needs to prepare for the electricity problems predicted for summer. ??""If you get three or four days of successive blackouts, air conditioners going out, traffic lights going out, a second bankruptcy--whether he wants it or not--it's his problem,"" Khachigian said. ""It would be wise for him to have a proactive stance, not just reactive."" ??Tough Act to Follow ??Some political analysts have suggested that if Bush becomes too involved in California's troubles, what is now Democratic Gov. Gray Davis' problem could become Bush's. But, Khachigian said, ""there's a fine line between taking responsibility for a problem and claiming that California isn't part of the United States."" ??In dealing with heavily Democratic California, Bush has made this much clear: He is no Bill Clinton. ??Bush has a hard act to follow. When Clinton was president, he visited California often and rewarded it with federal largess. And California in return showered him with buckets of campaign dollars and electoral votes. ??But Rep. Ed Royce (R-Fullerton) said California will benefit from Bush's presidency too. ""As Californians bear a disproportionately higher tax burden, they stand to benefit greatly from the president's tax relief plan."" ??While House spokeswoman Claire Buchan assured that Bush will visit California soon. His wife already has done so. ??As proof that California is on their mind, administration officials point to the three Californians in the Cabinet--Ann M. Veneman of Agriculture, Norman Y. Mineta of Transportation and Anthony J. Principi of Veterans Affairs--and others in top White House jobs. ??Bush also has appointed California Latinos to high-level posts: Huntington Park Councilwoman Rosario Marin as treasurer, Los Angeles entrepreneur Hector V. Barreto Jr. as head of the Small Business Administration and former San Mateo County Supervisor Ruben Barrales as deputy assistant for intergovernmental affairs. ??Critics said that a Californian at the top does not guarantee that the Cabinet departments will develop California-friendly policies. The proposed Agriculture budget, for example, provides only $ 5 million--not the $ 15 million that California lawmakers said they need--to fight the glassy winged sharpshooter, an agricultural pest that threatens the state's wine industry. ??A spokesman for Veneman assured that additional funding will be considered, if requested by California lawmakers. And Rep. Mike Thompson (D-St. Helena), who assailed Bush for missing opportunities to help California, nonetheless expressed confidence in Veneman. ""She's going to keep pounding away to make sure that the California wine industry gets what it needs."" ??Some Good News ??Though he has proposed cuts in some programs that are important to California, Bush has taken some actions that please state officials. He has proposed a permanent research and development tax credit--an action that would particularly benefit Silicon Valley. ??His proposed budget includes additional money to crack down on illegal immigration and drug smuggling and unsafe trucks crossing into California from Mexico. And he has proposed increased funding to reduce backlogs at immigration offices. ??In one area, Bush even bested Clinton. He proposed $ 14 million to clean Lake Tahoe, more than the $ 3 million recommended by Clinton last year. ??And although he has drawn flak for proposing cuts in programs to promote energy efficiency and alternative fuels, his proposal to boost assistance to low-income families for insulating their homes and reducing their utility bills would nearly double California's allocation, to $ 8 million next year. ??No Bush policy has been more criticized in California than his approach to the state's energy woes--particularly his adamant opposition to price controls. Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Davis, said Bush and his aides ""got off to a strong start"" by extending federal orders sought by the state to keep power flowing into California. ??""Since then . . . they've been AWOL,"" Maviglio said. In a reference to price controls, he added: ""They're skirting around the edges of the problem without taking the bold action they need to take."" ??""The feds are the only ones who can step in and bring some sanity to the cost of electricity in California,"" Thompson said. ??Administration officials said they have taken steps ""from our first hours in office"" to address the energy crisis. They said they have responded favorably to all the state's requests except price controls, which Bush contends would discourage the building of power plants. ??While some seek to portray Bush's opposition to price controls as unsympathetic to California's plight, a number of California's House Republicans also oppose price controls. And even those who support them argue that the issue misses the larger point. ??Rep. Randy ""Duke"" Cunningham (R-San Diego), an advocate of price controls, nevertheless said: ""I agree with the administration that the state alone remains responsible for solving this crisis."" ??Added Rep. Mary Bono (R-Palm Springs): ""I don't believe Bush should bear the brunt of responsibility that the Clinton administration left over."" ??Tim Ransdell, executive director of the California Institute for Federal Policy Research, doubted that Bush would ignore California. ""California represents one-eighth of the nation. One in eight Americans can't be ignored.""

Economic Growth a Welcome Surprise: The U.S. economy grew at an unexpectedly strong 2% annual rate in the first three months of the year, thanks largely to buoyant shopping by American consumers. The gross domestic product--the country's total output of goods and services--expanded at twice the pace it did in the final three months of 2000 and at twice what analysts had expected, the government said Friday. Although many analysts said the economy remains balanced between strong growth and recession, economic optimists exulted over the report. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan added to the celebratory mood by saying that a key trend behind the economy's strong performance of the last decade--its ability to improve productivity--is likely to resume despite the current slowdown. ??(Peter Gosselin) ??* ??2. Stocks Rise on Good News: The GDP report boosted stock prices, which already had gotten a lift from better-than-expected home sales figures earlier in the week. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 117.70 to close at 10,810.05 on Friday, up 2.2% for the week, while the S&P 500 index climbed 18.53 to 1,253.05. The Nasdaq, which had fallen Thursday on concerns over weak technology profits, rose 40.80 to 2,075.68, finishing the week down 4.1%. Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 5.33% from 5.19%. ??(Times Staff Writer) ??* ??3. Power Crisis Zaps State Bond Rating; Price Controls OKd: The mounting cost to the state general fund of buying electricity for California consumers prompted Standard & Poor's Corp. to downgrade $ 25 billion of California's general obligation bonds. S&P lowered California's bond rating by two notches, to A-plus from AA. The move could add hundreds of millions of dollars to the state's borrowing costs, bond experts said. Separately, federal regulators approved a plan to control electricity prices in California during times of supply shortages. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission tied prices during power emergencies to the cost of natural gas and emission controls, among other things, with the least efficient generator setting the market price. Critics said the order contains loopholes that will allow market manipulation. ??(Nancy Rivera Brooks) ??* ??4. FTC Pans Music Industry Marketing: A much-anticipated sequel to last year's Federal Trade Commission report on the marketing of violent entertainment to children slammed the record industry for failing to heed regulators' recommendations. Though it gave some credit to the film and video-game industries for revising the way they marketed to young audiences, the FTC found the five major record conglomerates continued to advertise ""explicit-content"" albums on popular teen shows such as MTV's ""Total Request Live"" and BET's ""Top 10 Live."" Just before the release of the first report, the Recording Industry Assn. of America had blunted some of the criticism by introducing a policy against ads for such albums on TV shows or in publications whose audience is mostly 16 years old or younger. But the RIAA said it rescinded the policy in September. ??(Jeff Leeds) ??* ??5. Gas Prices Continue Upward Spiral: The average price of self-serve regular gasoline spurted higher again in California and around the nation on an increase in demand and a switch by refiners to the more costly summer gasoline blend required in parts of the country by air-quality regulations. Prices in California got an extra boost from a fire at a Los Angeles-area refinery owned by Tosco Corp. and by a change in Tosco's pricing strategy. In late March, Tosco increased wholesale prices to its dealers in Southern California and Arizona and tied prices to the cost of gasoline in the spot market. Some other major suppliers have begun matching the Tosco increase, market experts said. Some market watchers foresee gas at $ 3 a gallon or more. ??(Nancy Rivera Brooks) ??* ??6. General Dynamics Renews Newport News Bid: General Dynamics Corp. agreed to acquire Newport News Shipbuilding Inc. in a $ 2.1-billion deal that would create the nation's largest military shipbuilder and leave only one maker of U.S. aircraft carriers and submarines. The proposed merger, which the Pentagon had rejected two years ago, marks the latest in a renewed wave of consolidations in the defense industry and would again make General Dynamics one of the largest private employers in San Diego. General Dynamics executives said they are confident of receiving the necessary approvals because this time they will be dealing with the Bush administration, which may view the takeover differently. ??(Peter Pae) ??* ??7. Disney Earnings Beat Estimates: Walt Disney Co.'s second-quarter operating results exceeded Wall Street's expectations as the company's studio and consumer products units improved, although Disney did post a net loss stemming largely from a one-time charge related to the restructuring of its Internet portal. Disney also confirmed that it will shrink its venerable animation unit, with a union official estimating as many as 300 jobs of about 1,000 in Burbank could be cut. Separately, President Robert Iger confirmed that layoffs will be needed to reach Disney's previously announced goal of cutting 4,000 jobs companywide. Disney's studio and consumer products groups showed improved results in the quarter, while earnings were flat in its theme parks and softer in broadcasting. ??(James Bates) ??* ??8. New FCC Chief Vows Deregulation: Repudiating decades-old media ownership rules, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Michael K. Powell said he envisions a broad rollback of restrictions, which could bring about a tidal wave of consolidation. In his most candid remarks about the role of the FCC since taking office, Powell said he would move in early May to eliminate regulations that prevent one company from owning a newspaper and a television station in the same city. Powell also told broadcasters meeting in Las Vegas that Viacom Inc. was likely to prevail in its challenge of federal rules that prevent any broadcaster from owning stations that reach more than 35% of the nation's television viewers. ??(Sallie Hofmeister) ??* ??9. Ford Takes More Heat Over Explorer Tires: Ford Motor Co. came under the most direct criticism leveled against it yet regarding last year's massive Firestone tire recall. Two prominent consumer safety groups issued a report saying that the auto maker was largely to blame for accidents in which Ford Explorer sport-utility vehicles, equipped with Firestone tires, spun out of control after the tires lost their treads. Though they blamed Bridgestone/Firestone for producing tires prone to failure, Public Citizen and Safetyforum.com said Ford bore the bulk of the responsibility for dictating an insufficiently robust tire design and designing the Explorer so it would overly stress the tires and tip over too easily once a tire blew. ??(Terril Yue Jones) ??* ??10. American Airlines Sued Over Health Coverage: A flight attendant filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in Los Angeles, charging that American Airlines discriminated against some employees by refusing to offer insurance coverage for birth control, Pap tests and infertility treatments.

He just didn't believe that market manipulation by power companies could possibly be an important issue; it sounded too much to him like the sort of thing one hears from knee-jerk leftists, who blame greedy capitalists for every problem, be it third-world poverty or high apartment rents. The left has cried ""Wolf!"" so many times that sensible people have learned to discount such claims. ??But now a bona fide wolf has arrived, whose predatory behavior is doing terrible damage to our most populous state -- and nobody will believe it. ???True, California would be heading for a summer of power shortages even if it had never deregulated. And even if there was workable competition in the wholesale electricity market, prices in that market would spike during periods of peak demand, transferring billions of dollars from either taxpayers or consumers to the generators. ??But the evidence is now overwhelming that there isn't workable competition in California's power market, and that the actions of generators ""gaming the system"" have greatly magnified the crisis. The key fact is that California has somehow remained in a state of more or less continuous power shortage and very high wholesale prices regardless of the level of demand. A rash of outages has kept the electricity market conveniently -- and very profitably -- short of supply even during periods of low demand, when there ought to be lots of excess capacity. ??As Frank Wolak, the Stanford economist who also advises the state's power grid, has pointed out, an outage at a power plant is a lot like an employee calling in sick. You can't tell directly whether he is really sick or has chosen to take the day off for other reasons, but you can look for circumstantial evidence. And such evidence has convinced Mr. Wolak that ""generators use forced outages strategically to withhold capacity from the market"" -- a view shared by a growing number of other researchers. ??Which brings us to the latest move by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. On Wednesday, the commission apparently decided to offer California some relief, and put new price caps in place on the California electricity market. I say ""apparently"" because the more you look at the plan the less likely it seems to be any help at all. Indeed, the measure was passed on a 2-to-1 vote, with William Massey -- the one commissioner who has been sympathetic to calls for price controls -- voting against it on the grounds that it would be ineffectual. ??What's wrong with FERC's plan? First, it caps prices only in emergency conditions -- ignoring the fact that electricity prices have stayed at hard-to-explain levels even when there is no emergency. In effect, the plan is laid out as if the electricity market were really competitive, in spite of all the evidence that it is not. ??Second, even those emergency price caps are full of loopholes, offering extensive opportunities for what Mr. Wolak calls ""megawatt laundering"" -- selling power to affiliated companies that for one reason or another are exempted from the price controls (for example, the controls do not apply to ""imports"" from neighboring states), then selling it back into the California market. Severin Borenstein of the University of California Energy Institute adds that because the allowed price depends on the cost of generation at the least efficient plant, generators will have a clear incentive to produce inefficiently: ""I predict we will find some plants we never heard of before that are suddenly operating again, and they will be pretty inefficient."" ??The general verdict seems to be that this is not a serious plan. There are serious proposals to mitigate the crisis out there -- indeed, last fall Mr. Wolak submitted a proposal that was well received by other experts -- but FERC has ignored all of them. ??The charitable interpretation is that FERC still doesn't get it, that it just can't bring itself to believe that this time the wolf is real. The uncharitable interpretation is that last week's action was meant to fail. The Medley Report, an online newsletter, calls the FERC plan ""a grand exercise in posturing without substance . . . a very clever temporary move by the Bush administration to deflect any political fallout"" from the looming disaster. ??Whatever the explanation, the plain fact is that FERC and the administration have yet to offer California any significant relief. ??http://www.nytimes.com LOAD-DATE: April 29, 2001 of 103 DOCUMENTS ??????????????????Copyright 2001 McClatchy Newspapers, Inc.

A1; POWER CRUNCH LENGTH: 1323 words HEADLINE: Diesel plants spark concern They're expected to generate big air-quality problems when predicted summer blackouts hit. BYLINE: Chris Bowman and Stuart Leavenworth Bee Staff Writers BODY: ??When blackouts roll across California in the coming months - as captains of the crippled electricity grid say they surely will - tens of thousands of miniature powerhouses will whine, cough and rumble to the rescue. ??These backup plants will ignite the same fuel that powers locomotives, ships and 18-wheel trucks. And they'll be spewing the same pollution - only more so, because most are old, with little or no emissions controls. ??They are diesel-powered generators, the dirtiest of internal combustion engines. And unlike trucks and other vehicles, they've largely escaped 30 years of air pollution restrictions because they were intended only for emergencies, as when a storm or earthquake knocks out power. ??But, now, as a season of multiple planned blackouts appears imminent, many California businesses are expected to fire up the old stogies more often than was ever imagined. ??And the generators will kick in when their expelled gases can do the most harm. The hot weather that taxes air conditioners and drains electricity supplies also accelerates the conversion of engine exhaust to ozone gas, the ingredient in smog that inflames airways and impairs breathing. ??""That is why we think this is going to be the most challenging summer ever for air quality,"" said Luna Salaver, spokeswoman for the Bay Area Air Quality Management District, a nine-county region with thousands of unregulated standby generators. ??""On those hot days when we want people to stop driving and doing things that pollute the air, the generators will kick in, and air quality will worsen,"" Salaver said. ??No one knows how many diesel generators are scattered around the state at hospitals, universities, factories and businesses. But air districts report there are at least 641 in Sacramento; up to 5,000 in the Bay Area; 1,200 in the San Joaquin Valley; and thousands more in the smog-plagued valleys of Southern California. ??Some are relatively clean, particularly if they have been built or retrofitted in the last few years. But most are tiny pollution factories, and were intended only to be run for short periods following natural disasters. ??According to the state Air Resources Board, a typical diesel generator emits about 50 to 100 times more smog-forming compounds per unit of energy than a typical gas-fired power plant. When the plants run for hours, people downwind can get a heavy dose of the tiny, toxic particles contained in diesel exhaust. ??""Go down to the Greyhound bus station and have them turn on their engines and hang around there - that's what it's like,"" said Michael Scheible, deputy executive officer of the state Air Resources Board, which regulates engines and fuels. ??Environmentalists say generators should be cranked up only during power outages. But in recent months, farmers and manufacturers have pressured regulators to redefine an emergency and allow generators to be used well before a blackout is ordered. ??Business groups say regulators need to be sensitive to data centers, chip makers and other manufacturers that can't afford even a one-second interruption in power. ??""We would like some kind of statewide policy on when and where we can use the diesel generators,"" said Gino DiCaro, a spokesman for the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. ""Obviously, we would like to use them more than we can now."" ??""We need to basically let go of this air-quality issue,"" said Mike Jennings, a Fresno energy consultant whose clients include members of the food-processing and dairy industries. ??State air and energy regulators are pushing energy conservation as the best way to avoid power outages. Nonetheless, the California Energy Commission has been compiling a list of generators statewide to see how their use could be coordinated, a move that stirs hope from business groups. ??""Six months ago, nobody wanted to talk about this because diesel was a big, bad word,"" DiCaro said. ""Now, at least we have agencies like the Energy Commission and the Public Utilities Commission talking about how diesel generators can fit into our electrically unreliable world."" ??Environmentalists worry that, as the summer drags on, Gov. Gray Davis will allow unrestricted use of the diesels. ??So far, the governor's staff has ""held firm,"" said Gail Ruderman Feuer, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council, a national environmental group. ""But if blackouts start happening in a big way, they could change their tune."" ??Along with other forecasters, officials with the California Independent System Operator, manager of the state's electricity grid, expect a flurry of blackouts in coming months. The next two months could be critical, because most new power plants under construction won't go on line before July. In addition, California will be losing one of its largest generators of electricity today when one of two units at the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant is taken off-line for 35 days of scheduled refueling. ??""You should be ready for the worst-case scenario,"" said Del Evans, Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s head of power load management, at a media briefing last week. ??For sellers and makers of diesel generators, the gloomy predictions are a gold mine. Small businesses, farmers, manufacturers - all are rushing to buy generators before the blackouts hit. ??""We are busier than we have ever been,"" said Rob Bly, president of Tuban Industrial Products Co., which assembles about 300 generators a year at its plant in Sacramento. ""We are twice as busy as we were in the height of the Y2K madness."" ??Bly says the generators he makes are ""10 times cleaner"" than ones of a decade ago. Still, he acknowledges, diesel is diesel. ??""If you are a hospital and you want standby power, you can't use propane. The fire marshall won't let you,"" said Bly. ""That leaves you with just one thing, and that is diesel."" ??Responding to such concerns, state Sen. Rico Oller, R-Andreas, introduced a bill this year to exempt thousands of backup generators from pollution controls whenever any power alert is called. The bill, however, was blocked by a Senate committee, and environmentalists say air districts have already relaxed their rules enough. ??""One of the big concerns is the cancer risk,"" Ruderman Feuer said. Air board studies, she noted, have found that a person's lifetime cancer risk increases 50 percent if he or she lives near a big diesel generator that runs 250 hours a year. ??In January, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency allowed air districts to loosen their restrictions on generators. In turn, the South Coast Air Quality Management District extended the number of hours that diesel generators could be operated each year. The San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District went even further, allowing businesses to run generators when state power reserves drop to 1.5 percent or when the ISO predicts blackouts anywhere in the Valley. ??The Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District still requires businesses and public agencies to wait for blackouts before generators are fired up. Altogether, the district has permits for 641 generators, including major clusters at data centers and companies such as Intel. ??In the Bay Area, regulators are even more uncertain of what could happen this summer. Unlike other regions of the state, the Bay Area never required permits for diesel generators smaller than 250 horsepower. (In Sacramento, the threshold is 50 horsepower.) ??As a result, only 12 of the region's estimated 5,000 generators are subject to pollution controls. ??Salaver, the district's spokeswoman, said officials assumed the generators would be used only during earthquakes, and therefore didn't need any regulation. ??""Now, we find people are operating generators even if we are in a Stage Two alert,"" Salaver said. ""That is not what emergency generators are for."" ??* * * ??The Bee's Chris Bowman can be reached at (916) 321-1069 or cbowman@sacbee.com.

A1 LENGTH: 1544 words HEADLINE: Why Edison, PG&E split on strategy BYLINE: Dale Kasler Bee Staff Writer BODY: ??One utility was more entrepreneurial, accustomed to the rough-and-tumble of free markets - and apparently believed only a radical remedy would cure its ills. ??The other was a more political animal, conversant with the language of Sacramento - and confident that negotiations and compromise with state officials could fix its problems. ??Different cultures and different circumstances sent Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. on separate paths this month. Edison, run by a former president of the Public Utilities Commission, negotiated a rescue package with Gov. Gray Davis. PG&E, with fewer ties to government and possessed of an independent streak, walked away from Davis and straight into U.S. Bankruptcy Court. ??As California's energy crisis hurtles toward a summer of blackouts and higher rates, experts are debating which company found the best solution for digging its way out of billions in debt. ??""We now have two models; it'll be interesting to see who recovers the quickest,"" said Mitch Wilk, a former PUC president who is now an energy consultant in San Francisco. ??At first blush, Edison and PG&E had plenty in common. Both utilities were afflicted with the same problem: runaway wholesale electricity costs they weren't able to recover from customers because of a state-mandated rate freeze. Both had been teetering on the edge of bankruptcy since January, when their losses depleted their cash reserves and credit. ??But PG&E was far sicker financially than Edison. Its debts from the state's flawed deregulation scheme reached $6.6 billion vs. $3.5 billion for Edison. That's because Edison serves a smaller territory and has more long-term supply contracts, so it was buying far less electricity than PG&E on the horrendously expensive spot market. ??Faced with a comparatively manageable loss, Edison was receptive to selling its share of California's transmission grid to the state, a deal that would generate $2.76 billion. The proceeds, along with funds from a proposed long-term bond sale, would pay off Edison's debts, according to the terms of the deal. ??Although PG&E says it was willing to sell its transmission lines, too, there was a crucial difference in the two companies' backgrounds that ultimately would influence their approach to the financial crisis. ??Unlike Edison, PG&E is a natural gas company as well as an electric company. PG&E, a subsidiary of PG&E Corp., had survived the bruising wars of natural gas deregulation in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The experience took PG&E out of the cozy world of the regulated monopoly - in which the utility had exclusive rights to its service territory but was subject to state price controls - and into the world of competition. ??The experience gave PG&E more of a free-market bent, said a former PUC staffer who requested anonymity. ??So even though Davis' aides say the governor offered PG&E a plan that would have paid off its debts - including $3 billion to $4 billion for its share of the grid - the utility balked at a key provision. While the original deregulation called for the cap on customer prices to end in 2002, Davis was insisting the utility remain regulated for a decade. ??PG&E wanted an immediate end to Public Utilities Commission regulation, and would agree only to a cursory review of rates through ""a jury-rigged arbitration,"" Davis said last week. ??""I believe PG&E was in denial,"" Davis said in an interview with Bee editors and reporters. ??PG&E says it wasn't demanding an end to regulation. Rather, what it wanted - and what Davis' negotiator Michael Peevey agreed to in principle - was to let the utility charge ratepayers for all its costs of buying wholesale electricity, said PG&E spokesman Ron Low. ??In that same deal, reached Feb. 25 in Los Angeles, PG&E made a ""handshake agreement"" to sell its transmission grid, Low said. He wouldn't reveal the price. ??In the weeks that followed, the governor's team reneged, Low said. ""The discussions and negotiations broke down because they would not agree to the basic principles that were reached by (PG&E Chairman) Bob Glynn and Michael Peevey,"" Low said. ??PG&E also became disgusted with a series of PUC rulings in late March and early April that it believed would seriously hinder its ability to recover its debts. ??Things came to a head April 5 when Davis proposed a rate increase and outlined his rescue plan in a televised address. A few minutes later, Joseph Fichera, a Wall Street financier advising Davis, and other Davis advisers held a conference call in which they fleshed out the details for investors. Edison officials and directors listened in, but PG&E didn't, Fichera said. ??""They had made up their minds,"" Fichera said, referring to PG&E officials. ??The next morning, with Glynn dismissing Davis' speech as ""a lot of words,"" the utility filed for bankruptcy protection. ??That afternoon, Davis called PG&E ""selfish"" and pointedly went into a negotiating session with John Bryson, the chairman and chief executive of Edison's parent Edison International. ??For Davis, the meeting was crucial. Although Edison had tentatively agreed in February to sell its transmission lines, the deal wasn't sewn up and Davis was nervous the PG&E bankruptcy would prompt Edison's creditors to ""jerk Edison into bankruptcy,"" Davis said last week. ??That afternoon, ""conceptually we reached an agreement,"" Davis said. The deal was announced the following Monday. ??Consumer advocates and some legislative leaders blasted the agreement as a giveaway, and said Davis hastily sweetened the terms for Edison because he needed to show progress on the energy crisis in the wake of the PG&E imbroglio. ??Not true, Davis said; the basic terms were already on the table before PG&E filed for bankruptcy. Either way, Edison was receptive to negotiating with Davis. ??Edison's background is different from PG&E's. Because it isn't in the natural gas business, it doesn't have the track record PG&E does with free markets. It is more comfortable in the regulatory and political realm, experts say. ??Notably, Bryson was president of the PUC in the 1970s - when Davis was Gov. Jerry Brown's chief of staff. ??""He knows Gray Davis,"" said ex-PUC President Wilk. ""He may feel a higher level of comfort in dealing with a very adversarial process. He felt he could rely on the governor."" ??Politically savvy, Edison is one of the utility industry's biggest contributors to national political campaigns, and it usually spends more than PG&E on California campaigns. Edison International's board of directors includes Los Angeles attorney Warren Christopher, the former U.S. secretary of state and an elder statesman of the Democratic Party. ??Though it's open to negotiations, Edison isn't a pussycat. To the contrary, experts say. ??""It was usually Edison that was more combative than PG&E,"" said Tom Willoughby, a retired PG&E lobbyist. ??Wilk agreed, adding: ""I find it curious that PG&E's being painted as the confrontational, aggressive company and Edison as the get-along, company."" ??Edison hasn't been shy about going to Sacramento for favors; last year, for example, Edison wanted some changes made in the operation of the state's power grid. Instead of talking to the grid manager, the Independent System Operator, Edison went to the Legislature, a source said. Lawmakers then pressured the ISO to make the changes. ??One more factor may have played into Edison's willingness to deal with the governor. ??Last year it became involved in a protracted dispute with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees the transmission grid, over how much profit Edison could earn from the grid. ??Edison eventually won its point, but the case influenced the utility's thinking when Davis offered to buy the grid. According to industry consultant Barbara Barkovich, Edison figured, why wrestle with the federal government over profits when it simply could raise billions through a cash sale? ??Besides, Edison has a back-up plan if the Legislature scraps the grid purchase, as many lawmakers have threatened. The company has said it would follow PG&E's lead and file for bankruptcy. ??But its willingness to negotiate with the governor will have served it well, even if it goes into bankruptcy, said Nancy Day, a utility industry veteran consulting for the Legislature. ??Day said she believes the governor's appointees on the PUC will ""punish"" PG&E for its behavior. If Edison winds up in bankruptcy court, it ""won't be punished for it,"" Day said. ??PUC President Loretta Lynch couldn't be reached for comment. ??Energy companies at a glance Edison Main subsidiary: Southern California Edison Headquarters: Rosemead, Los Angeles County Customers: 4.2 million in Southern California Chairman: John Bryson Performance: Lost $1.94 billion in 2000 on revenue of $11.72 billion Stock ticker symbol: EIX ??PG&E Main subsidiary: Pacific Gas and Electric Co.

BYLINE: Dan Walters BODY: ??No one knows for certain how - or when - California's energy crisis will conclude. It is an inordinately complicated four-dimensional chess game that has so far defied politicians' simplistic - perhaps simple-minded - efforts at resolution. ??That said, one may speculate reasonably on the financial, social and political consequences for California in the months and years ahead. ??Financially, Californians - especially the 70 percent who are served by private electric utilities - will feel the pinch for years, if not decades, to come. Before the crisis hit, California's power rates were already among the highest in the nation. Given the nearly $20 billion in power purchase debts that the utilities and the state have accumulated so far, the stubbornly high wholesale prices and other data, it's not unreasonable to project that Californians in private utility areas will see their rates double, or rise even higher. ??Politicians have been laying the rhetorical groundwork for big increases, although they've been disingenuous about the outer parameters. The burden will fall most heavily on business customers and, coupled with doubts about power reliability and rising natural gas prices, will damage the state's ability to attract job-creating investment. States with low and stable energy prices already are using the crisis as a recruiting tool. In February, Intel President Craig Barrett told the Wall Street Journal: ""As long as California is a Third World country, we won't build $2 billion manufacturing plants here."" ??The inevitable escalation of utility rates will create distortions within the state as well, since utility rates for the 30 percent of Californians served by publicly owned utilities are not likely to rise by more than token amounts. The municipal utilities' rates were roughly a third lower than private utilities' rates prior to the crisis. By the time the dust settles, they may be just half as much. It will contribute to the balkanization of California that was already being defined by such factors as housing prices, ethnicity and income levels. Low-cost regions will become magnets for people and jobs while high-price regions will be shunned. ??The energy crisis will certainly be the defining issue of the 2002 elections, and perhaps for others to follow. Gov. Gray Davis' popularity has plummeted since he took charge of the crisis, laying waste to his intentions to seek an easy re-election next year as a middle-of-the-road, business-friendly, tough-on-crime education reformer. ??With his popularity waning, Davis may be compelled to turn left, shoring up his base by catering to demands of labor unions, environmentalists, trial lawyers and other liberal elements of the Democratic Party. That, in turn, would undermine the triangulating strategy he has pursued, in which he took Democratic voters for granted and cultivated business executives and social conservatives. Business interests are worried, for example, that Davis may now feel compelled to sign union-friendly legislation, such as boosts in workers' compensation and unemployment benefits, that he vetoed in the past. ??Davis' relations with fellow Democrats in the Legislature have turned from cool to poisonous, with lawmakers openly trashing his leadership and management of the energy crisis and worrying that he'll try to shift the blame to them if the crisis turns to disaster. If Democratic leaders fear that voters will be in a throw-the-bums-out mood next year, they may throttle back on intentions to maximize their party strength in drawing new legislative districts. Such maximization would require spreading Democratic voters out among many districts, and such margin-thinning could make Democrats vulnerable in an energy crisis-spawned voter rebellion. Democrats may well strive for fewer but safer seats. ??These are but a few of the potential effects that California will experience long after the immediate crisis has faded, whenever that may be. ??* * * ??The Bee's Dan Walters can be reached at (916) 321-1195 or dwalters@sacbee.com.

D1 LENGTH: 1419 words HEADLINE: The energy crisis is good for you SOURCE: Insight Senior Writer BYLINE: Louis Freedberg BODY: Here's a message for pampered and overindulged citizens of the Golden State who complain unceasingly about high energy bills and the day-to-day prospect of rolling blackouts: Stop whining. ???It's not a crisis -- it's an opportunity. The energy ""crisis"" is good for us. ???For decades, we burned lights whenever we wanted, bought more and more energy-guzzling appliances, bigger and bigger television sets. Today, as citizens of the richest state in the world's only superpower, who is going to tell us when to stop? ???""We talk about having to hit mules over the head with a 2 by 4 to get their attention, but I don't think human beings are much more responsive or foresighted. I hate to see people suffering, but on the other hand, if that is the way we learn, so be it,"" says Ernest Callenbach, the Berkeley author of the futuristic 1975 novel, ""Ecotopia."" Callenbach's work was a major influence on the alternative energy policies of former Gov. Jerry Brown. ???Nowhere has the ethic of unlimited consumption been more out of control than in the Bay Area, where the energy demands of high tech outstripped what the electricity grid could supply. Aside from the energy needs of the industry itself, the wealth it generated encouraged avaricious lifestyles that include power-swilling mansions and freeways clogged with monster sport utility vehicles. ???Perhaps the 34 days of blackouts some experts predict for this summer will bring the discipline that eludes us. Except for the hardships the crisis has inflicted on the poor, Californians still enjoy a sybaritic lifestyle that, in ways, would put to shame the pharaohs of Egypt or the court of Louis XIV. Lights still burn when they're not needed. Except for very occasional blackouts, electricity still flows 24 hours a day. Our daily routines have barely been affected. A visitor from another state or country would have a hard time finding signs of our highly publicized ""crisis."" ???As we brace for deregulated electric bills courtesy of the state Public Utilities Commission, imagine what life was like for Native Americans who lived for millennia in a bounteous Bay Area without microwaves, waffle irons, air conditioning or 24-cubic-foot refrigerators. No one is suggesting that we revert to those days. But let's consider the thought that we may actually be better off without the piles of appliances whose tangle of cords clogs our homes and offices. ???Smug Californians love to point to the state's ranking as a miserly consumer of energy -- only three other states consume less per capita -- to rebut accusations that we have become greedy energy hogs. Tougher efficiency standards have helped, but so has our great weather. ""California has a uniquely good climate to be efficient,"" says Dan Kammen, director of the Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley. ""Compared to countries with much harsher climates, we have not done enough."" ???There's no denying the sudden, sharp pain caused by the crisis -- from threats of sky-high electric bills to fears that California's economic engine is near collapse. But if we handle it right, all kinds of positive energy will result. Potential benefits extend from the spiritual (a revival of the conservation ethic) to the curative (making the state immune to power-problem overloads) to the liberating (throwing off for good our dependence on the Texas energy overlords). ???Consumers, shocked into action by tripled or quadrupled energy bills, are already rushing to Bay Area hardware stores, snapping up setback thermostats, hot water heater blankets, insulating window film and outdoor clotheslines. Alan Ginsberg of Satco Products in Hayward, who imports from China container-loads of squiggly shaped energy-saving fluorescent bulbs, says, ""They're flying out the door."" ???More significantly, the crisis impels the state to move ahead with the construction of badly needed power plants. It puts on the agenda of public debate the fundamental question of whether our energy system should be in the hands of giant utilities or run by municipalities or by the state. It certainly unveiled the greed of out-of-state energy producers who have sucked billions of dollars from California. ???The crisis has also made us focus on fundamental flaws in our energy grid, such as the 4,500-megawatt electricity shortage that emerged in the 1990s while we were all reveling in California's boom times. ???By exposing those who got us into this predicament -- producers, utilities, regulators and politicians -- there's a chance we'll get out of it with a more rational and efficient energy grid and be better prepared to deal with challenges down the road. If that happens, Gov. Gray Davis might yet confound critics who say his political prospects are sinking faster than you can say ""megawatt."" ???The ease and convenience of modern life fools us into thinking that power, water and food are infinite. Flip a switch and the lights magically go on. Turn a faucet and water flows. These days, the biggest challenge in gathering our daily bread is the hunt for a space in the supermarket parking lot. ???And we want it all, leading us straight into denial. We want instant, abundant power -- but we don't want any new power plants, especially in our backyards. Coal is dirty. Natural gas is expensive. Dams kill salmon. Nuclear power? Forget about it. The contradictions haven't mattered -- so long as an endless supply of electrons flowed from our wall outlets. But that mindless ease, the crisis taught us, is history. ???The energy crisis warns us that we must become more self-sufficient or risk slipping toward oblivion if we continue to spend billions of dollars on shrinking non-renewable energy sources such as coal and natural gas. ???The Roman Empire fell because of the decadence of its ruling elites. And the British empire, dependent on raw materials from the colonies, began to collapse when it became too expensive to import goods across oceans. ???A new consciousness about where electricity comes from is the first step toward using less of it. It could also translate into a greater awareness of other environmental causes. ???If we get the message, ""the net outcome (of the energy crisis) will be a quite profound shift in consciousness in energy conservation,"" predicts Michael Lerner, executive director of Commonweal, a health and environmental institute in Bolinas. ???Such a turnaround is no snap. ???During the last energy crisis in the 1970s, there was a similar rush toward conservation. President Jimmy Carter installed solar panels on the White House roof. President Ronald Reagan took them down. He also phased out tax credits and other inducements to encourage development of renewable energy sources. ???Closer to home, one of former Gov. George Deukmejian's first acts was to abolish the Office of Appropriate Technology established by Gov. Jerry Brown to move us away from our dependence on non-renewable fossil fuels. ???Since then, we have regressed further. Even record high gasoline prices have done nothing to depress the sales of SUVs, which now account for the largest share of automobile and light truck sales (20 percent at last count). ???But today's crisis could lead to permanent changes in behavior, if only because the technology needed to harness sun, wind and other renewable energy sources has become far more cost effective than a generation ago. California already gets 12 percent of its energy from these ""alternative"" sources, and the market incentives to develop them further has never been higher. ???Stratospherically high electricity bills could finally force on us the technological changes and the discipline that Europeans -- who use two-thirds as much energy per capita as we do -- and the Japanese -- who use only half as much -- have had to embrace. ???This difficult moment in California's history has already yielded some ecological epiphanies, like those experienced by Ernest Callenbach's neighbors. They installed solar photovoltaic cells on their roof. The installation now puts surplus electricity back into the energy grid, instead of sucking more out of it. ???""The magical moment is the idea that by having a photovoltaic cell on your roof, you can make your electric meter run backward,"" said Callenbach. ""Instead of it going to the right, you actually see it going in the other direction. You say to yourself, 'Oh Lord, Oh Lord, I have seen the future.'

Gray Davis is continuing to tell Californians that he's on top of the state's energy crisis and, as he said at one gathering last week, ""in three years this problem will be a distant memory."" Fat chance. All major aspects of the situation are growing worse, not better, minute-by-minute. ??Politicians took over the crisis in January as the state's major utilities exhausted their cash reserves and lines of credit. Davis began what he said then would be a short-term, emergency program of power purchases to keep electrons flowing into homes and businesses. ??From that moment forward, the situation has steadily deteriorated, moving toward a three-pronged disaster: severe summer blackouts, the bankruptcy of the utilities and sharply escalating power bills. With the bankruptcy filing by Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and decisions by Davis and the Public Utilities Commission to begin ratcheting up utility rates, two of the three negative scenarios are now in place. And everyone involved in the crisis expects blackouts this summer as demands for power soar and supplies dwindle. ??The Davis strategy, if there is one, is to continue the state's massive power purchases while negotiating longer-term and presumably cheaper supply contracts, encourage conservation, help utilities pay off their debts by selling their intercity transmission system to the state and tapping ratepayers, and build more power plants to ease the supply crunch. ??Currently, the governor is touting his deal with Edison International, parent company of Southern California Edison, to sell its portion of the grid and is working on a similar deal with Sempra, the parent of San Diego Gas and Electric. But PG&E's bankruptcy casts doubt on the viability of the cash-for-grid concept and legislators, particularly Davis' fellow Democrats, are very skeptical of the Edison deal. ??Clearly, Davis rushed into the Edison deal just three days after PG&E filed bankruptcy, in hopes of erasing the political stain of the latter action, but its provisions are being labeled a ""bailout"" by critics. It places only a token financial burden on Edison International while guaranteeing the profitability of its utility subsidiary by charging its customers whatever is required to cover its costs and past debts. ??Meanwhile, the state is spending -- by Davis' own account -- about $70 million a day or $2-plus billion a month on spot power purchases, paying roughly five times what consumers are being charged at the retail level. And the current futures market for power indicates that wholesale power prices will jump by another 50 percent by mid-summer; higher prices and greater purchases could increase the drain on the state treasury to as much as $5 billion a month. ??State Treasurer Phil Angelides is desperately trying to arrange a ""bridge loan"" to relieve pressure on the state's rapidly vanishing reserves, but Wall Street is reluctant to lend without a fuller explanation of what's happening and a specific authorization from a suspicious Legislature. ??He said Tuesday that Davis, who has maintained secrecy on power purchases, must offer a comprehensive and public plan for dealing with the financial squeeze. ??Meanwhile, bankers are sending strong signals that the state government is becoming as poor a lending risk as the utilities. ??Davis, for some reason, is unwilling to declare this situation the emergency that it is truly becoming -- one that could take a toll of human life if major blackouts shut down air conditioners, respirators and traffic lights. He insists on issuing his periodic -- and wholly unrealistic -- assurances that things will turn out all right, even declaring to reporters this past Tuesday that ""we think we'll have this thing licked by the end of fall."" ??It's time for someone -- the governor, preferably, but someone -- to lay out for Californians exactly what's happening, the downside financial and power supply risks, and what's being done to deal with the looming disaster facing this state. ??It's time for politicians to treat us as adults who can face reality, not as children to be fed sugarcoated sound bites and slogans. ??-- Dan Walters writes for the Sacramento Bee.

BYLINE: NANCY VOGEL and MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Two top state energy officials said Friday that a federal plan to stabilize electricity prices in California could increase the odds of blackouts this summer and most likely is illegal. ??In a barrage of complaints attacking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the state's top power regulator and the head of the board overseeing California's transmission grid said they might challenge the federal order in court. ??The order was approved on a 2-1 vote Wednesday and released to the public late Thursday. ??""We're going to take whatever actions we can to oppose this to the extent our lawyers tell us it's illegal,"" said Michael Kahn, an attorney named by Gov. Gray Davis to head the board overseeing the California Independent System Operator. Cal-ISO manages the transmission grid reaching three-quarters of the state. ??In a conference call with reporters, Kahn and Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, said the order also seems to indicate that FERC is unwilling to force power sellers to rebate any of the extraordinary profits earned before last October in California's market, where wholesale electricity prices began soaring last May. ??And, according to Kahn, the federal order illegally ties limits on power prices to a requirement that California link its transmission grid with those of other states. ??""It's not within their authority to have this kind of linkage,"" he said. ??The federal order is scheduled to take effect May 29. Though it is not clear how the order will play out in the state's electricity market, Lynch and Kahn said they do not believe it will bring down power costs or help the state avoid blackouts, as intended. ??""They're creating a whole new, wholesale blackout system,"" said Lynch, referring to a section of the order that allows large customers, such as steel mills and food processors, to get paid to shut down when grid operators are struggling to find enough electricity to meet demand. ??Though a somewhat similar program has helped California avoid blackouts, the federal order requires state power buyers to name the price to which electricity must rise before they shut down customers. ??The requirement of naming a price could lead to more blackouts, said Stanford University economist Frank Wolak, because it prevents power buyers from paying more if that's what it takes to keep electricity flowing. ??""Stating your price and sticking to it means that somebody could call your bluff,"" Wolak said. ""The generators just say, look, we can't supply all you want at the price you want to pay. ??""So they supply everything they can at the price we're willing to pay--and no more--and we have rotating blackouts,"" he said. ??Lynch said that no matter how this aspect of the FERC order unfolds, ""it ain't for Washington bureaucrats to decide when the lights go out in California. "" ??Grid operators at Cal-ISO must quickly buy batches of electricity to constantly match supply and demand on the transmission system serving most of the state, excluding the city of Los Angeles. When Cal-ISO cannot find enough power, it must order Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric and San Diego Gas & Electric to trigger rotating blackouts. ??The state suffered such controlled outages on four days in January and March, and many such days are predicted for this summer as air conditioning drives up demand for power. ??In other energy news Friday, Gov. Gray Davis announced in Los Angeles that electricity use in California state office buildings dropped by an average of 20% in the first two months of this year, compared to the same months of 2000. State workers have been under orders since late last year to turn off nonessential lights, computers, printers and other electrical appliances. Some agencies have even changed workers' schedules, eliminating ""flextime"" so that everyone works the same hours and the offices can open later and close earlier, shortening the energy-using day. ??* ??Times staff writer Mitchell Landsberg in Los Angeles contributed to this story.

BACKERS SAY PLAN WOULD BOOST SUPPLY, BUT FOES SEE IT COSTING CALIFORNIA DEARLY. BYLINE: JULIE TAMAKI and MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??A Texas congressman plans to introduce legislation next week that would allow California's small power producers to sell their supplies on the wholesale market--a move that could threaten Gov. Gray Davis' plan to end the state's energy crisis. ??The proposal by Republican Rep. Joe Barton, the influential chairman of the House energy and air quality subcommittee, would permit producers of alternative and renewable energy to suspend their contracts with the state's two biggest investor-owned utilities and sell their supplies to a third party. ??Proponents say the bill could dramatically bolster the state's electricity supplies by luring producers whose plants have been shut down by payment disputes to restart them in time for summer, when supplies are expected to be tight and blackouts are feared. ??But allowing producers to sell to a third party would essentially devastate Davis' plan to rescue the utilities and get the state out of the business of making emergency electricity purchases. ??The governor's plan is based on California locking down the costs of electricity from the utilities and small power producers for several years, at a reduced cost. ??During that time, the state would buy the remaining portion of the electricity the utilities need to serve their customers. Meanwhile, the utilities would regain their financial footing by selling assets to the state in exchange for being allowed to recover a portion of their back debt through a surcharge on electricity bills. ??If the alternative producers were allowed to sell their power on the wholesale market, the state could be forced to purchase much more electricity on the expensive open market. ??That would dramatically increase California's already massive power costs, forcing the state to further raise electricity rates and borrow even more than the record $ 12 billion in bonds it is planning to finance the plan. The state has spent more than $ 5 billion buying electricity that the utilities cannot afford, and Davis expects to spend $ 15 billion by year's end. ??""It is a way of busting the budget for the state of California,"" said Joseph Fichera, a Wall Street energy consultant hired by the Davis administration. He called the potential release of the small producers a ""disaster scenario"" for the state. ??Added Stephen E. Frank, chairman, president and chief executive of Southern California Edison: ""Releasing them from their contractual obligations will simply exacerbate the problem, because they would then be selling into the market at additionally higher rates and just compound the state's problems."" ??But Eugene Peters of the Electric Power Supply Assn. disputed that contention. The state, he said, is already buying replacement supplies on the open market because of reduced output by small producers. ??""If 3,000 megawatts are made available again, it will have a potentially profound effect on what people pay for power by bolstering overall electricity supplies,"" Peters said. ??Utility executives contend that only 1,200 megawatts are offline because of payment problems. ??California is home to nearly 700 small energy producers, which generate more than a quarter of the electricity consumed in the state. They differ from their big out-of-state counterparts, which have been getting paid by the state. ??The Barton proposal will be the subject of public hearings Tuesday and Thursday, and could move to the full House Energy and Commerce Committee for a vote the next week. Barton could not be reached for comment Friday. ??The alternative-energy provision is one of several in his emergency energy bill. Others designed to help the West through a difficult summer of price spikes and energy shortages range from offering federal aid to relieving a bottleneck in the transmission system to permitting governors to secure waivers from environmental rules to boost power supplies. ??The provisions dealing with waivers of environmental rules have been among the most controversial, drawing opposition from environmentalists. ??* ??Times staff writer Richard Simon in Washington contributed to this story.

BYLINE: Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer BODY: ??From the shipwreck of California's electric industry, Albert Vera sees a chance to build a life raft. ??""This is an opportunity that shall never come again,"" the former Culver City mayor told city and county officials gathered this week in Sacramento. ??Every rate hike, every blackout, every corporate bonus is more evidence for believers that it's time for local government to get into the power business. They pin their hopes on municipal utility drives in San Francisco, Corona, San Diego County and beyond. ??Over the past few years, however, only a handful of cities have set up their own electric departments, and they are mostly limited entities that fall short of full-fledged utilities. More commonly, cities - including Davis, Lincoln and Culver City - have studied the idea and rejected it, at least temporarily. ??They all face the same question, said Santa Rosa City Manager Jeffrey Kolin: ??""Is the investment worth the risk? Most of us would say we don't know yet."" ??Kolin's city, like scores of others across the state, has decided it is time to study the issue anew, motivated by the prospect of soaring electric bills, repeated blackouts, and Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s bankruptcy filing. ??""All their citizens are screaming,"" said Yvonne Hunter, a lobbyist for the League of California Cities. ??The highest visibility fight will likely come in November, when San Franciscans go to the polls to decided whether to create their own utility in a city that houses PG&E's corporate headquarters. ??""We will take it very seriously,"" PG&E spokesman John Nelson said. ??Shortly after deregulation in 1996, several drives for ratepayer-owned utilities stumbled or stalled. An effort in the far north state to create a multicounty public power agency was rejected by state regulators because some local governments objected. ??Now, with a bill to create a state power authority moving through the Legislature, some believe the climate may be changing. ??""One of the things this crisis has proved is the value of local control,"" said Jerry Jordan, head of the California Municipal Utilities Association. ??Since January, the cities of Hercules in the Bay Area and Corona in Southern California have formed utilities to deliver electric service to new neighborhoods - a strategy that sidesteps potential condemnation fights with the existing utility. The county of San Diego is trying to get special legislative authority to create a regional power agency without a popular vote. ??""We could produce power better, cheaper and faster than the private sector,"" county Supervisor Dianne Jacob said. ??Not so, say PG&E and Southern California Edison. ??""There's been much more talk of it, but as soon as most folks sit down and take a look at the realities ... they realize that they would have to buy on the same market, at the same outrageous prices that we and the state have been paying,"" Nelson said. ""The talk quickly evaporates."" ??For-profit utilities have long argued that government shouldn't usurp the role of private industry in delivering electricity. PG&E contends that the factors that once made public power attractive - such as access to low-cost electricity from federal dams - have evaporated. ??In addition, cities that try to withdraw from PG&E or Edison now probably would still have to funnel money their way for years to come, to pay off still-unsold state bonds that will stretch out a single year's power costs for up to 15 years. ??With so many unknowns, the next few years are likelier to produce more studies than new utilities, said a number of city officials who attended a seminar in Sacramento this week, sponsored in part by the American Public Power Association. ??Former New York state Sen. Al Coppola told the group the session should have been titled: ""Independence from the greedy robber baron utilities."" ??Public power backers share three key beliefs: ??* They can charge customers less because they don't have to pay dividends to investors or pay taxes on their sales; they can respond to local preferences on issues like which customers pay the lowest rates and how blackouts are staged; and existing utilities will do everything in their power to oppose them. ??""Edison did the right thing - (use) fear,"" to discourage Culver City from creating an electric arm in 1995, Vera, the city's former mayor, told the group. ??And Glenn Prentice, head of the newly created Corona electric utility, said in an interview that a half-dozen other cities have contacted him for more information, but he declined to name them. ??""If I do, Edison will start the attack on them. We're talking about a lot of money,"" he said. ""We're here to serve the public. They're here to make money."" ??PG&E sees new utilities as ""competition for our business,"" and it has a policy of lobbying hard against them, Nelson said. ??Less than 18 months ago, it warned residents of the Placer County town of Lincoln that a city power enterprise would be costlier and less dependable than PG&E, and its officials labeled the effort a ""tax dodge."" ??But by January of this year, PG&E barely blinked when Hercules set up a utility to deliver power and telecommunications service in new neighborhoods. ??""We got more resistance from AT&T and PacBell,"" said Raj Pankhania, assistant to the city manager of Hercules. ??Pankhania has been researching utility drives across the state and has seen no groundswell for public power, although he believes it can bring cities added revenue and more local control. ??That could change this summer, Prentice said. ??""It really depends on how bad the blackouts are."" ??A blackout that left one city councilmember's daughter at a darkened school was part of what led the Riverside County city of Corona to vote April 4 to form its own electric arm, he said. Heavy industry became anxious, too. ??""They said to the city council, 'Do something!' "" Prentice said. ??Skipping detailed studies, Corona quickly decided to create a utility that will build small power plants, under 50 megawatts, to serve city operations and new neighborhoods in the city of 127,000 east of Disneyland. ??In time, said Hercules' Pankhania, cities like his could become the living laboratory for whichever system can deliver better service and lower rates. ??Hercules' plans calls for the older two-thirds of its homes and businesses to retain their PG&E service and the newest third to be served by the city utility. ??""The existing homeowner will definitely compare five to 10 years down the road,"" he said. ""Then let the people decide which way they want to go."" ??* * * ??The Bee's Carrie Peyton can be reached at (916) 321-1086 or cpeyton@sacbee.com. LOAD-DATE: April 29, 2001

Subject:: Follow Up On California Information
Body:: Just following up on the Monday conference call discussion yesterday with Rick and others about nailing down the numbers and documentation so we can feed the Hill information on the mistakes Governor Davis made last year and this year on power supply contracts. As I understand it, there are two aspects of this: 1. The offer of Enron and others last year to sell power to California utilities for 5 cents per kw. Failure to accept these offers resulted in higher power costs in the range of $15 billion, as I recall from yesterday's call. 2. The long term contracts that California signed this year after taking actions and making statements that drove up the forward price curves are now under water to the tune of $20 billion. On both counts we will be pressed for assumptions and documentation to pursue these arguments, which parallel the comments made by senior management in Capitol Hill meeting last week. We will work on back up on this end, but we would greatly appreciate your assistance in this regard as well. With Congress out of session starting COB on Thursday, we will need information pulled together by tomorrow COB to get the final product in the hands of congressional types and others who can use it on a timely basis. Thanks.

Davis's Plan To Power California --- State's Outlays for Electricity May Be Hard to Recover Without Rate Increases --- Betting on Long-Term Deals ------------------------ Breakthrough made in rescue of PG&E State ready to pay $7 billion for lines By Steve Geissinger SACRAMENTO BUREAU SACRAMENTO -- Signaling a breakthrough in secret energy crisis talks, the Davis administration disclosed Tuesday it may announce the framework of a pact to rescue the teetering Pacific Gas and Electric Co. next week. ""Things are going very well,"" said Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis. The state appears to be poised to pay at least $7 billion -- and possibly billions more -- for PG&E's high-voltage transmission lines as part of a deal to financially renovate the north-state utility, according to sources familiar with the negotiations. But consumer advocates insisted that even the $7 billion price is too much to pay. And experts warned that a deal with PG&E will be more complex than with other utilities. PG&E representatives declined comment, in keeping with their policy on the talks, even though the Davis administration said an announcement could come as early as next week or the following week. The new timetable for an announcement was substantially sooner than in Davis' original forecast. Until late last week, PG&E was still resisting the sale of its power grid despite the fact that Davis had announced the framework of an agreement with Southern California Edison. Davis expects to soon announce a similar deal with the San Diego Gas and Electric Co. However, any such deal still would need federal approval. The investor-owned utilities, trapped between high wholesale costs and lower, regulated retail rates, amassed nearly $13 billion in debts and were unable to buy electricity this winter. With the onset of rolling blackouts, the state began brokering billions of dollars in emergency short- and long-term power purchases. Davis' strategy to ease the energy price and supply crisis includes bolstering both conservation and generation while fiscally refurbishing the nearly bankrupt utilities. As part of the rescue deal, the utilities would have to drop legal actions seeking dramatically higher electricity bills, environmentally shield wildlands they own, sell power from their generators to Californians for the next decade and secure help with their debts from their parent companies. Together with the cash infusion from the sale of their power 26,000-mile power grids, the utilities would be allowed to sell bonds to raise funds and use customer money to pay them off. The state would upgrade the high-voltage lines and lease them back to the utilities for operation. In a reflection of the negotiations with the three utilities, a Davis administration official said the deal with PG&E is proving to be more complex than with the other firms. Though PG&E finally agreed late last week to sell its transmission grid, the utility apparently wants more than the $7 billion that Davis has offered, according to sources. The figure is more than twice the book amount, or the value placed on the system for purposes of accounting. And that's the markup that lured Edison into an agreement to sell its smaller portion of the transmission grid for $2.8 billion. But PG&E, which fears an erosion of its economic base, may be asking as much as $10 billion. Due to complexities in the state's 1996 deregulation of the industry, PG&E is more likely to lose revenue than Edison as a result of selling its transmission lines, according to experts. Big customers might be able to bypass the utility's remaining local distribution lines, thereby eroding its customer base. Therefore the utility may view bankruptcy, and sale of its transmission lines to the highest bidder, as a potentially attractive alternative to selling its share of the grid to the state at too low a price. ---- El Paso Energy closes six valley power plants Filed: 03/07/2001 By CHIP POWER, Californian staff writer e-mail: ppower@bakersfield.com El Paso Energy, citing non-payment from Pacific Gas & Electric Co., said it has shut down six cogeneration plants this week. The smaller plants produced about 175 megawatts of electricity and are located primarily in the San Joaquin Valley, said company spokesman Mel Scott. A megawatt can supply power to 1,000 homes. At least 10 plants have closed in the past two weeks as a result of non-payment, according to the state Independent System Operator, which manages most of the state's electrical distribution. The El Paso Energy plants are operated with various partners and had not been compensated for December, January and February deliveries, said Scott. He said he did not know the total amount due but said the plants would be closed until PG&E's credit worthiness is improved. A cogeneration plant, common in oil fields, simultaneously produces heat energy and electrical or mechanical power from the same fuel in the same facility. Typically, it produces electricity and steam, which can be deployed to enhance oil recovery. Kern County is the state's leading oil-producing county. El Paso owns or has interests in more than 40,000 miles of interstate and intrastate pipeline connecting the nation's principal natural gas supply regions to the five largest consuming regions in the United States, namely the Gulf Coast, California, the Northeast, the Midwest and the Southeast. El Paso closed up 99 cents on Tuesday, or 1.4 percent, at $71.49. The Houston-based company's stock price has ranged between $36.31 and $75.30 in the last 52 weeks. ---- Still undecided: Who'll pay DWR for electricity By Karen Gaudette ASSOCIATED PRESS SAN FRANCISCO -- The price tag is $3.2 billion and counting for electricity bought by the state Department of Water Resources for the customers of two nearly bankrupt utilities. Pacific Gas and Electric Co., Southern California Edison and the state disagree over how the DWR eventually will be reimbursed for its purchases on the expensive last-minute power market. So do the state power regulators, who have the final call over who gets the money when. Under a recent law, the DWR went into the electricity-buying business to help keep the two utilities from sinking further into their $13 billion debt. The state plans to retrieve the money by selling $10 billion in revenue bonds. The utilities continue to collect ratepayer dollars on that electricity, which the bill's author, Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, says is meant to help them begin paying down their debt. In a recent letter, however, DWR officials requested that the state Public Utilities Commission order that a portion of that money be diverted to the state. But after the utilities subtract the costs of generating electricity, payments to environmentally friendly power plants and other expenses, there is no money left from ratepayer dollars to give to the DWR without sinking further into debt, PG&E spokesman Ron Low said Tuesday. If it passed along money to the DWR, ""our undercollection would grow by about $2.4 billion by the end of the year,"" Low said. The commission, unable to agree on the best course of action, left the issue untouched at its last meeting but expects to revisit the issue when it meets this morning. Commissioner Richard Bilas is proposing an alternate plan that would have the DWR set its own revenue requirements that would be passed on to ratepayers. The PUC also is expected to respond to complaints from laid-off workers and customers that layoffs by utilities to cut costs have been hurting service. Commissioner Carl Wood warned at the last meeting that failure to provide safe and reliable service could mean fines for the utilities. Representatives from electrical workers unions, the PUC and the utilities were to discuss the issue Tuesday afternoon. ""I don't think we believe that utilities can find a way out of their problems by laying off workers,"" said Mindy Spatt, a spokeswoman with the Utility Reform Network. ""We think consumers deserve safe and reliable service, and we think they deserve it at a reasonable price."" ---- State Taxpayers In Dark on Details Of Energy Deal David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer Wednesday, March 7, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle Few people would purchase a car simply because the dealer said, ''Trust me, it's a great deal.'' Yet Gov. Gray Davis essentially is telling Californians just that about dozens of long-term power contracts. Because of confidentiality agreements with power companies, the governor has revealed only scant details about the state's multibillion-dollar contracts for electricity over the next 10 years. ""Gov. Davis has our money, and we can't see how he's spending it,"" said Doug Heller, a spokesman for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. ""We've been locked out of the room."" Neither Davis nor power companies would divulge specific details about the price, duration or scope of individual contracts. Each cited secrecy clauses that the governor's office said had been desired by both sides. What consumers do know is this: -- California has signed 40 contracts and tentative accords, valued at about $40 billion, to secure enough power to light 9 million homes over the next decade. -- The average purchase price of each deal is $69 per megawatt hour -- well above the $30 to $40 charged by power generators before California's energy market went haywire last summer. -- If, as is widely expected, wholesale power prices fall in years ahead, the state nevertheless will be locked into paying above-market rates for electricity. But it is not known which generator agreed to part with the most power at the cheapest level or the full range of the prices in concocting the $69 average. Moreover, it is unclear how shrewdly the state negotiated with taxpayer money in securing power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities. ""These agreements are the bedrock of our long-term energy policy,"" Davis said Monday in announcing the deals. The governor's office defended the murky nature of the contracts yesterday. ""It's a business transaction in which private corporate information is included,"" said Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Davis. ""That's the kind of information that never gets revealed."" While additional elements of the contracts will be publicized in coming months, he said, the contracts themselves will remain a secret. ""You'll never see all the details,"" Maviglio said. This did not sit well with many observers. ""It's a breach of public trust,"" said Daniel Bacon, a San Francisco attorney specializing in business law. ""A public servant spending public money shouldn't be able to keep the spending secret."" But Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an energy-industry association in Menlo Park, called confidentiality agreements ""a necessary evil in transactions like this."" He explained that no power company would agree to a long-term contract if rival firms could learn the terms of the accord. The company would be losing too much of its competitive edge in the marketplace, Ackerman said. At the same time, he noted that secrecy allowed the buyer -- in this case, California taxpayers -- to secure more favorable terms with individual sellers. A high price with one generator would not necessarily be sought by all power providers. Still, the fact that public funds are being used makes confidentiality in this case a different matter than, say, Cisco Systems' quietly negotiating to take over yet another tech rival. ""The public is in a very awkward position,"" said Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. ""It has to rely on the good word and expertise of the governor, and he has yet to demonstrate that he has expertise or good word in this field."" Shames likened consumers to passengers in a plane being flown by a pilot without a license to fly. ""But what choice do we have?"" he asked. ""I don't see many other options available right now."" There's the rub. No matter how bad a deal California may have cut to help meet its energy demands, the alternative -- blackouts, disruptions, economic catastrophe -- is far, far worse. On the other hand, it already appears that the new contracts will not shield Californians from the threat of daily outages this summer, when demand surges. Davis said only about 60 percent of the state's summertime electricity needs so far had been met. Part of the reason is that many power companies already have contracted for their output this year. Duke Energy said this was why it would not begin its nine-year contract with California until 2002, while Williams Cos. said it would only gradually increase the amount of available wattage in its 10-year contract. Both companies, meanwhile, will continue to profit this summer by selling into the volatile ""spot"" market, where wholesale power went for as much as $1, 500 per megawatt hour last year. ""You can't sell all your power into long-term contracts,"" said Paula Hall- Collins, a Williams spokeswoman. ""You save some for the spot market."" Consumer groups worry that consumers will be hammered again this summer with sky-high power prices, and then get nailed down the road by contracts for above-market rates. ""If we could look at the terms of the deals, we'd see that California is being gouged for 10 years,"" said Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. ""But the governor doesn't want us to see that."" Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum said the state had gotten the best rates it could under current market conditions. ""California went for long-term contracts when everyone else moved in as well,"" he said. ""Californians are paying a price for not acting sooner."" ---- Lawmakers pitch fixes for region's energy woes By David Whitney Bee Washington Bureau (Published March 7, 2001) WASHINGTON -- California members of Congress pleaded for everything from wholesale price caps to extending daylight-saving time an extra hour to help the region cope this summer with its persistent electricity shortage, but none of the ideas seemed to catch fire at a House hearing Tuesday. ""People will die in California because of this crisis,"" Rep. Brad Sherman, a Los Angeles-area Republican, warned the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Sherman testified that his idea for saving lives is to extend daylight-saving time by an extra hour, so that there would be more daylight at the end of the day when power consumption surges. ""One of the peak demand periods for electricity occurs between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m., when the sun sets and people come home from work,"" Sherman testified. ""If people come home and it is light out, there is less of an inclination to turn a light on."" Sherman said the state Legislature has called for congressional approval for states to be given authority to extend daylight-saving time, and he cited analyses by the California Energy Commission and other agencies suggesting that it could cut power consumption by 1 percent to 2 percent. Sherman, who was one of about a dozen California lawmakers presenting their views on the energy squeeze, drew no questions from committee leaders about what his legislation might do to everything from airline schedules to television programming if West Coast states didn't agree on the same time standard. Most of the committee's questioning was on the more popular idea proposed by several California and Western lawmakers, primarily Democrats, to require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose caps on wholesale electricity prices that have gone wild because of a regional power shortage. Rep. Bob Filner, D-San Diego, charged that the price spiral has little to do with power shortages but a lot to do with a ""small cartel"" of generators bilking ratepayers. Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., said he brought up the idea of regional price caps with President Bush, who was initially skeptical. But Inslee said that Bush warmed to the idea after being told that protections could be built into the caps so as not to discourage construction of new power plants. Upon hearing that, Inslee said, Bush invited him to meet with the president's Cabinet-level task force led by Vice President Dick Cheney on a national energy strategy. But Inslee said he can't get the group to meet with him. ""It's very disappointing,"" Inslee said. Tuesday's hearing was part of a series the panel is holding on the California crisis, so far without any emerging consensus on what, if anything, Congress should do. ---- Power plan called wrong Wall Street analysts say the governor's approach to the problem avoids the issue that caused the imbalance. March 7, 2001 By DON THOMPSON The Associated Press SACRAMENTO California's scramble to insulate consumers from the soaring price of electricity may add to the state's power problems this summer, Wall Street analysts said Tuesday. Gov. Gray Davis' emphasis on buying utilities' transmission lines and negotiating long-term power contracts to help ease their debts skirts the deep imbalance between wholesale and market rates that led to the state's power problems in the first place, they said. ""In the long run, it doesn't solve anything,"" said Michael Worms, an industry analyst for Gerard Klauer Mattison & Co. ""In the long run, you need to send the right price signals to consumers, which will create its own conservation signals. Unfortunately, customers were shielded from that in California."" Davis said Monday that the state's first contracts to buy electricity for two financially struggling utilities will provide only about two-thirds of the power needed on a typical summer day, forcing Californians to cut power use at least 10 percent to avoid blackouts. Since early January, the state has been buying one- third of the power Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. customers need. The two utilities, denied credit by suppliers, say they have lost nearly $14 billion due to soaring wholesale electricity prices that the state's industry-deregulation law says they cannot pass on to consumers. The keepers of the state power grid had enough electricity Tuesday to avoid declaring an electricity alert, but have faced an almost-daily scramble for weeks due to a tight supply and high wholesale prices. Several wholesale and retail rate proposals are circulating. Among them: Free-market advocates such as Worms want an immediate end to the deregulation-imposed retail rate freeze on Edison and PG&E that will expire next year. Davis wants a Western price cap of $100 per megawatt hour on power generators he says have been prof iteering from California's short energy supply. The Bush administration and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission are cool to that idea. In December, FERC imposed a ""soft cap"" of $150 per megawatt hour on wholesale rates in the state and required suppliers to justify any higher prices they charge. Consumer groups such as The Utility Reform Network, or TURN, want regulated rates for residential and small-business customers, but free-market rates for large industrial customers, which sought deregulation in the first place. TURN also advocates a tiered rate structure, with higher rates for consumers who use more than a reasonable amount of electricity each month. Assembly Republicans say electricity and natural-gas prices will fall naturally if the state increases supply, mainly by making it easier to build plants and pipelines. ""Right now, you're sort of sitting partially with regulation and part with the free market,"" said Paul Fremont, an analyst with Jefferies & Co. ""Both these systems work. It's sort of that in-between system that you have in Califor nia that doesn't appear to be working."" The system discourages generators from building new power plants because they aren't guaranteed a profit, and it doesn't do enough to discourage power use by consumers because the price they pay doesn't reflect the true cost of power, Fremont said. ""I don't think people here have much faith in the market, and why should they?"" countered TURN's Mindy Spatt. ""I think there are probably better ways of encouraging consumers to conserve than by gouging them."" Davis insists the crisis can be resolved without raising rates for Edison and PG&E customers beyond ""the existing rate structure."" In January, state regulators imposed temporary rate hikes of 7 to 15 percent on Edison and PG&E customers. The Legislature and Davis extended the increases for up to a decade to help pay back the estimated $10 billion in power buying the state expects to do for Edison and PG&E over the next several years, and finance its purchase of the power lines owned by the two companies and San Diego Gas & Electric. Rates were already scheduled to increase next year for Edison and PG&E customers. Under the 1996 deregulation law, the pair's ratepayers saw a 10 percent rate reduction, but only until early 2002. That rate cut will likely expire as planned, Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio has said. Davis wants those rates to cover not only the traditional cost of generating, transporting and distributing power, but the added cost of paying off the two utilities' massive debt and buying their transmission lines, said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, the Assembly's chief power negotiator. Yet Davis has indirectly addressed the rate imbalance by signing legislation that will let regulators raise consumer rates if necessary, Keeley said. The governor and lawmakers are in effect spreading out rate increases over a decade by using long-term revenue bonds to buy power for the nearly bankrupt utilities, said Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy Institute. ""At some point we have to deal with the reality that all of the power that we buy has to be paid for by somebody - it's either going to come from taxpayers or it's going to come from ratepayers,"" Bor enstein said. ""Raising rates now would get us a lot of conservation."" Davis also wants financial incentives for conservation and power-plant construction in time to make a difference this summer. ""Our mouths were agape"" at the rapid timetable, Keeley said. Legislators are rushing to pass those incentives by month's end, he said, allowing three months for consumers and suppliers to act before the heat of summer. Among bills considered Tuesday, the Senate Energy Committee approved legislation to accelerate the siting of power plants. It also was considering a proposal to restructure rates for generators that use renewable energy to provide about 30 percent of the state's electricity. ---- Bill to Cut Some Power Prices Stalls Energy: Democrats balk at varying payment levels for alternative generators. By DAN MORAIN, JULIE TAMAKI, Times Staff Writers SACRAMENTO--Legislation aimed at cutting prices for more than a fourth of the power consumed in California stalled Tuesday, as Democrats questioned why a few alternative energy generators--some of them campaign donors--stood to receive higher payments than others. Lawmakers working to unravel California's energy mess have been negotiating for weeks in an effort to cut the price paid to more than 600 generators of alternative power by more than half, to below 8 cents a kilowatt-hour. Those alternative generators' contracts with utilities have shot up in recent months because of a rise in the price of natural gas. The cash-strapped corporations have suspended or made partial payments to the generators over the last few months, causing many to shut down or reduce their outputs. But even as the lawmakers reached agreement that pushed the average price to near the 8-cent level per kilowatt-hour, some generators would have received higher prices under the bill by state Sen. Jim Battin (R-La Quinta). Some of the generators that stood to benefit had donated to Battin's campaigns. One--Windtec Inc.--gave Battin a $20,000 campaign donation in 1999. Others contributed from $3,000 and $5,000 last year. Battin acknowledged that he has received campaign contributions from some wind power generators but said there is no connection between the donations and the bill's provisions. ""It is illegal, it is unethical and it's not how I do business,"" he said. Battin noted that 25% of the state's alternative energy producers are in his district. As Democrats on the Senate Energy Committee blocked the bill, Battin warned that some alternative energy producers might react to the delay by trying to force Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric into bankruptcy. ""We will be the cause of bankruptcy,"" Battin said. That prompted Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) to retort: ""I'm really tired of being threatened with bankruptcy."" Alternative energy producers, including those that use wind, solar power, biomass and other means, produce 27% of the energy used in California. They sell the electricity to the utilities, which in turn transmit it to retail consumers. But with the utilities facing multibillion-dollar debts, the alternative energy producers under contract with Edison have not been paid since November. Scores of alternative energy producers supported the measure. Edison International and the San Francisco-based consumer group, the Utility Reform Network, opposed it. Michael Florio of the Utility Reform group said the deal could result in higher consumer prices; an Edison representative said the same thing. Battin and Assemblyman Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek) worked out an arrangement with many of the generators. Keeley took the lead in the early negotiations, and then turned to Battin to introduce the legislation, SB 47X. Rather convoluted language would have allowed higher payments to a select few generators that produce electricity from wind and biomass. Most of California's wind suppliers, for instance, would have received about 6 cents per kilowatt-hour. But a handful of them, about half a dozen wind farms--mostly in the Palm Springs area represented by Battin--would have received 7.8 cents. Battin contends that other wind producers receive additional payments that boost them to the same level as Windtec and others that would get the higher payments. ""They get the same deal,"" Battin said of the handful of generators that would benefit from the provisions he added to the bill. In California's overall energy market, the amount of money that would have flowed to the favored generators is minor. But the added prices that would have been paid to the generators would have translated to at least $19 million in the next five years, to be absorbed by Southern California Edison customers, according to one analysis. Also Tuesday, more details were disclosed about another leg of the state's effort to escape from the energy crunch--the deals with large power generators to supply electricity to California for as long as 10 years. Those arrangements were announced by Gov. Gray Davis Monday as ""the bedrock"" of California's energy policy. But some consumer advocates warned that the deals could lock the state into excessively high-priced contracts. S. David Freeman, the general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Davis' negotiator, said that the state guarded against that by varying the time spans of its deals. About 6,000 megawatts are expected to be available this summer, about one-third of the energy needed by the state, Freeman said. The amount of power under contract swells until more than 9,000 megawatts are contracted in 2004, half of the needed amount, before dipping to 8,000 megawatts in 2010. ""What we're doing here is what everybody said had to be done,"" Freeman said. ""We deliberately bought 50% so we'd have a good mix between long-term contracts, which may turn out to be somewhat higher or somewhat lower than the spot market,"" and purchases on the spot market. ---- PG&E could face mutiny on outages: SMUD, others may balk if utility orders summer blackouts By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer (Published March 7, 2001) Sacramento's electric utility wants out of a deal that imposes rolling blackouts locally on PG&E's command. So do a lot of other utilities. They've been writing letters, lobbying lawmakers and launching informal talks with Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to get off the hook before summer. Who dodges the blackout bullet ""is going to play out as a political hot button"" around the state, said George Fraser, head of the Northern California Power Agency, a coalition of municipal utilities. In Sacramento, the next volley is expected soon, with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District reportedly poised to notify PG&E that it will no longer black out homes and businesses on the larger utility's command. ""We are absolutely trying to fight off the requirement for rolling blackouts for the Sacramento area,"" said Linda Davis, one of seven elected members of the SMUD board of directors. Saying they don't want to be dragged down by somebody else's problems, two Southern California utilities have written grid operators asking to be exempted from any blackouts caused by PG&E's or Southern California Edison's financial woes. But in PG&E's view, ""California is in an energy crisis (and) ... we're all in this together,"" said spokesman John Nelson. The maneuvering comes amid bleak forecasts for power supplies this summer. Although Gov. Gray Davis has said conservation, new power plants and moderate weather could avert blackouts, officials at the Independent System Operator, which runs much of California's grid, expect frequent rotating outages. One consulting firm, Cambridge Energy Research Associates, predicts 20 hours of rolling blackouts during July and August, and about 200 hours of especially intense calls for voluntary cutbacks. Before blackouts hit, the jockeying over just whose lights, air conditioners and assembly lines will be shut down is growing. The outcome could affect millions of people statewide. The state Public Utilities Commission is probing rolling blackout programs run by the for-profit utilities it regulates, including PG&E and Edison. A PUC analysis has suggested that PG&E's program, which currently exempts about 40 percent of its customers, should spread the burden more broadly. For example, it said, 1.9 million homes and businesses are spared just because they share a circuit with a customer deemed ""essential."" But not-for-profit utilities such as SMUD, which answer to their own elected boards or city councils, have other worries. Many have already lined up their power supplies for summer. Some have raised rates or are considering raising rates. Some have taken extra conservation steps. They think those preparations ought to give them leverage to ease blackout clauses in their contracts with PG&E. SMUD general manager Jan Schori ""is going to use every avenue ... any avenue, to put pressure on,"" including lobbying the ISO, the governor and others, said utility director Davis. The Northern California Power Agency, a joint-powers authority that owns and operates power plants for municipal utilities, has begun informal negotiations with PG&E to change blackout rules, according to Fraser, its top executive. It is preparing to write PG&E, asking that its members be exempted from outages altogether. Failing that, it wants them to face fewer outages or to be compensated for cutting off power, he said. At SMUD, the utility board has met in closed session to discuss exactly what it is required to do during electric emergencies, under terms of the interconnection contract that links SMUD's lines to PG&E's. ""The contracts are being inspected with a fine-tooth comb,"" said SMUD director Howard Posner. Schori declined to comment on any specifics. Sources indicated that the main option being considered is notifying PG&E that because of changed circumstances, SMUD believes it no longer is required to routinely comply with outage requests. Other options being explored include re-negotiating existing agreements with PG&E. Posner said that ever since two days of rolling blackouts in January, constituents have been asking him, "" 'Why are we participating when we're not the problem?' And I don't have a good answer to that."" Several directors said SMUD has already spent a lot of money -- and is considering 16 percent rate increases -- to ensure that it has enough electricity under contract to meet its customers' summer demands. They believe PG&E should do the same. ""We're almost like a David against Goliath here,"" said board vice president Genevieve Shiroma. ""The huge investor-owned utilities next door have severe problems that they need to get under control."" In addition, SMUD plans to argue that because it can cut usage through its ""Peak Corps"" program, which remotely turns off air conditioners at volunteer households, it has already done its part without rotating outages, director Davis said. PG&E believes the interconnection agreements that govern smaller utilities' ties to its transmission lines have ""benefits and burdens to both sides,"" said Nelson. ""It wouldn't be fair or good policy for just one provision to be altered without taking a look at how that affects the entire contract,"" he said. Interconnection contracts generally have clauses that require utilities to help each other out to avert greater emergencies. Sometimes reducing demand -- called load shedding -- can be the only way to stabilize the electric grid in the seconds after a major power plant or transmission line fails. ""It's been around in the electrical fabric forever,"" said Jim Pope, head of Silicon Valley Power, Santa Clara's city-run utility. In addition to legal requirements, ""you have a moral obligation so you don't bring the system to collapse."" Like other city-run utilities, Silicon Valley Power has a contract with PG&E that requires it to shed load during an electric emergency. But its contract allows it to work with big users to reduce their demand, so no one has to be completely shut off. Such agreements, formed long before deregulation when PG&E ran the north state's grid, now are complicated by the 1997 creation of the state Independent System Operator. The ISO today runs pieces of the grid owned by PG&E, Edison, and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. If it believes power use is about to surge past supply, potentially triggering a grid collapse across the western United States, the ISO notifies the three utilities that they have to shed a certain number of megawatts. The big utilities meet that requirement two ways. They cut circuits to some of their own customers, and they tell smaller, connected utilities to cut a proportionate share. In Northern California, about 80 percent of the outages are borne by PG&E customers and the rest by customers of SMUD and other municipal utilities and irrigation districts. ""In one sense, we are all in this together. If SMUD were in danger of going down, we would hope others would help us out,"" said SMUD's Posner. ""But that's if we're in danger from circumstances beyond our control, not from mismanagement or lack of financial wherewithal."" It is unclear what penalties, if any, a utility would face for violating an interconnection agreement. In the long run, the issue would be fought either in the courts or before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, grid officials said. As a practical matter, in the seconds when the risk to the grid is greatest, if one utility refused to shed load, the ISO would probably solve to problem by calling on PG&E, Edison or others who are willing to make deeper cutbacks, they said. ---- PUC to Decide Fate Of Utility Workers PG&E, Edison want to trim costs by laying off thousands, cutting service Bernadette Tansey, Chronicle Staff Writer Wednesday, March 7, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle State regulators are set to decide today whether debt-ridden Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison can conserve cash by laying off thousands of workers and letting service standards slip. Union officials who protested the layoffs before the California Public Utilities Commission warn that if the cuts go through, neighborhoods hit by power outages could stay dark for hours, and more customers could face busy signals when they call about their bills. An administrative law judge agreed, advising the commission in February to order the utilities to restore 725 positions already cut and block the elimination of an additional 2,125 jobs. Judge John Wong said PG&E and Edison have acknowledged the layoffs will not substantially improve their shaky financial condition, which arose from skyrocketing wholesale electricity costs the utilities could not pass on to consumers under a rate cap. ""The savings would barely make a dent,"" Wong said in his draft decision. The two companies together claim that their debt from power purchases amounts to more than $13 billion. PG&E says it has saved $18 million from the first wave of 325 layoffs. Wong's recommendation is already running into resistance on the PUC. Commissioner Richard Bilas said the five-member panel should not be micromanaging the utilities in a time of crisis. Bilas has proposed an alternate ruling that would allow the utilities to make the cuts, but provide for PUC monitoring of service in case the commission wants to step in later. ""We're in a situation where the utilities are not collecting the revenues they need to operate, and yet we may be guilty of not letting them cut expenses where they can cut expenses,"" Bilas said. PG&E spokesman Jon Tremayne said savings from the layoffs are helping to keep electricity running and gas flowing. ""It keeps cash in our accounts so we can keep doing day-to-day business,"" Tremayne said. In addition to the 325 positions dropped so far, PG&E is proposing to cut an additional 675 during the next three to six months. The cuts affect temporary and contract workers who read meters, handle new service hookups and replace equipment. PG&E has no plans to eliminate permanent positions. The company is struggling to keep up with a higher workload at its call center as customers deluge the lines with inquiries about their rising bills and the effects of deregulation. Calls to PG&E ballooned from 1.3 million in January 2000 to 2.3 million in January 2001. Bilas advocates granting PG&E's request to temporarily relax standards requiring the utility to respond swiftly to customer calls and to read customers' meters once a month. PG&E wants to read meters bimonthly and send bills based on the estimated use between readings. Discrepancies could be corrected later. Wong called those measures unacceptable. He said customers need to know immediately if their efforts to conserve power are working. Wong also said the utilities' own experts have said the workforce reductions will lengthen the time required to restore power after nonemergency equipment failure. Eric Wolfe, communications director for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 1245, said some customers have already been left without power overnight because PG&E is trying to avoid the use of overtime on nonemergency power outages. ""It hurts a lineman to walk away from the job leaving a customer without power,"" Wolfe said. Tremayne said PG&E is trying to minimize overtime costs, but denied the company has allowed customers to go without power out of financial concerns. He said crews were pulled out when darkness and falling trees made the work too dangerous. ---- Power prices could soar during the summer Posted at 10:35 p.m. PST Tuesday, March 6, 2001 BY STEVE JOHNSON Mercury News Unless Gov. Gray Davis arranges significantly more long-term electricity contracts or persuades people to turn off a lot more lights, California's unpredictable spot market for power could wreak havoc this summer. Even with the 40 long-term deals announced by Davis on Monday, experts interviewed Tuesday said, up to 43 percent of the state's daily needs may have to come from this highly volatile market, in which power is bought within a day of need. That could could prove hugely expensive, because some spot market energy has cost five to six times what it would under the long-term contracts. It's widely expected that consumers ultimately would have to pay that tab, which could amount to billions of dollars. And because that power won't be locked up in contracts, there is no guarantee it will be available when it's needed, which could lead to blackouts, according to a recent report to the California Independent System Operator, which oversees three-fourths of the state's power grid. ``The situation in California could reach catastrophic proportions,'' the report concluded, adding that unless things change dramatically, ``it is a virtual certainty that peak demand will go unmet during many hot summer days.'' Steven Maviglio, Davis' press secretary, conceded Tuesday that the spot market could be troublesome. ``It's a major concern,'' he said, which is why the state is trying to line up more power contracts, speed up power plant construction and promote conservation. During the normally hot month of August, peak daily demand for power in the Independent System Operator's territory is expected to hit about 47,700 megawatts -- enough for nearly 48 million homes. The state's three main utility firms generate about 8,200 megawatts and have long-term contracts from wind, solar and other energy sources for about 11,700 megawatts more. That totals about 20,000 megawatts. Add in the 7,000 megawatts of long-term power that Davis has announced for this summer, and the state is still nearly 21,000 megawatts short. Costly proposition If all that power has to be obtained on the spot market, the price could be high. On Friday, last-minute purchases on the market averaged $411 per megawatt-hour, compared to about $150 per megawatt-hour for all power obtained by the Independent System Operator and $69 per megawatt-hour on average under Davis' long-term contracts. It's possible that not all 21,000 megawatts would have to be purchased on the market. Assuming Davis is successful in getting people to save 10 percent -- which could prove difficult -- conservation could reduce peak demand by nearly 5,000 megawatts. California also might be able to trade for another 5,000 megawatts with the federal government's Bonneville Power Administration and a hydroelectric operator in British Columbia, said Arthur O'Donnell, editor of California Energy Markets, a trade publication. Under such deals, those two outfits often send that much power to California when they don't need it and California returns the same amount or more when its demand is low. But O'Donnell said it wasn't clear whether 5,000 megawatts would be available this summer, because ``they still haven't gotten the snowpack they need in the Pacific Northwest,'' which could limit that region's generating capacity. Still falling short Even if those hydropower imports are available and conservation works as Davis hopes, it's likely California would still require the spot market for 11,000 megawatts to meet the August demand. That's more than 20 percent of the state's overall power needs. ``All of the surrounding states are buying probably less than 5 percent, at most, of their energy on the spot market,'' said Frank Wolak, a Stanford economist, who monitors electricity prices for the Independent System Operator. He worries about how much that power could cost and is disturbed that state officials haven't adequately addressed the issue. ``No one has any idea what they are going to do, and that is part of the problem,'' he said. Officials at Pacific Gas & Electric Co. are particularly concerned. They fear that their company -- which is nearing bankruptcy -- could get stuck for much of the spot market purchases by the Independent System Operator, which has threatened to bill the utilities for the cost. Fearing the annual bill for that power could hit $2.4 billion this year, PG&E wants the tab sent to the Department of Water Resources, which also is buying power on the spot market for the state. But the Department of Water Resources has objected to that idea and the matter is expected to be heard today by the California Public Utilities Commission. ``We're looking for clarity on a number of issues'' regarding how the spot market will work ``and certainly that's one of them,'' said Thomas Hannigan, the water agency's director. ``I don't think anybody knows the answer of who's going to pay for it,'' added PG&E spokesman John Nelson. But Nettie Hoge, executive director of the Utility Reform Network in San Francisco, said she suspects consumers ultimately will foot the bill. The unfortunate likelihood about spot market purchases is that ``ratepayers are responsible for all of it eventually,'' Hoge said. ``It's a very big problem.'' ---- Power Plant Plans Cause Conflicts East county residents blast supervisors Jason B. Johnson, Chronicle Staff Writer Wednesday, March 7, 2001 Industry dreams of building new power plants in east Contra Costa's hills are prompting an angry reaction among residents and elected officials who say they don't want more plants. The conflict was sparked by a vote by county supervisors yesterday to aggressively explore possible sites for new power plants throughout the county. The measure by Supervisors Mark DeSaulnier and Federal Glover, which passed on a 4-to-0 vote, directs the county administrator and Department of Community Development to compile a report on possible sites within 45 days. Supervisor Donna Gerber abstained after criticizing the plan for potentially repeating the same mistakes that plagued the state's energy deregulation effort by not considering how much energy the state, region and county will need in future years, and how much power is slated to come online. Gerber said alternative power sources, such as solar, should also be examined. A site drawing much attention is on top of a deposit of natural gas near the Concord Naval Weapons Station off Highway 4. The owners of 70 acres of land near the station recently formed a company, Golden State Power Co., to pursue construction of at least one small peaker plant and a much larger facility capable of producing 600 megawatts. The site could hold up to three small 50-megawatt peaker plants, and a larger 15-acre natural gas plant, said Steve Thomas, managing partner with Golden State. No land use applications have been filed. Thomas said 30 acres could be kept as open space to form a buffer around the project. ""Both (facilities) are state of the art,"" said Thomas. ""We believe that the site is ideal."" But east county residents at yesterday's meeting blasted the supervisorial measure and the power plant proposal, complaining that more plants could put people's health at risk. The region already is home to six power plants. ""We're going to get a good dose of poor air quality and (negative) health conditions from this,"" said Concord resident Evelyn Frietas. ""I think we need to stop and think about what we're doing to our quality of life."" Dan Torres said the home he bought in 1995 at a new Bay Point development would be alarmingly close to the proposed Golden State site. ""It will be dragging emissions over our home,"" said Torres. ""I didn't buy a home on that hill to be surrounded by power plants."" There are six power plants in operation in east Contra Costa. Pittsburg already has two power plants, and two more under construction. City Council members Frank Aiello and Yvonne Beals said the Antioch-Pittsburg area has done more than its share of energy production. Aiello said Pittsburg will soon produce enough energy to power three million homes in California. ""When is enough, enough?"" asked Aiello. ""Pittsburg has shouldered responsibility for a land-fill and two more power plants. At some point you have to say enough."" Beals said that while power plants have added millions to the city's general fund, the negatives of additional plants could outweigh the benefits. ""I don't think that Pittsburg or east county should be the dumping ground for energy for California,"" said Beals. ---- Supervisors set search for power plant sites The board also heard from the potential developers of a 650-megawatt plant between Bay Point and Concord By Thomas Peele TIMES STAFF WRITER MARTINEZ -- Contra Costa County supervisors took tentative steps Tuesday toward allowing the construction of at least one small power plant before summer, ordering that its staff identify potential sites in unincorporated areas within seven weeks. The board voted 4-0 to search for locations. Third District Supervisor Donna Gerber abstained, saying her colleagues lacked a ""comprehensive context'' to identify sites. ""I think the board knows just enough to be dangerous,'' she said. Gerber said the county should examine the potential for additional power plants within its borders but not investigate individual sites yet. But Fourth District Supervisor Mark DeSaulnier said the action was necessary because of the energy crisis and because of Gov. Gray Davis' call for local governments to help speed the construction of so-called ""peaker plants"" before July and August. ""I wouldn't do this except under an emergency,"" DeSaulnier said after the vote. ""There are unusual circumstances. We're not talking about putting this in a residential area."" Fifth District Supervisor Federal Glover backed DeSaulnier, but said he hoped for a location outside his heavily industrialized East County district. ""There's a lot of concern in East County as to the number of plants,"" he said. DeSaulnier said, though, that the only logical place for a small plant remains the ""industrial belt'' stretching along the waterfront from West County to Antioch. He declined to provide specifics, but said the only other potential site outside the industrial areas was the Concord Naval Weapons Station property. But he quickly added that he believes the U.S. Department of Defense ""would never go for it."" Also, DeSaulnier said he could not rule out the county building the plant itself and entering the electricity-selling market during peak demand times. Board Chairwoman Gayle Uilkema called that idea extremely premature and unlikely. ""That's a very powerful decision. I do not think we are ready,'' she said. The California Energy Commission listed the Equilon refinery in Martinez as one of 32 potential ""peaker plant"" sites in the state last week. Peaker plants kick in during peak usage times. Davis called for their quick construction before the height of summer and its energy demand for air conditioning. Plants that generate as much as 50,000 megawatts don't need Energy Commission approval. DeSaulnier said he believed a peaker plant could be built about a month after final approval. Supervisors also heard from the potential developers of a 650-megawatt plant between Bay Point and Concord. Walnut Creek commercial real estate developer Steve Thomas announced his intentions for the site north of Highway 4 last week. Construction could take two years. Eric Hasseltine, a consultant representing Thomas and what he described as a ""brand new"" company for the site, the Golden State Power Co., told supervisors that if they intended to speed peaker plant construction they should do what they can to expedite the larger plant. The Thomas site could house a peaker plant until the proposed larger one goes online. A large natural gas line passes under the site. DeSaulnier seemed cautious about the larger proposal, which he had described last week as ""a good site."" Uilkema, too, said she knew too little about it to comment. A resident who lives near the Thomas property asked the board to ""build it (the larger plant) closer to where you have industrial areas. You have to carefully consider the people"" who live nearby, said Dan Torres, 39. Evelyn Freitas of Concord said she lives downwind of the proposed site. ""Our air quality is going to be worse then it is now,"" she said. Gerber played on the environmental issues, saying the county already ranks second statewide to Los Angeles in volume of hazardous materials and amount of electrical generation. ---- Peter Schrag: California's $90 billion infrastructure gap (Published March 7, 2001) By now, California's surreal energy mess has grown from a crisis to a condition. It may not be quite as permanent as, say, death and taxes, but it's still something that could get a whole lot worse before it gets better. Until there's more realistic pricing, no gubernatorial pea-under-the-shell buyout scheme will solve it. Beyond the energy crisis, however, and in many ways similar to it, California faces a whole range of other infrastructure problems -- in transportation, in water resources and sewer systems, in school and university buildings -- that seem, once again, to be all but forgotten. The Business Roundtable has estimated the need at roughly $90 billion, though no number can possibly be exact. What's certain is that after a burst of high-level investment in public facilities during the 1950s and 1960s, California's annual capital investment has sunk precipitously -- from an annual $150 per capita in the 1960s, according to a set of recent studies for PPIC, the Public Policy Institute of California, to about $30 in the 1990s. But you probably don't need to tell anyone driving Bay Area or Los Angeles freeways or looking at the ubiquitous portable classrooms, those dreary brown boxes that house a fourth of our public school students. Ever since passage of Proposition 13 in 1978, we have been flying the flag of deferred maintenance. As in the state's electricity crisis, however, there's no way California can effectively address those problems merely by building or bonding itself out of them. In highway construction, in developing water resources, in finding enough university space to accommodate the Tidal Wave II of students, managing demand is likely to be as crucial to any solution as new construction. In the energy market -- and in electricity particularly -- it's been a familiar principle ever since David Roe of the Environmental Defense Fund first persuaded Pacific Gas and Electric that a dollar invested in conservation may be worth as much as the same investment in new generation. But in most other sectors of California's infrastructure, state and local, it's a lesson still to be learned. There have been scattered attempts to encourage conservation and reduce demand -- significant reduction in water use, for example, through the installation of low-flow faucets and low-flush toilets; some reduction in traffic by using rush-hour diamond lanes or by adjusting highway or (as in New York) bridge tolls to levels of congestion. But as pointed out by David Dowall, an urban economist at Berkeley, state policy-makers have not really begun to ""consider how demand management strategies can be applied to infrastructure service areas,"" or how the more efficient use of facilities and more realistic pricing -- highway tolls, say, or parking fees -- ""can reduce demand for scarce infrastructure resources."" In any case, says Dowall in one of the PPIC reports, we should pick which major projects we will build not just according to per capita estimates of how much we need, but according to how much consumers are willing to pay for them. To avoid hurting the poor, congestion-related highway tolls and other tariffs can be rebated on the basis of income. University fees can be means-tested. In California, they also could be adjusted to encourage summer school classes and other off-peak uses, rather than (as in the past) making UC summer courses more expensive. Given the political and economic uncertainties, there's no way to know how far such demand management can be taken. But there's not much doubt that, as Dowall and others point out, the state's infrastructure planning is a jumble of uncoordinated agency agendas and wish lists. The Legislature last year passed a bill, AB 1473, by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, that requires the governor, beginning next year, to submit an annual five-year infrastructure plan for state agencies and public schools, along with recommendations on how to fund it. In addition, Gov. Gray Davis' infrastructure commission is expected to recommend better coordination of infrastructure and land-use planning when it issues its report this spring. That would be a start. As California State Treasurer Phil Angelides has pointed out, the state desperately needs to start joint planning -- regional planning -- for housing, roads and other resources to reduce the need for long commutes; to preserve open space; and to bring jobs to where people live and housing to where the jobs are. That would itself reduce demand for more freeway lanes and, equally important, improve the quality of life. At present, most planning for housing, roads, water systems and other facilities rarely recognizes the regional impact of local decisions. In the East Bay, slow-growth forces push well-intended initiatives that would force more development into Tracy or Modesto and further tax the transportation systems to Silicon Valley. In city after city, there are beggar-thy-neighbor efforts to grab yet another shopping mall that produces a little extra sales tax revenue for the city that gets it, and that often compounds traffic and revenue problems in adjacent communities. In higher education we divide bond proceeds evenly among UC, the California State University and the community colleges even though the community colleges serve eight times as many students as UC. We plan road projects according to county, not regional, priorities. It is all done according to antiquated political and fiscal formulas that often no longer make sense. We don't just need better capital planning; we need a whole new planning system. ---- PG&E power plan debated at hearing A PUC meeting on the utility's capacity expansion project for the Tri-Valley follows weeks of protest from officials, residents Power upgrade in valley debated By Megan Long TIMES STAFF WRITER SAN FRANCISCO -- Dublin officials and the developer of a Livermore subdivision faced questions Tuesday about their opposition to alternative routes of PG&E's controversial Tri-Valley power upgrade plan -- and answered by restating their long-standing objections. Tuesday's cross-examination came during the third and likely final week of the California Public Utility Commission's evidentiary hearings on the utility's $91 million Tri-Valley 2002 Capacity Increase Project. It has followed weeks of protests of PG&E's upgrade plans by officials and residents of Livermore, Pleasanton, Dublin and San Ramon. And before the questioning started, Dublin Vice Mayor Janet Lockhart reiterated concerns about an alternative route deemed ""environmentally superior"" that would place a substation just 1,000 feet north of Interstate 580 between Tassajara and Fallon roads. She said that would undermine the results of a 15-year process to plan the eastern development of the city. ""It's extremely important to the residents of our community to follow a plan we worked hard to produce,"" she said. Dublin officials favor PG&E's proposed placement of the station three miles north of the freeway, away from new high-tech company offices and housing developments. Besides the Dublin substation, the project calls for construction of a substation in North Livermore, expansion of the Pleasanton substation and installation of 23.5 miles of new lines. In response to questions from PUC Administrative Law Judge Michelle Cooke, Dublin's public works director, Lee Thompson, confirmed that the Lin family, the owner of the property where the alternative substation would go, wasn't interested in selling the land to PG&E. Cooke also asked Thompson to define a ""discretionary permit,"" which is how city officials said they might treat a permit for a substation. Lee said that type of permit is one the city has the right to approve or not depending on the project's impact. Eddie Peabody, Dublin's community development director, testified that the zoning for the Lin property accommodates uses such as commercial business, research and development and light manufacturing. It would not, he said, be appropriate for a power substation. He said parcels within the East Dublin area that could host a station would include those zoned for public and semi-public uses, including land recently bought by Oracle and Sun Microsystems for new campuses. While Dublin officials testified that one buyer of land in that area paid $86 per square foot, others suggested land prices would be inflated to help make a PG&E land buy look prohibitively expensive. An executive of Centex Homes, the developer of new houses near Isabel Avenue and Concannon Boulevard, objected to an alternative route that would place high-voltage transmission lines overhead along Isabel and Stanley Boulevard. David Barclay, president of Centex's Northern California division, said that the 80-foot to 150-foot towers would have a severe visual impact on residents of the Prima tract. Ed O'Neill, a lawyer for the Kottinger Ranch Homeowners Association, pointed out that existing distribution lines on 50-foot poles on Isabel already mar the view for residents. The Foley family has been ranching on land south of Pleasanton city limits for years, said their attorney Kennedy Richardson. The utility's project would place overhead lines and a transmission station on rolling hills that the family envisions as one day being public open space with limited development, Richardson said. Lawyers for Pleasanton, Livermore, Kottinger Ranch and Centex are scheduled to cross-examine a PG&E engineer today about the project's routing. That testimony should be the most controversial of the hearings. Judge Cooke is expected to recommend an alignment by July to the PUC, which will make the final decision. ---- NEWS State OKs 'Peaker' Power Plant at SFO / Temporary generator could be sending electricity to 50,000 homes by August Marshall Wilson 03/08/2001 The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL Page A.20 (Copyright 2001) State energy officials yesterday approved plans to build a temporary electrical plant at San Francisco International Airport that should generate enough juice to power 50,000 homes by August. Meeting in Sacramento, the Energy Commission voted 4-0 to give the green light to the gas-fired plant. It will operate during peak summer and winter demand to help the state avoid Stage 3 power alerts and rolling blackouts. Texas-based El Paso Merchant Energy Co. won approval under a new state law mandating speedy, four-month reviews of so-called ""peaker"" plants. It was the only one of seven applications statewide to win approval. The other proposals were withdrawn for various reasons. The 51-megawatt plant, formally called the United Golden Gate Power Project, is scheduled to be built at the northwest corner of the airport near the United Airlines maintenance center. Within the next few weeks El Paso plans to apply to build a 571- megawatt, $400 million plant in the same area, company spokesman Jesse Frederick said. It would undergo a separate review by state energy officials. The small ""peaker"" plant approved yesterday is to generate electricity beginning around Aug. 1 for up to three years. After the end of three years, the plant would be closed or converted to a cleaner-burning system. Under state law, a temporary ""peaker"" plant is permitted to spew more air pollution than a permanent plant. El Paso's temporary plant is to be built next to a co-generation plant operated by United Airlines. It would use existing connections for natural gas and water supplies and tap into existing power transmission lines. Electricity generated by the plant would be pumped into the state's electrical grid, Energy Commission spokesman Gary Fay said. It would also serve as a backup for San Francisco Airport in case of a blackout. No one spoke against the proposed plant at yesterday's commission meeting. The proposal, however, has been criticized by area residents and environmentalists worried about air pollution. Scott Buschman, a professional photographer and San Bruno resident, said yesterday it was unjust that state officials 100 miles away in Sacramento approved a Texas company's proposal to put a power plant on land owned by San Francisco. ""The fact that they approved it without considering the public's concerns, foremost air quality, is very disturbing,"" he said. Fay said the plant complies with clean-air standards. Answering the criticism about the location of yesterday's deliberation, he said three hearings and several workshops were held in communities near the airport.

Davis's Plan To Power California --- State's Outlays for Electricity May Be Hard to Recover Without Rate Increases --- Betting on Long-Term Deals By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Rebecca Smith, Mitchel Benson and John R. Emshwiller 03/08/2001 The Wall Street Journal A1 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Earlier this year, Gov. Gray Davis made what may be the biggest bet in the history of the nation's biggest state: that he could tame an out-of-control electricity market and avoid devastating blackouts without busting the state's budget, antagonizing its consumers or derailing his own political career. His wager is still on the table, but the assumptions that underlie it are looking increasingly shaky these days. The governor has already spent around $2 billion of public money buying hugely expensive wholesale power, taking over the role formerly played by the state's near-bankrupt electric utilities. And California will probably be obliged to spend billions more before its electricity market stabilizes and those utilities are restored to some semblance of financial health. Under the governor's plan, California aims to recoup the money it is using to buy electricity by issuing $10 billion in bonds. That way it would still have a healthy budget surplus to finance new spending on roads, schools and other public services. But there's a potentially big obstacle to this plan. The state Legislature, worried about racking up billions in new debt, has put limits on the size of any bond offering. In broad terms, the Legislature's action would allow the state to borrow only four times as much as it can recover annually from utility customers. Right now that doesn't appear to be much. Under the current rate structure, essentially set in place by California's flawed 1996 electricity-deregulation plan, consumers pay far less for power than the cost of acquiring it on the wholesale market. Preliminary estimates submitted by utilities last month to the California Public Utilities Commission show the state's share of the proceeds from electricity sales this year could be as little as $241 million -- not enough to support even $1 billion in bond sales under the Legislature's formula. That would leave the state on the hook for much of the money it has already paid for power -- not to mention the billions more Gov. Davis will need to spend. That, in turn, raises the prospect that California's economy and its credit rating both could deteriorate significantly. But state finance officials say that, based on their own projections, they will be able to extract enough money to support a $10 billion bond issue. Walking a careful line between fiscal prudence and political survival, Mr. Davis and others in his administration are scrambling to come up with ways to get around the legislative restrictions without raising rates for consumers. ""If I wanted to raise rates, I could solve this problem in 20 minutes,"" Mr. Davis says. The governor says he believes that the state can obtain enough affordable power through long-term power-supply contracts to avoid the need for a big rate increase. The billions of dollars the state hopes to borrow would be used to help pay for power until electricity prices drop, as they are expected to do when new power plants come online over the next few years. The Davis administration fears that what may be its only other option -- a big increase in retail electric rates -- could prompt angry consumer groups to seek new electricity laws through a statewide ballot initiative during next year's election. That's when Mr. Davis is expected to run for a second term as governor. But trying to save California without rate increases is forcing Mr. Davis to make some colossal gambles with the state's money. State officials estimate that in the next several months, California will need to spend as much as $6 billion on power purchases -- equivalent to the state's entire fiscal surplus. Mr. Davis is also looking to spend several billion more to buy the transmission assets of three investor-owned utilities in order to restore two of them to credit-worthiness. He also has announced plans to spend several hundred million dollars more on conservation programs designed to reduce demand while new power plants are being built in the state. In order to limit the state's financial exposure in the meantime, the governor and his aides have, in some cases, ignored state law. They have threatened appointed officials who have stood in the way. And they have sharply restricted the flow of information to the public. None of those steps is expected to do much to reduce state spending on power in the coming months. In a few weeks, power usage is expected to begin a sharp seasonal rise as Californians switch on their air conditioners with the coming of warmer weather. By various estimates, demand during peak periods this summer could outstrip supply by 10%, or several thousand megawatts. That could produce more rolling blackouts like the ones that hit Northern California earlier this year. It is also likely to put strong upward pressure on wholesale electricity prices. Steven Zimmerman, managing director of Standard & Poor's Corp., says Mr. Davis and his aides don't ""have a lot of time"" to put a cap on the state's financial exposure to the crisis. The credit-rating agency has put the state on credit watch for a possible downgrade, which would affect the value of all of California's outstanding public debt. Moody's Investor Service Inc. is also concerned. It said in a recent report that the power crisis could soon ""seriously threaten the health"" of the state's economy. Mr. Davis, a Democrat and career politician, was dealt a bad hand when he took office in 1999. The deregulation plan that sparked the state's electricity crisis was enacted under his predecessor, Republican Pete Wilson. But Mr. Davis was slow to react to early signs of trouble this past summer and alarms sounded by members of the state Legislature. By the time Mr. Davis finally sprang into action earlier this year, a troublesome power-supply squeeze had escalated into a crisis. In a Jan. 17 declaration of emergency, the governor designated the state Department of Water Resources to take the utilities' place as the daily buyer of huge quantities of electricity. His hope: that by making the state the dominant player in California's power sector, he would ease electricity producers' concerns about getting paid and give the state enough clout to negotiate lower long-term power prices. Earlier this week, Mr. Davis announced final or tentative agreements with 20 power suppliers to furnish the state with a total of 8,900 megawatts for periods of as long as 20 years. But the supply situation remains extremely uncertain for this summer, when demand probably will top 45,000 megawatts. If the state can secure enough power under contract and push down demand through aggressive conservation, it might be able to squeak through the summer season. If not, it will be forced to keep buying huge amounts of costly power in the cash market. Under deregulation, retail electric rates were frozen for several years, while wholesale-power costs were free to fluctuate. When the plan was conceived, wholesale prices were low and expected to go lower. However, a combination of unexpected growth in power demand and a lack of new generating capacity helped produce a supply squeeze. Average wholesale prices more than tripled last year from 1999. And in January those prices were up 10-fold from a year earlier. By then, California's two biggest investor-owned utilities -- the Pacific Gas & Electric unit of PG&E Corp. and the Southern California Edison subsidiary of Edison International -- faced imminent financial collapse. They had racked up billions of dollars in wholesale power bills they couldn't afford to pay. As generators began shying away from selling to the two utilities, the Clinton administration forced them to sell power into the California market, an order left in place during the first weeks of the Bush administration. Still, northern California was hit by rolling blackouts on several days in early January. Since then, the DWR, which does some electricity trading as an adjunct to its main mission of managing the state's giant system of aqueducts and reservoirs, has had to learn the ins and outs of power markets on the run. It hasn't been easy. David Mills, trading-floor manager for the federal Bonneville Power Administration, says the water agency has at times offered to pay $50 to $100 per megawatt hour more than the available market price. ""They agree to prices that make you wonder,"" says Mr. Mills, whose organization markets electricity from federal dams in the Pacific Northwest. ""You'd at least think they'd check to see what the prevailing price is before throwing out their offer."" Mr. Mills says that ""to cut California some slack,"" he occasionally has instructed his traders to sell at prices lower than the DWR had offered to pay. Ray Hart, the water agency deputy director responsible for the power purchasing, says he isn't aware of any cases in which the DWR has overpaid. He says his team has been ""extremely successful by all measures."" Ultimately, the DWR's trading acumen is far less important than the overall arithmetic of power supply and demand in California. With the price of natural gas that feeds many of the region's generating plants at near record levels and some suppliers reluctant to sell into the troubled California market, wholesale electric prices remain stubbornly high and, in recent days, have again been rising. The Legislature has advanced the DWR about $3 billion from the state's general fund for power purchases. Under emergency legislation passed by the Legislature and signed by Mr. Davis on Feb. 1, the general fund is to be reimbursed from a planned bond sale later this year. But under terms of the emergency law, the water agency would have to wrest $2.5 billion a year in revenue from retail electricity rates in order to sell the $10 billion worth of bonds sought by Mr. Davis. Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, a Southern California Democrat, says the formula was created to ensure that there would be a way to repay the bonds without draining the state's coffers. ""We didn't want to just open our wallets,"" he says. According to the language of the Feb. 1 law, the water agency gets what's left of revenue collected from ratepayers after the utilities pay certain of their own power-supply bills and other expenses. And, in their filings with the PUC last month, the utilities reckoned, under their worst-case scenarios, that there would be only $241 million available to the DWR this year. State officials are quietly pushing the PUC to rejigger the formula so that the water department gets more money -- even though that would clash with terms of the Feb. 1 law. Robert Miyashiro, deputy director of the Department of Finance, says the emergency law was ""drafted poorly"" and has led people to believe the DWR ""only gets the leftover money."" He predicts there will be ""cleanup legislation."" At the request of the Davis administration, the PUC is considering a plan to use a different revenue-sharing formula than the one in the state law. The proposed new formula was written ""in close consultation"" with Mr. Davis's Finance Department, says PUC President Loretta Lynch, who supports the initiative and is hoping to rush it through. The effort has drawn some opposition. Commissioner Richard Bilas at a recent PUC meeting questioned the legality of the commission attempting to change a formula set by the Legislature. PG&E is even more emphatic, since the DWR's extra money could come at the utility's expense. The formula ""threatens to undo the very financial protections for the utilities that [the new law] attempted to provide,"" the utility said in a recent filing with the PUC. As politicians and regulators wrestle with that issue, the Davis administration has taken a step to reduce the outflow of state cash that also seems to conflict with the Feb. 1 law. It was widely assumed that the law required the DWR to buy any electricity the state needed to keep its lights on. However, on many occasions, the DWR has refused to buy power on the grounds that it was too expensive, citing a portion of the new law that urges the agency to hold down costs. The task of covering any remaining shortfall has passed to the California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's energy grid and is charged with buying power when necessary to avert shortages. However, the ISO doesn't have any power-purchasing money of its own, and the major parties it would normally bill are PG&E and Edison, whose inability to pay their power bills was the reason the state started buying electricity in the first place. Amid criticism of its stance from generators, utilities and Wall Street, the DWR says it has started covering more of the utilities' electricity costs. The water agency is now buying 95% to 99% of what California needs in a given day, says the agency's Mr. Hart. But increased buying only adds to the uncertainty about the eventual tab. The state's legislative analyst, Elizabeth Hill, recently recommended that lawmakers hold off considering more than $2 billion in state spending on items ranging from college construction to beach cleanups because of continuing questions about the financial impact of the electricity crisis. Like others, Ms. Hill complains that the governor's office and state agencies haven't been forthcoming with information. Indeed, the DWR refuses to say precisely how much power it is purchasing and at what prices, though it has on several occasions gone back to the Legislature for more money. State officials say that data on its purchasing activities would give suppliers an advantage in continuing electricity-supply contract talks. State Controller Kathleen Connell, who is running for mayor of Los Angeles in an April election, recently announced plans to post state power-spending information on her department's Web site. But within 24 hours, Ms. Connell suspended that plan after discussions with senior Davis administration officials. ""I feel very strongly that this information should be publicly released,"" says Ms. Connell. ""I just don't want to do anything that would weaken the state's effectiveness in negotiating."" In an effort to more tightly control events, the governor obtained legislative approval to abolish the 26-member ISO board, which was made up of everyone from utility executives to representatives of consumer groups. He then appointed a new five-member board. To ensure a quick transition, the California attorney general threatened the old board members with fines of as much as $5,000 each if they didn't immediately relinquish their positions. All did. ""I was offended"" at the ""heavy-handed"" treatment, says Karen Johanson, a former ISO board member. One of the first acts of the ISO's new board was to close a meeting about the electricity crisis. The former ISO board routinely held such meetings in public. ISO attorneys say the meeting was largely designed as a private briefing for new board members and that the organization is committed to keeping its deliberations as open as possible. The Wall Street Journal and other news organizations have unsuccessfully challenged the closure in Sacramento state court. Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Donnelly could lead to a= =20 mass exodus by hundreds of small energy producers that have been selling=20 power to the state's financially troubled utilities for months without=20 getting paid. ?????At the same time, it may have staved off plans by a group of the small= =20 generators to send Edison into involuntary bankruptcy as early as today. ?????In Sacramento, energy legislation pushed by Gov. Gray Davis passed in= =20 the state Senate but foundered in the Assembly. The measure was intended to= =20 ensure that the state gets repaid for the electricity that it has been buyi= ng=20 on behalf of Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric, which say they lack the cas= h=20 and credit to purchase power. The bill also was supposed to guarantee that= =20 the small, alternative energy producers--which together provide nearly a=20 third of the state's power--get paid. But Assembly Republicans opposed it,= =20 saying it hadn't been given sufficient scrutiny. ?????The impact of the small producers was made clear in Imperial County,= =20 where Edison's failure to pay CalEnergy, the county's biggest property=20 taxpayer, had outsize implications. CalEnergy had put county officials on= =20 notice that it was about to miss a $3.8-million property tax payment. The= =20 uncertainty had prompted the tiny Calipatria Unified School District to=20 postpone a bond issue for badly needed school repairs. ?????Among CalEnergy Chairman David Sokol's first acts after the judge's=20 ruling Thursday was to promise Imperial County Supervisor Wally J. Leimgrub= er=20 that the company would pay its property taxes on time. ?????""That is great news,"" Leimgruber said. ?????Within hours of its court victory, CalEnergy had stopped transmitting= =20 geothermal power to Edison and begun selling it to El Paso Energy, a=20 marketing company that purchased the energy at prevailing rates and resold = it=20 on the spot market. ?????Some of the more than 700 other small energy producers in the state sa= id=20 they were considering similar action against Edison and Pacific Gas &=20 Electric. ?????""We absolutely need the right to sell to third parties,"" said Dean=20 Vanech, president of Delta Power, a New Jersey company that owns five small= =20 gas-fired plants in California and is owed tens of millions of dollars by= =20 Edison. ?????Sokol praised the Imperial County judge and said his company simply=20 wanted the authority to sell its power ""to a credit-worthy company that, in= =20 fact, pays for the power."" ?????An Edison spokesman said the company was disappointed with the ruling,= =20 but sympathized with CalEnergy and other small producers because=20 ""California's power crisis has placed [them] in financial distress, just as= =20 it has placed utilities in financial distress."" ?????Edison expressed concern that the ruling would prompt CalEnergy and=20 other small producers to sell their power out of state. Sokol said CalEnerg= y=20 had specifically told El Paso Energy that it hoped its power would remain i= n=20 California, ""but if someone wants to pay a higher price out of state, we=20 can't stop them."" ?????Sokol said that Edison still owes CalEnergy $140 million and that the= =20 company--along with seven other small producers--had been prepared to file = a=20 petition in federal bankruptcy court in Los Angeles today forcing the utili= ty=20 into involuntary bankruptcy. He said his company no longer intends to do so= ,=20 and he believed--but wasn't certain--that the other companies would shelve= =20 their plans. ?????Edison filed papers Thursday with the federal Securities and Exchange= =20 Commission showing that it owed $840 million to various small electricity= =20 producers, many of which rely on renewable energy sources such as geotherma= l=20 steam, solar energy or wind. ?????The alternative energy producers--and utilities--strenuously objected = to=20 the legislation considered in Sacramento on Thursday. The bill, spelling ou= t=20 how the utilities are to pay the state and the small producers, passed the= =20 Senate on a 27-9 vote, the exact two-thirds margin required. But it stalled= =20 in the Assembly on a 46-23 party-line vote, well short of two-thirds. ?????""When I was a citizen back in Lancaster, I heard these stories about= =20 pieces of legislation that were cooked up late at night, that . . . were cu= t=20 and pasted together and were rammed through by the Legislature,"" Assemblyma= n=20 George Runner (R-Lancaster) said.

Subject:: SCE Counter Claim -- Underreporting of Volumes -- Confidential --
	 Attorney Work Product
Body:: After speaking with George Phillips yesterday about SCE's counterclaim against EES and EEMC regarding underreporting of usage to the ISO, I think there may be some internal confusion (of which I may have contributed to) about the nature of SCE's counterclaim. As I understand, from my review of certain documents received from SCE in response to our data requests, review of an ""Executive Summary"" prepared by George Phillips on the issue, and from my conversation with him yesterday, EES and EEMC, as a result of some problems with their settlement system, did indeed underreport customers' usage to the ISO during the time period claimed by SCE. This has, I believe, resulted in two separate (although interrelated) points of contention with SCE -- of which only one is the subject matter of its counterclaim. First, the underreporting resulted in Unaccounted For Energy (UFE) charges to the market. In correspondence sent by SCE to EEMC and EES during the last quarter of 2001, it appears that SCE was calculating the ""cost to the market"" from the EES/EEMC underreporting by applying the hourly day ahead market clearing price to the individual hourly variances. This cost to the market is overestimated, however, as SCE failed to take into account the fact that the ISO nets underreported amounts against overreported accounts to get a net amount of underreporting. This underreported amount is then allocated to all providers of physical load within a service territory through the assessment of UFE charges. Thus whatever the ultimate cost was determined to be, SCE would not be allocated the entire amount. Second, the underreporting of usage to the ISO results, according to SCE, in SCE paying EES and EEMC a PX credit for energy they never purchased. This claim is separate and apart from what SCE claims EES/EEMC cost the market in the way of UFE charges. What SCE is saying is that it believes that EES and EEMC only purchased on behalf of their customers the amount of energy which they reported to the ISO. EES' and EEMC's customers actually used more than the amount which EES and EEMC reported. SCE calculated the PX credit based on the amount used, not reported. It is SCE's claim that EES and EEMC are not entitled to a PX credit on the delta as the market, not EES and EEMC, purchased those volumes. It is only the second point of contention which is the subject matter of SCE's counterclaim. SCE is alleging that it should not have to pay a PX credit to EES and EEMC for volumes that EES and EEMC did not purchase. SCE is claiming that we only purchased the amount we reported to the ISO. While SCE may believe that it should not have to pay any UFE charges as the result of EES/EEMC underreporting, the UFE charges are not the basis of its counterclaim. Based on the above analysis, I think that the most critical piece of information to refute the counterclaim is that, despite the underreporting of volumes to the ISO, EES and EEMC actually purchased on behalf of their DA customers those customers' full usage. Can we make such claim? and do we have data to back it up? Jeanne Bennett

Under Steve Hopper's leadership, the Chorety spill became a non-issue by Friday. During the crisis, I collaborated with my counterpart from Shell/London, Michael Megarry, in developing a Key Messages and Internal Q&As document (attached). At the daily meeting/conference call, there was an Operations Report from the site, an analysis of the day's newspaper articles (which I handled), and discussions on how to respond to media that were reporting or airing inaccurate information that was damaging Transredes' image. I also developed a Stakeholders Action Plan (attached) for the Incident Commander to use in organizing and monitoring team member actions taken in response to stakeholder concerns. The Plan was updated daily by the Transredes PR Office and given to team members prior to every meeting/conference call. The Stakeholder Report is intended to complement the Operations Report. I also want to acknowledge the support of Karen and Dennis during the early stages of the crisis. It was extremely helpful. Regards, Keith

Subject:: Re: FW: fact sheet- latest draft
Body:: I think it's a good document and carves out some solid policy ground for Bush. I think the electricity section needs some additions though. There is not a lot that the current administration can do about siting new plants and power lines -- its largely a state and local decision. Further, the problem has been less about government failing to provide adequate incentives to utilities than it has been about a failure of the current commission to opening the grid on a nondiscriminatory basis. Once utilities are in the open access transmission business they will look for ways to invest in the grid and stop getting in the way of independent power producers who want to connect to the grid. The answer is open access, so power can get from where it is to where it is needed. This has been clear for a long time, yet the current administration (and its appointees on FERC) have yet to use their authority to make this happen. The result: spiking prices and reliability problems.

Davis's Plan To Power California --- State's Outlays for Electricity May Be Hard to Recover Without Rate Increases --- Betting on Long-Term Deals ------------------------ Breakthrough made in rescue of PG&E State ready to pay $7 billion for lines By Steve Geissinger SACRAMENTO BUREAU SACRAMENTO -- Signaling a breakthrough in secret energy crisis talks, the Davis administration disclosed Tuesday it may announce the framework of a pact to rescue the teetering Pacific Gas and Electric Co. next week. ""Things are going very well,"" said Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis. The state appears to be poised to pay at least $7 billion -- and possibly billions more -- for PG&E's high-voltage transmission lines as part of a deal to financially renovate the north-state utility, according to sources familiar with the negotiations. But consumer advocates insisted that even the $7 billion price is too much to pay. And experts warned that a deal with PG&E will be more complex than with other utilities. PG&E representatives declined comment, in keeping with their policy on the talks, even though the Davis administration said an announcement could come as early as next week or the following week. The new timetable for an announcement was substantially sooner than in Davis' original forecast. Until late last week, PG&E was still resisting the sale of its power grid despite the fact that Davis had announced the framework of an agreement with Southern California Edison. Davis expects to soon announce a similar deal with the San Diego Gas and Electric Co. However, any such deal still would need federal approval. The investor-owned utilities, trapped between high wholesale costs and lower, regulated retail rates, amassed nearly $13 billion in debts and were unable to buy electricity this winter. With the onset of rolling blackouts, the state began brokering billions of dollars in emergency short- and long-term power purchases. Davis' strategy to ease the energy price and supply crisis includes bolstering both conservation and generation while fiscally refurbishing the nearly bankrupt utilities. As part of the rescue deal, the utilities would have to drop legal actions seeking dramatically higher electricity bills, environmentally shield wildlands they own, sell power from their generators to Californians for the next decade and secure help with their debts from their parent companies. Together with the cash infusion from the sale of their power 26,000-mile power grids, the utilities would be allowed to sell bonds to raise funds and use customer money to pay them off. The state would upgrade the high-voltage lines and lease them back to the utilities for operation. In a reflection of the negotiations with the three utilities, a Davis administration official said the deal with PG&E is proving to be more complex than with the other firms. Though PG&E finally agreed late last week to sell its transmission grid, the utility apparently wants more than the $7 billion that Davis has offered, according to sources. The figure is more than twice the book amount, or the value placed on the system for purposes of accounting. And that's the markup that lured Edison into an agreement to sell its smaller portion of the transmission grid for $2.8 billion. But PG&E, which fears an erosion of its economic base, may be asking as much as $10 billion. Due to complexities in the state's 1996 deregulation of the industry, PG&E is more likely to lose revenue than Edison as a result of selling its transmission lines, according to experts. Big customers might be able to bypass the utility's remaining local distribution lines, thereby eroding its customer base. Therefore the utility may view bankruptcy, and sale of its transmission lines to the highest bidder, as a potentially attractive alternative to selling its share of the grid to the state at too low a price. ---- El Paso Energy closes six valley power plants Filed: 03/07/2001 By CHIP POWER, Californian staff writer e-mail: ppower@bakersfield.com El Paso Energy, citing non-payment from Pacific Gas & Electric Co., said it has shut down six cogeneration plants this week. The smaller plants produced about 175 megawatts of electricity and are located primarily in the San Joaquin Valley, said company spokesman Mel Scott. A megawatt can supply power to 1,000 homes. At least 10 plants have closed in the past two weeks as a result of non-payment, according to the state Independent System Operator, which manages most of the state's electrical distribution. The El Paso Energy plants are operated with various partners and had not been compensated for December, January and February deliveries, said Scott. He said he did not know the total amount due but said the plants would be closed until PG&E's credit worthiness is improved. A cogeneration plant, common in oil fields, simultaneously produces heat energy and electrical or mechanical power from the same fuel in the same facility. Typically, it produces electricity and steam, which can be deployed to enhance oil recovery. Kern County is the state's leading oil-producing county. El Paso owns or has interests in more than 40,000 miles of interstate and intrastate pipeline connecting the nation's principal natural gas supply regions to the five largest consuming regions in the United States, namely the Gulf Coast, California, the Northeast, the Midwest and the Southeast. El Paso closed up 99 cents on Tuesday, or 1.4 percent, at $71.49. The Houston-based company's stock price has ranged between $36.31 and $75.30 in the last 52 weeks. ---- Still undecided: Who'll pay DWR for electricity By Karen Gaudette ASSOCIATED PRESS SAN FRANCISCO -- The price tag is $3.2 billion and counting for electricity bought by the state Department of Water Resources for the customers of two nearly bankrupt utilities. Pacific Gas and Electric Co., Southern California Edison and the state disagree over how the DWR eventually will be reimbursed for its purchases on the expensive last-minute power market. So do the state power regulators, who have the final call over who gets the money when. Under a recent law, the DWR went into the electricity-buying business to help keep the two utilities from sinking further into their $13 billion debt. The state plans to retrieve the money by selling $10 billion in revenue bonds. The utilities continue to collect ratepayer dollars on that electricity, which the bill's author, Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, says is meant to help them begin paying down their debt. In a recent letter, however, DWR officials requested that the state Public Utilities Commission order that a portion of that money be diverted to the state. But after the utilities subtract the costs of generating electricity, payments to environmentally friendly power plants and other expenses, there is no money left from ratepayer dollars to give to the DWR without sinking further into debt, PG&E spokesman Ron Low said Tuesday. If it passed along money to the DWR, ""our undercollection would grow by about $2.4 billion by the end of the year,"" Low said. The commission, unable to agree on the best course of action, left the issue untouched at its last meeting but expects to revisit the issue when it meets this morning. Commissioner Richard Bilas is proposing an alternate plan that would have the DWR set its own revenue requirements that would be passed on to ratepayers. The PUC also is expected to respond to complaints from laid-off workers and customers that layoffs by utilities to cut costs have been hurting service. Commissioner Carl Wood warned at the last meeting that failure to provide safe and reliable service could mean fines for the utilities. Representatives from electrical workers unions, the PUC and the utilities were to discuss the issue Tuesday afternoon. ""I don't think we believe that utilities can find a way out of their problems by laying off workers,"" said Mindy Spatt, a spokeswoman with the Utility Reform Network. ""We think consumers deserve safe and reliable service, and we think they deserve it at a reasonable price."" ---- State Taxpayers In Dark on Details Of Energy Deal David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer Wednesday, March 7, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle Few people would purchase a car simply because the dealer said, ''Trust me, it's a great deal.'' Yet Gov. Gray Davis essentially is telling Californians just that about dozens of long-term power contracts. Because of confidentiality agreements with power companies, the governor has revealed only scant details about the state's multibillion-dollar contracts for electricity over the next 10 years. ""Gov. Davis has our money, and we can't see how he's spending it,"" said Doug Heller, a spokesman for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. ""We've been locked out of the room."" Neither Davis nor power companies would divulge specific details about the price, duration or scope of individual contracts. Each cited secrecy clauses that the governor's office said had been desired by both sides. What consumers do know is this: -- California has signed 40 contracts and tentative accords, valued at about $40 billion, to secure enough power to light 9 million homes over the next decade. -- The average purchase price of each deal is $69 per megawatt hour -- well above the $30 to $40 charged by power generators before California's energy market went haywire last summer. -- If, as is widely expected, wholesale power prices fall in years ahead, the state nevertheless will be locked into paying above-market rates for electricity. But it is not known which generator agreed to part with the most power at the cheapest level or the full range of the prices in concocting the $69 average. Moreover, it is unclear how shrewdly the state negotiated with taxpayer money in securing power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities. ""These agreements are the bedrock of our long-term energy policy,"" Davis said Monday in announcing the deals. The governor's office defended the murky nature of the contracts yesterday. ""It's a business transaction in which private corporate information is included,"" said Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Davis. ""That's the kind of information that never gets revealed."" While additional elements of the contracts will be publicized in coming months, he said, the contracts themselves will remain a secret. ""You'll never see all the details,"" Maviglio said. This did not sit well with many observers. ""It's a breach of public trust,"" said Daniel Bacon, a San Francisco attorney specializing in business law. ""A public servant spending public money shouldn't be able to keep the spending secret."" But Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an energy-industry association in Menlo Park, called confidentiality agreements ""a necessary evil in transactions like this."" He explained that no power company would agree to a long-term contract if rival firms could learn the terms of the accord. The company would be losing too much of its competitive edge in the marketplace, Ackerman said. At the same time, he noted that secrecy allowed the buyer -- in this case, California taxpayers -- to secure more favorable terms with individual sellers. A high price with one generator would not necessarily be sought by all power providers. Still, the fact that public funds are being used makes confidentiality in this case a different matter than, say, Cisco Systems' quietly negotiating to take over yet another tech rival. ""The public is in a very awkward position,"" said Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. ""It has to rely on the good word and expertise of the governor, and he has yet to demonstrate that he has expertise or good word in this field."" Shames likened consumers to passengers in a plane being flown by a pilot without a license to fly. ""But what choice do we have?"" he asked. ""I don't see many other options available right now."" There's the rub. No matter how bad a deal California may have cut to help meet its energy demands, the alternative -- blackouts, disruptions, economic catastrophe -- is far, far worse. On the other hand, it already appears that the new contracts will not shield Californians from the threat of daily outages this summer, when demand surges. Davis said only about 60 percent of the state's summertime electricity needs so far had been met. Part of the reason is that many power companies already have contracted for their output this year. Duke Energy said this was why it would not begin its nine-year contract with California until 2002, while Williams Cos. said it would only gradually increase the amount of available wattage in its 10-year contract. Both companies, meanwhile, will continue to profit this summer by selling into the volatile ""spot"" market, where wholesale power went for as much as $1, 500 per megawatt hour last year. ""You can't sell all your power into long-term contracts,"" said Paula Hall- Collins, a Williams spokeswoman. ""You save some for the spot market."" Consumer groups worry that consumers will be hammered again this summer with sky-high power prices, and then get nailed down the road by contracts for above-market rates. ""If we could look at the terms of the deals, we'd see that California is being gouged for 10 years,"" said Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. ""But the governor doesn't want us to see that."" Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum said the state had gotten the best rates it could under current market conditions. ""California went for long-term contracts when everyone else moved in as well,"" he said. ""Californians are paying a price for not acting sooner."" ---- Lawmakers pitch fixes for region's energy woes By David Whitney Bee Washington Bureau (Published March 7, 2001) WASHINGTON -- California members of Congress pleaded for everything from wholesale price caps to extending daylight-saving time an extra hour to help the region cope this summer with its persistent electricity shortage, but none of the ideas seemed to catch fire at a House hearing Tuesday. ""People will die in California because of this crisis,"" Rep. Brad Sherman, a Los Angeles-area Republican, warned the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Sherman testified that his idea for saving lives is to extend daylight-saving time by an extra hour, so that there would be more daylight at the end of the day when power consumption surges. ""One of the peak demand periods for electricity occurs between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m., when the sun sets and people come home from work,"" Sherman testified. ""If people come home and it is light out, there is less of an inclination to turn a light on."" Sherman said the state Legislature has called for congressional approval for states to be given authority to extend daylight-saving time, and he cited analyses by the California Energy Commission and other agencies suggesting that it could cut power consumption by 1 percent to 2 percent. Sherman, who was one of about a dozen California lawmakers presenting their views on the energy squeeze, drew no questions from committee leaders about what his legislation might do to everything from airline schedules to television programming if West Coast states didn't agree on the same time standard. Most of the committee's questioning was on the more popular idea proposed by several California and Western lawmakers, primarily Democrats, to require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose caps on wholesale electricity prices that have gone wild because of a regional power shortage. Rep. Bob Filner, D-San Diego, charged that the price spiral has little to do with power shortages but a lot to do with a ""small cartel"" of generators bilking ratepayers. Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., said he brought up the idea of regional price caps with President Bush, who was initially skeptical. But Inslee said that Bush warmed to the idea after being told that protections could be built into the caps so as not to discourage construction of new power plants. Upon hearing that, Inslee said, Bush invited him to meet with the president's Cabinet-level task force led by Vice President Dick Cheney on a national energy strategy. But Inslee said he can't get the group to meet with him. ""It's very disappointing,"" Inslee said. Tuesday's hearing was part of a series the panel is holding on the California crisis, so far without any emerging consensus on what, if anything, Congress should do. ---- Power plan called wrong Wall Street analysts say the governor's approach to the problem avoids the issue that caused the imbalance. March 7, 2001 By DON THOMPSON The Associated Press SACRAMENTO California's scramble to insulate consumers from the soaring price of electricity may add to the state's power problems this summer, Wall Street analysts said Tuesday. Gov. Gray Davis' emphasis on buying utilities' transmission lines and negotiating long-term power contracts to help ease their debts skirts the deep imbalance between wholesale and market rates that led to the state's power problems in the first place, they said. ""In the long run, it doesn't solve anything,"" said Michael Worms, an industry analyst for Gerard Klauer Mattison & Co. ""In the long run, you need to send the right price signals to consumers, which will create its own conservation signals. Unfortunately, customers were shielded from that in California."" Davis said Monday that the state's first contracts to buy electricity for two financially struggling utilities will provide only about two-thirds of the power needed on a typical summer day, forcing Californians to cut power use at least 10 percent to avoid blackouts. Since early January, the state has been buying one- third of the power Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. customers need. The two utilities, denied credit by suppliers, say they have lost nearly $14 billion due to soaring wholesale electricity prices that the state's industry-deregulation law says they cannot pass on to consumers. The keepers of the state power grid had enough electricity Tuesday to avoid declaring an electricity alert, but have faced an almost-daily scramble for weeks due to a tight supply and high wholesale prices. Several wholesale and retail rate proposals are circulating. Among them: Free-market advocates such as Worms want an immediate end to the deregulation-imposed retail rate freeze on Edison and PG&E that will expire next year. Davis wants a Western price cap of $100 per megawatt hour on power generators he says have been prof iteering from California's short energy supply. The Bush administration and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission are cool to that idea. In December, FERC imposed a ""soft cap"" of $150 per megawatt hour on wholesale rates in the state and required suppliers to justify any higher prices they charge. Consumer groups such as The Utility Reform Network, or TURN, want regulated rates for residential and small-business customers, but free-market rates for large industrial customers, which sought deregulation in the first place. TURN also advocates a tiered rate structure, with higher rates for consumers who use more than a reasonable amount of electricity each month. Assembly Republicans say electricity and natural-gas prices will fall naturally if the state increases supply, mainly by making it easier to build plants and pipelines. ""Right now, you're sort of sitting partially with regulation and part with the free market,"" said Paul Fremont, an analyst with Jefferies & Co. ""Both these systems work. It's sort of that in-between system that you have in Califor nia that doesn't appear to be working."" The system discourages generators from building new power plants because they aren't guaranteed a profit, and it doesn't do enough to discourage power use by consumers because the price they pay doesn't reflect the true cost of power, Fremont said. ""I don't think people here have much faith in the market, and why should they?"" countered TURN's Mindy Spatt. ""I think there are probably better ways of encouraging consumers to conserve than by gouging them."" Davis insists the crisis can be resolved without raising rates for Edison and PG&E customers beyond ""the existing rate structure."" In January, state regulators imposed temporary rate hikes of 7 to 15 percent on Edison and PG&E customers. The Legislature and Davis extended the increases for up to a decade to help pay back the estimated $10 billion in power buying the state expects to do for Edison and PG&E over the next several years, and finance its purchase of the power lines owned by the two companies and San Diego Gas & Electric. Rates were already scheduled to increase next year for Edison and PG&E customers. Under the 1996 deregulation law, the pair's ratepayers saw a 10 percent rate reduction, but only until early 2002. That rate cut will likely expire as planned, Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio has said. Davis wants those rates to cover not only the traditional cost of generating, transporting and distributing power, but the added cost of paying off the two utilities' massive debt and buying their transmission lines, said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, the Assembly's chief power negotiator. Yet Davis has indirectly addressed the rate imbalance by signing legislation that will let regulators raise consumer rates if necessary, Keeley said. The governor and lawmakers are in effect spreading out rate increases over a decade by using long-term revenue bonds to buy power for the nearly bankrupt utilities, said Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy Institute. ""At some point we have to deal with the reality that all of the power that we buy has to be paid for by somebody - it's either going to come from taxpayers or it's going to come from ratepayers,"" Bor enstein said. ""Raising rates now would get us a lot of conservation."" Davis also wants financial incentives for conservation and power-plant construction in time to make a difference this summer. ""Our mouths were agape"" at the rapid timetable, Keeley said. Legislators are rushing to pass those incentives by month's end, he said, allowing three months for consumers and suppliers to act before the heat of summer. Among bills considered Tuesday, the Senate Energy Committee approved legislation to accelerate the siting of power plants. It also was considering a proposal to restructure rates for generators that use renewable energy to provide about 30 percent of the state's electricity. ---- Bill to Cut Some Power Prices Stalls Energy: Democrats balk at varying payment levels for alternative generators. By DAN MORAIN, JULIE TAMAKI, Times Staff Writers SACRAMENTO--Legislation aimed at cutting prices for more than a fourth of the power consumed in California stalled Tuesday, as Democrats questioned why a few alternative energy generators--some of them campaign donors--stood to receive higher payments than others. Lawmakers working to unravel California's energy mess have been negotiating for weeks in an effort to cut the price paid to more than 600 generators of alternative power by more than half, to below 8 cents a kilowatt-hour. Those alternative generators' contracts with utilities have shot up in recent months because of a rise in the price of natural gas. The cash-strapped corporations have suspended or made partial payments to the generators over the last few months, causing many to shut down or reduce their outputs. But even as the lawmakers reached agreement that pushed the average price to near the 8-cent level per kilowatt-hour, some generators would have received higher prices under the bill by state Sen. Jim Battin (R-La Quinta). Some of the generators that stood to benefit had donated to Battin's campaigns. One--Windtec Inc.--gave Battin a $20,000 campaign donation in 1999. Others contributed from $3,000 and $5,000 last year. Battin acknowledged that he has received campaign contributions from some wind power generators but said there is no connection between the donations and the bill's provisions. ""It is illegal, it is unethical and it's not how I do business,"" he said. Battin noted that 25% of the state's alternative energy producers are in his district. As Democrats on the Senate Energy Committee blocked the bill, Battin warned that some alternative energy producers might react to the delay by trying to force Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric into bankruptcy. ""We will be the cause of bankruptcy,"" Battin said. That prompted Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) to retort: ""I'm really tired of being threatened with bankruptcy."" Alternative energy producers, including those that use wind, solar power, biomass and other means, produce 27% of the energy used in California. They sell the electricity to the utilities, which in turn transmit it to retail consumers. But with the utilities facing multibillion-dollar debts, the alternative energy producers under contract with Edison have not been paid since November. Scores of alternative energy producers supported the measure. Edison International and the San Francisco-based consumer group, the Utility Reform Network, opposed it. Michael Florio of the Utility Reform group said the deal could result in higher consumer prices; an Edison representative said the same thing. Battin and Assemblyman Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek) worked out an arrangement with many of the generators. Keeley took the lead in the early negotiations, and then turned to Battin to introduce the legislation, SB 47X. Rather convoluted language would have allowed higher payments to a select few generators that produce electricity from wind and biomass. Most of California's wind suppliers, for instance, would have received about 6 cents per kilowatt-hour. But a handful of them, about half a dozen wind farms--mostly in the Palm Springs area represented by Battin--would have received 7.8 cents. Battin contends that other wind producers receive additional payments that boost them to the same level as Windtec and others that would get the higher payments. ""They get the same deal,"" Battin said of the handful of generators that would benefit from the provisions he added to the bill. In California's overall energy market, the amount of money that would have flowed to the favored generators is minor. But the added prices that would have been paid to the generators would have translated to at least $19 million in the next five years, to be absorbed by Southern California Edison customers, according to one analysis. Also Tuesday, more details were disclosed about another leg of the state's effort to escape from the energy crunch--the deals with large power generators to supply electricity to California for as long as 10 years. Those arrangements were announced by Gov. Gray Davis Monday as ""the bedrock"" of California's energy policy. But some consumer advocates warned that the deals could lock the state into excessively high-priced contracts. S. David Freeman, the general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Davis' negotiator, said that the state guarded against that by varying the time spans of its deals. About 6,000 megawatts are expected to be available this summer, about one-third of the energy needed by the state, Freeman said. The amount of power under contract swells until more than 9,000 megawatts are contracted in 2004, half of the needed amount, before dipping to 8,000 megawatts in 2010. ""What we're doing here is what everybody said had to be done,"" Freeman said. ""We deliberately bought 50% so we'd have a good mix between long-term contracts, which may turn out to be somewhat higher or somewhat lower than the spot market,"" and purchases on the spot market. ---- PG&E could face mutiny on outages: SMUD, others may balk if utility orders summer blackouts By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer (Published March 7, 2001) Sacramento's electric utility wants out of a deal that imposes rolling blackouts locally on PG&E's command. So do a lot of other utilities. They've been writing letters, lobbying lawmakers and launching informal talks with Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to get off the hook before summer. Who dodges the blackout bullet ""is going to play out as a political hot button"" around the state, said George Fraser, head of the Northern California Power Agency, a coalition of municipal utilities. In Sacramento, the next volley is expected soon, with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District reportedly poised to notify PG&E that it will no longer black out homes and businesses on the larger utility's command. ""We are absolutely trying to fight off the requirement for rolling blackouts for the Sacramento area,"" said Linda Davis, one of seven elected members of the SMUD board of directors. Saying they don't want to be dragged down by somebody else's problems, two Southern California utilities have written grid operators asking to be exempted from any blackouts caused by PG&E's or Southern California Edison's financial woes. But in PG&E's view, ""California is in an energy crisis (and) ... we're all in this together,"" said spokesman John Nelson. The maneuvering comes amid bleak forecasts for power supplies this summer. Although Gov. Gray Davis has said conservation, new power plants and moderate weather could avert blackouts, officials at the Independent System Operator, which runs much of California's grid, expect frequent rotating outages. One consulting firm, Cambridge Energy Research Associates, predicts 20 hours of rolling blackouts during July and August, and about 200 hours of especially intense calls for voluntary cutbacks. Before blackouts hit, the jockeying over just whose lights, air conditioners and assembly lines will be shut down is growing. The outcome could affect millions of people statewide. The state Public Utilities Commission is probing rolling blackout programs run by the for-profit utilities it regulates, including PG&E and Edison. A PUC analysis has suggested that PG&E's program, which currently exempts about 40 percent of its customers, should spread the burden more broadly. For example, it said, 1.9 million homes and businesses are spared just because they share a circuit with a customer deemed ""essential."" But not-for-profit utilities such as SMUD, which answer to their own elected boards or city councils, have other worries. Many have already lined up their power supplies for summer. Some have raised rates or are considering raising rates. Some have taken extra conservation steps. They think those preparations ought to give them leverage to ease blackout clauses in their contracts with PG&E. SMUD general manager Jan Schori ""is going to use every avenue ... any avenue, to put pressure on,"" including lobbying the ISO, the governor and others, said utility director Davis. The Northern California Power Agency, a joint-powers authority that owns and operates power plants for municipal utilities, has begun informal negotiations with PG&E to change blackout rules, according to Fraser, its top executive. It is preparing to write PG&E, asking that its members be exempted from outages altogether. Failing that, it wants them to face fewer outages or to be compensated for cutting off power, he said. At SMUD, the utility board has met in closed session to discuss exactly what it is required to do during electric emergencies, under terms of the interconnection contract that links SMUD's lines to PG&E's. ""The contracts are being inspected with a fine-tooth comb,"" said SMUD director Howard Posner. Schori declined to comment on any specifics. Sources indicated that the main option being considered is notifying PG&E that because of changed circumstances, SMUD believes it no longer is required to routinely comply with outage requests. Other options being explored include re-negotiating existing agreements with PG&E. Posner said that ever since two days of rolling blackouts in January, constituents have been asking him, "" 'Why are we participating when we're not the problem?' And I don't have a good answer to that."" Several directors said SMUD has already spent a lot of money -- and is considering 16 percent rate increases -- to ensure that it has enough electricity under contract to meet its customers' summer demands. They believe PG&E should do the same. ""We're almost like a David against Goliath here,"" said board vice president Genevieve Shiroma. ""The huge investor-owned utilities next door have severe problems that they need to get under control."" In addition, SMUD plans to argue that because it can cut usage through its ""Peak Corps"" program, which remotely turns off air conditioners at volunteer households, it has already done its part without rotating outages, director Davis said. PG&E believes the interconnection agreements that govern smaller utilities' ties to its transmission lines have ""benefits and burdens to both sides,"" said Nelson. ""It wouldn't be fair or good policy for just one provision to be altered without taking a look at how that affects the entire contract,"" he said. Interconnection contracts generally have clauses that require utilities to help each other out to avert greater emergencies. Sometimes reducing demand -- called load shedding -- can be the only way to stabilize the electric grid in the seconds after a major power plant or transmission line fails. ""It's been around in the electrical fabric forever,"" said Jim Pope, head of Silicon Valley Power, Santa Clara's city-run utility. In addition to legal requirements, ""you have a moral obligation so you don't bring the system to collapse."" Like other city-run utilities, Silicon Valley Power has a contract with PG&E that requires it to shed load during an electric emergency. But its contract allows it to work with big users to reduce their demand, so no one has to be completely shut off. Such agreements, formed long before deregulation when PG&E ran the north state's grid, now are complicated by the 1997 creation of the state Independent System Operator. The ISO today runs pieces of the grid owned by PG&E, Edison, and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. If it believes power use is about to surge past supply, potentially triggering a grid collapse across the western United States, the ISO notifies the three utilities that they have to shed a certain number of megawatts. The big utilities meet that requirement two ways. They cut circuits to some of their own customers, and they tell smaller, connected utilities to cut a proportionate share. In Northern California, about 80 percent of the outages are borne by PG&E customers and the rest by customers of SMUD and other municipal utilities and irrigation districts. ""In one sense, we are all in this together. If SMUD were in danger of going down, we would hope others would help us out,"" said SMUD's Posner. ""But that's if we're in danger from circumstances beyond our control, not from mismanagement or lack of financial wherewithal."" It is unclear what penalties, if any, a utility would face for violating an interconnection agreement. In the long run, the issue would be fought either in the courts or before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, grid officials said. As a practical matter, in the seconds when the risk to the grid is greatest, if one utility refused to shed load, the ISO would probably solve to problem by calling on PG&E, Edison or others who are willing to make deeper cutbacks, they said. ---- PUC to Decide Fate Of Utility Workers PG&E, Edison want to trim costs by laying off thousands, cutting service Bernadette Tansey, Chronicle Staff Writer Wednesday, March 7, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle State regulators are set to decide today whether debt-ridden Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison can conserve cash by laying off thousands of workers and letting service standards slip. Union officials who protested the layoffs before the California Public Utilities Commission warn that if the cuts go through, neighborhoods hit by power outages could stay dark for hours, and more customers could face busy signals when they call about their bills. An administrative law judge agreed, advising the commission in February to order the utilities to restore 725 positions already cut and block the elimination of an additional 2,125 jobs. Judge John Wong said PG&E and Edison have acknowledged the layoffs will not substantially improve their shaky financial condition, which arose from skyrocketing wholesale electricity costs the utilities could not pass on to consumers under a rate cap. ""The savings would barely make a dent,"" Wong said in his draft decision. The two companies together claim that their debt from power purchases amounts to more than $13 billion. PG&E says it has saved $18 million from the first wave of 325 layoffs. Wong's recommendation is already running into resistance on the PUC. Commissioner Richard Bilas said the five-member panel should not be micromanaging the utilities in a time of crisis. Bilas has proposed an alternate ruling that would allow the utilities to make the cuts, but provide for PUC monitoring of service in case the commission wants to step in later. ""We're in a situation where the utilities are not collecting the revenues they need to operate, and yet we may be guilty of not letting them cut expenses where they can cut expenses,"" Bilas said. PG&E spokesman Jon Tremayne said savings from the layoffs are helping to keep electricity running and gas flowing. ""It keeps cash in our accounts so we can keep doing day-to-day business,"" Tremayne said. In addition to the 325 positions dropped so far, PG&E is proposing to cut an additional 675 during the next three to six months. The cuts affect temporary and contract workers who read meters, handle new service hookups and replace equipment. PG&E has no plans to eliminate permanent positions. The company is struggling to keep up with a higher workload at its call center as customers deluge the lines with inquiries about their rising bills and the effects of deregulation. Calls to PG&E ballooned from 1.3 million in January 2000 to 2.3 million in January 2001. Bilas advocates granting PG&E's request to temporarily relax standards requiring the utility to respond swiftly to customer calls and to read customers' meters once a month. PG&E wants to read meters bimonthly and send bills based on the estimated use between readings. Discrepancies could be corrected later. Wong called those measures unacceptable. He said customers need to know immediately if their efforts to conserve power are working. Wong also said the utilities' own experts have said the workforce reductions will lengthen the time required to restore power after nonemergency equipment failure. Eric Wolfe, communications director for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 1245, said some customers have already been left without power overnight because PG&E is trying to avoid the use of overtime on nonemergency power outages. ""It hurts a lineman to walk away from the job leaving a customer without power,"" Wolfe said. Tremayne said PG&E is trying to minimize overtime costs, but denied the company has allowed customers to go without power out of financial concerns. He said crews were pulled out when darkness and falling trees made the work too dangerous. ---- Power prices could soar during the summer Posted at 10:35 p.m. PST Tuesday, March 6, 2001 BY STEVE JOHNSON Mercury News Unless Gov. Gray Davis arranges significantly more long-term electricity contracts or persuades people to turn off a lot more lights, California's unpredictable spot market for power could wreak havoc this summer. Even with the 40 long-term deals announced by Davis on Monday, experts interviewed Tuesday said, up to 43 percent of the state's daily needs may have to come from this highly volatile market, in which power is bought within a day of need. That could could prove hugely expensive, because some spot market energy has cost five to six times what it would under the long-term contracts. It's widely expected that consumers ultimately would have to pay that tab, which could amount to billions of dollars. And because that power won't be locked up in contracts, there is no guarantee it will be available when it's needed, which could lead to blackouts, according to a recent report to the California Independent System Operator, which oversees three-fourths of the state's power grid. ``The situation in California could reach catastrophic proportions,'' the report concluded, adding that unless things change dramatically, ``it is a virtual certainty that peak demand will go unmet during many hot summer days.'' Steven Maviglio, Davis' press secretary, conceded Tuesday that the spot market could be troublesome. ``It's a major concern,'' he said, which is why the state is trying to line up more power contracts, speed up power plant construction and promote conservation. During the normally hot month of August, peak daily demand for power in the Independent System Operator's territory is expected to hit about 47,700 megawatts -- enough for nearly 48 million homes. The state's three main utility firms generate about 8,200 megawatts and have long-term contracts from wind, solar and other energy sources for about 11,700 megawatts more. That totals about 20,000 megawatts. Add in the 7,000 megawatts of long-term power that Davis has announced for this summer, and the state is still nearly 21,000 megawatts short. Costly proposition If all that power has to be obtained on the spot market, the price could be high. On Friday, last-minute purchases on the market averaged $411 per megawatt-hour, compared to about $150 per megawatt-hour for all power obtained by the Independent System Operator and $69 per megawatt-hour on average under Davis' long-term contracts. It's possible that not all 21,000 megawatts would have to be purchased on the market. Assuming Davis is successful in getting people to save 10 percent -- which could prove difficult -- conservation could reduce peak demand by nearly 5,000 megawatts. California also might be able to trade for another 5,000 megawatts with the federal government's Bonneville Power Administration and a hydroelectric operator in British Columbia, said Arthur O'Donnell, editor of California Energy Markets, a trade publication. Under such deals, those two outfits often send that much power to California when they don't need it and California returns the same amount or more when its demand is low. But O'Donnell said it wasn't clear whether 5,000 megawatts would be available this summer, because ``they still haven't gotten the snowpack they need in the Pacific Northwest,'' which could limit that region's generating capacity. Still falling short Even if those hydropower imports are available and conservation works as Davis hopes, it's likely California would still require the spot market for 11,000 megawatts to meet the August demand. That's more than 20 percent of the state's overall power needs. ``All of the surrounding states are buying probably less than 5 percent, at most, of their energy on the spot market,'' said Frank Wolak, a Stanford economist, who monitors electricity prices for the Independent System Operator. He worries about how much that power could cost and is disturbed that state officials haven't adequately addressed the issue. ``No one has any idea what they are going to do, and that is part of the problem,'' he said. Officials at Pacific Gas & Electric Co. are particularly concerned. They fear that their company -- which is nearing bankruptcy -- could get stuck for much of the spot market purchases by the Independent System Operator, which has threatened to bill the utilities for the cost. Fearing the annual bill for that power could hit $2.4 billion this year, PG&E wants the tab sent to the Department of Water Resources, which also is buying power on the spot market for the state. But the Department of Water Resources has objected to that idea and the matter is expected to be heard today by the California Public Utilities Commission. ``We're looking for clarity on a number of issues'' regarding how the spot market will work ``and certainly that's one of them,'' said Thomas Hannigan, the water agency's director. ``I don't think anybody knows the answer of who's going to pay for it,'' added PG&E spokesman John Nelson. But Nettie Hoge, executive director of the Utility Reform Network in San Francisco, said she suspects consumers ultimately will foot the bill. The unfortunate likelihood about spot market purchases is that ``ratepayers are responsible for all of it eventually,'' Hoge said. ``It's a very big problem.'' ---- Power Plant Plans Cause Conflicts East county residents blast supervisors Jason B. Johnson, Chronicle Staff Writer Wednesday, March 7, 2001 Industry dreams of building new power plants in east Contra Costa's hills are prompting an angry reaction among residents and elected officials who say they don't want more plants. The conflict was sparked by a vote by county supervisors yesterday to aggressively explore possible sites for new power plants throughout the county. The measure by Supervisors Mark DeSaulnier and Federal Glover, which passed on a 4-to-0 vote, directs the county administrator and Department of Community Development to compile a report on possible sites within 45 days. Supervisor Donna Gerber abstained after criticizing the plan for potentially repeating the same mistakes that plagued the state's energy deregulation effort by not considering how much energy the state, region and county will need in future years, and how much power is slated to come online. Gerber said alternative power sources, such as solar, should also be examined. A site drawing much attention is on top of a deposit of natural gas near the Concord Naval Weapons Station off Highway 4. The owners of 70 acres of land near the station recently formed a company, Golden State Power Co., to pursue construction of at least one small peaker plant and a much larger facility capable of producing 600 megawatts. The site could hold up to three small 50-megawatt peaker plants, and a larger 15-acre natural gas plant, said Steve Thomas, managing partner with Golden State. No land use applications have been filed. Thomas said 30 acres could be kept as open space to form a buffer around the project. ""Both (facilities) are state of the art,"" said Thomas. ""We believe that the site is ideal."" But east county residents at yesterday's meeting blasted the supervisorial measure and the power plant proposal, complaining that more plants could put people's health at risk. The region already is home to six power plants. ""We're going to get a good dose of poor air quality and (negative) health conditions from this,"" said Concord resident Evelyn Frietas. ""I think we need to stop and think about what we're doing to our quality of life."" Dan Torres said the home he bought in 1995 at a new Bay Point development would be alarmingly close to the proposed Golden State site. ""It will be dragging emissions over our home,"" said Torres. ""I didn't buy a home on that hill to be surrounded by power plants."" There are six power plants in operation in east Contra Costa. Pittsburg already has two power plants, and two more under construction. City Council members Frank Aiello and Yvonne Beals said the Antioch-Pittsburg area has done more than its share of energy production. Aiello said Pittsburg will soon produce enough energy to power three million homes in California. ""When is enough, enough?"" asked Aiello. ""Pittsburg has shouldered responsibility for a land-fill and two more power plants. At some point you have to say enough."" Beals said that while power plants have added millions to the city's general fund, the negatives of additional plants could outweigh the benefits. ""I don't think that Pittsburg or east county should be the dumping ground for energy for California,"" said Beals. ---- Supervisors set search for power plant sites The board also heard from the potential developers of a 650-megawatt plant between Bay Point and Concord By Thomas Peele TIMES STAFF WRITER MARTINEZ -- Contra Costa County supervisors took tentative steps Tuesday toward allowing the construction of at least one small power plant before summer, ordering that its staff identify potential sites in unincorporated areas within seven weeks. The board voted 4-0 to search for locations. Third District Supervisor Donna Gerber abstained, saying her colleagues lacked a ""comprehensive context'' to identify sites. ""I think the board knows just enough to be dangerous,'' she said. Gerber said the county should examine the potential for additional power plants within its borders but not investigate individual sites yet. But Fourth District Supervisor Mark DeSaulnier said the action was necessary because of the energy crisis and because of Gov. Gray Davis' call for local governments to help speed the construction of so-called ""peaker plants"" before July and August. ""I wouldn't do this except under an emergency,"" DeSaulnier said after the vote. ""There are unusual circumstances. We're not talking about putting this in a residential area."" Fifth District Supervisor Federal Glover backed DeSaulnier, but said he hoped for a location outside his heavily industrialized East County district. ""There's a lot of concern in East County as to the number of plants,"" he said. DeSaulnier said, though, that the only logical place for a small plant remains the ""industrial belt'' stretching along the waterfront from West County to Antioch. He declined to provide specifics, but said the only other potential site outside the industrial areas was the Concord Naval Weapons Station property. But he quickly added that he believes the U.S. Department of Defense ""would never go for it."" Also, DeSaulnier said he could not rule out the county building the plant itself and entering the electricity-selling market during peak demand times. Board Chairwoman Gayle Uilkema called that idea extremely premature and unlikely. ""That's a very powerful decision. I do not think we are ready,'' she said. The California Energy Commission listed the Equilon refinery in Martinez as one of 32 potential ""peaker plant"" sites in the state last week. Peaker plants kick in during peak usage times. Davis called for their quick construction before the height of summer and its energy demand for air conditioning. Plants that generate as much as 50,000 megawatts don't need Energy Commission approval. DeSaulnier said he believed a peaker plant could be built about a month after final approval. Supervisors also heard from the potential developers of a 650-megawatt plant between Bay Point and Concord. Walnut Creek commercial real estate developer Steve Thomas announced his intentions for the site north of Highway 4 last week. Construction could take two years. Eric Hasseltine, a consultant representing Thomas and what he described as a ""brand new"" company for the site, the Golden State Power Co., told supervisors that if they intended to speed peaker plant construction they should do what they can to expedite the larger plant. The Thomas site could house a peaker plant until the proposed larger one goes online. A large natural gas line passes under the site. DeSaulnier seemed cautious about the larger proposal, which he had described last week as ""a good site."" Uilkema, too, said she knew too little about it to comment. A resident who lives near the Thomas property asked the board to ""build it (the larger plant) closer to where you have industrial areas. You have to carefully consider the people"" who live nearby, said Dan Torres, 39. Evelyn Freitas of Concord said she lives downwind of the proposed site. ""Our air quality is going to be worse then it is now,"" she said. Gerber played on the environmental issues, saying the county already ranks second statewide to Los Angeles in volume of hazardous materials and amount of electrical generation. ---- Peter Schrag: California's $90 billion infrastructure gap (Published March 7, 2001) By now, California's surreal energy mess has grown from a crisis to a condition. It may not be quite as permanent as, say, death and taxes, but it's still something that could get a whole lot worse before it gets better. Until there's more realistic pricing, no gubernatorial pea-under-the-shell buyout scheme will solve it. Beyond the energy crisis, however, and in many ways similar to it, California faces a whole range of other infrastructure problems -- in transportation, in water resources and sewer systems, in school and university buildings -- that seem, once again, to be all but forgotten. The Business Roundtable has estimated the need at roughly $90 billion, though no number can possibly be exact. What's certain is that after a burst of high-level investment in public facilities during the 1950s and 1960s, California's annual capital investment has sunk precipitously -- from an annual $150 per capita in the 1960s, according to a set of recent studies for PPIC, the Public Policy Institute of California, to about $30 in the 1990s. But you probably don't need to tell anyone driving Bay Area or Los Angeles freeways or looking at the ubiquitous portable classrooms, those dreary brown boxes that house a fourth of our public school students. Ever since passage of Proposition 13 in 1978, we have been flying the flag of deferred maintenance. As in the state's electricity crisis, however, there's no way California can effectively address those problems merely by building or bonding itself out of them. In highway construction, in developing water resources, in finding enough university space to accommodate the Tidal Wave II of students, managing demand is likely to be as crucial to any solution as new construction. In the energy market -- and in electricity particularly -- it's been a familiar principle ever since David Roe of the Environmental Defense Fund first persuaded Pacific Gas and Electric that a dollar invested in conservation may be worth as much as the same investment in new generation. But in most other sectors of California's infrastructure, state and local, it's a lesson still to be learned. There have been scattered attempts to encourage conservation and reduce demand -- significant reduction in water use, for example, through the installation of low-flow faucets and low-flush toilets; some reduction in traffic by using rush-hour diamond lanes or by adjusting highway or (as in New York) bridge tolls to levels of congestion. But as pointed out by David Dowall, an urban economist at Berkeley, state policy-makers have not really begun to ""consider how demand management strategies can be applied to infrastructure service areas,"" or how the more efficient use of facilities and more realistic pricing -- highway tolls, say, or parking fees -- ""can reduce demand for scarce infrastructure resources."" In any case, says Dowall in one of the PPIC reports, we should pick which major projects we will build not just according to per capita estimates of how much we need, but according to how much consumers are willing to pay for them. To avoid hurting the poor, congestion-related highway tolls and other tariffs can be rebated on the basis of income. University fees can be means-tested. In California, they also could be adjusted to encourage summer school classes and other off-peak uses, rather than (as in the past) making UC summer courses more expensive. Given the political and economic uncertainties, there's no way to know how far such demand management can be taken. But there's not much doubt that, as Dowall and others point out, the state's infrastructure planning is a jumble of uncoordinated agency agendas and wish lists. The Legislature last year passed a bill, AB 1473, by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, that requires the governor, beginning next year, to submit an annual five-year infrastructure plan for state agencies and public schools, along with recommendations on how to fund it. In addition, Gov. Gray Davis' infrastructure commission is expected to recommend better coordination of infrastructure and land-use planning when it issues its report this spring. That would be a start. As California State Treasurer Phil Angelides has pointed out, the state desperately needs to start joint planning -- regional planning -- for housing, roads and other resources to reduce the need for long commutes; to preserve open space; and to bring jobs to where people live and housing to where the jobs are. That would itself reduce demand for more freeway lanes and, equally important, improve the quality of life. At present, most planning for housing, roads, water systems and other facilities rarely recognizes the regional impact of local decisions. In the East Bay, slow-growth forces push well-intended initiatives that would force more development into Tracy or Modesto and further tax the transportation systems to Silicon Valley. In city after city, there are beggar-thy-neighbor efforts to grab yet another shopping mall that produces a little extra sales tax revenue for the city that gets it, and that often compounds traffic and revenue problems in adjacent communities. In higher education we divide bond proceeds evenly among UC, the California State University and the community colleges even though the community colleges serve eight times as many students as UC. We plan road projects according to county, not regional, priorities. It is all done according to antiquated political and fiscal formulas that often no longer make sense. We don't just need better capital planning; we need a whole new planning system. ---- PG&E power plan debated at hearing A PUC meeting on the utility's capacity expansion project for the Tri-Valley follows weeks of protest from officials, residents Power upgrade in valley debated By Megan Long TIMES STAFF WRITER SAN FRANCISCO -- Dublin officials and the developer of a Livermore subdivision faced questions Tuesday about their opposition to alternative routes of PG&E's controversial Tri-Valley power upgrade plan -- and answered by restating their long-standing objections. Tuesday's cross-examination came during the third and likely final week of the California Public Utility Commission's evidentiary hearings on the utility's $91 million Tri-Valley 2002 Capacity Increase Project. It has followed weeks of protests of PG&E's upgrade plans by officials and residents of Livermore, Pleasanton, Dublin and San Ramon. And before the questioning started, Dublin Vice Mayor Janet Lockhart reiterated concerns about an alternative route deemed ""environmentally superior"" that would place a substation just 1,000 feet north of Interstate 580 between Tassajara and Fallon roads. She said that would undermine the results of a 15-year process to plan the eastern development of the city. ""It's extremely important to the residents of our community to follow a plan we worked hard to produce,"" she said. Dublin officials favor PG&E's proposed placement of the station three miles north of the freeway, away from new high-tech company offices and housing developments. Besides the Dublin substation, the project calls for construction of a substation in North Livermore, expansion of the Pleasanton substation and installation of 23.5 miles of new lines. In response to questions from PUC Administrative Law Judge Michelle Cooke, Dublin's public works director, Lee Thompson, confirmed that the Lin family, the owner of the property where the alternative substation would go, wasn't interested in selling the land to PG&E. Cooke also asked Thompson to define a ""discretionary permit,"" which is how city officials said they might treat a permit for a substation. Lee said that type of permit is one the city has the right to approve or not depending on the project's impact. Eddie Peabody, Dublin's community development director, testified that the zoning for the Lin property accommodates uses such as commercial business, research and development and light manufacturing. It would not, he said, be appropriate for a power substation. He said parcels within the East Dublin area that could host a station would include those zoned for public and semi-public uses, including land recently bought by Oracle and Sun Microsystems for new campuses. While Dublin officials testified that one buyer of land in that area paid $86 per square foot, others suggested land prices would be inflated to help make a PG&E land buy look prohibitively expensive. An executive of Centex Homes, the developer of new houses near Isabel Avenue and Concannon Boulevard, objected to an alternative route that would place high-voltage transmission lines overhead along Isabel and Stanley Boulevard. David Barclay, president of Centex's Northern California division, said that the 80-foot to 150-foot towers would have a severe visual impact on residents of the Prima tract. Ed O'Neill, a lawyer for the Kottinger Ranch Homeowners Association, pointed out that existing distribution lines on 50-foot poles on Isabel already mar the view for residents. The Foley family has been ranching on land south of Pleasanton city limits for years, said their attorney Kennedy Richardson. The utility's project would place overhead lines and a transmission station on rolling hills that the family envisions as one day being public open space with limited development, Richardson said. Lawyers for Pleasanton, Livermore, Kottinger Ranch and Centex are scheduled to cross-examine a PG&E engineer today about the project's routing. That testimony should be the most controversial of the hearings. Judge Cooke is expected to recommend an alignment by July to the PUC, which will make the final decision. ---- NEWS State OKs 'Peaker' Power Plant at SFO / Temporary generator could be sending electricity to 50,000 homes by August Marshall Wilson 03/08/2001 The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL Page A.20 (Copyright 2001) State energy officials yesterday approved plans to build a temporary electrical plant at San Francisco International Airport that should generate enough juice to power 50,000 homes by August. Meeting in Sacramento, the Energy Commission voted 4-0 to give the green light to the gas-fired plant. It will operate during peak summer and winter demand to help the state avoid Stage 3 power alerts and rolling blackouts. Texas-based El Paso Merchant Energy Co. won approval under a new state law mandating speedy, four-month reviews of so-called ""peaker"" plants. It was the only one of seven applications statewide to win approval. The other proposals were withdrawn for various reasons. The 51-megawatt plant, formally called the United Golden Gate Power Project, is scheduled to be built at the northwest corner of the airport near the United Airlines maintenance center. Within the next few weeks El Paso plans to apply to build a 571- megawatt, $400 million plant in the same area, company spokesman Jesse Frederick said. It would undergo a separate review by state energy officials. The small ""peaker"" plant approved yesterday is to generate electricity beginning around Aug. 1 for up to three years. After the end of three years, the plant would be closed or converted to a cleaner-burning system. Under state law, a temporary ""peaker"" plant is permitted to spew more air pollution than a permanent plant. El Paso's temporary plant is to be built next to a co-generation plant operated by United Airlines. It would use existing connections for natural gas and water supplies and tap into existing power transmission lines. Electricity generated by the plant would be pumped into the state's electrical grid, Energy Commission spokesman Gary Fay said. It would also serve as a backup for San Francisco Airport in case of a blackout. No one spoke against the proposed plant at yesterday's commission meeting. The proposal, however, has been criticized by area residents and environmentalists worried about air pollution. Scott Buschman, a professional photographer and San Bruno resident, said yesterday it was unjust that state officials 100 miles away in Sacramento approved a Texas company's proposal to put a power plant on land owned by San Francisco. ""The fact that they approved it without considering the public's concerns, foremost air quality, is very disturbing,"" he said. Fay said the plant complies with clean-air standards. Answering the criticism about the location of yesterday's deliberation, he said three hearings and several workshops were held in communities near the airport.

Davis's Plan To Power California --- State's Outlays for Electricity May Be Hard to Recover Without Rate Increases --- Betting on Long-Term Deals By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Rebecca Smith, Mitchel Benson and John R. Emshwiller 03/08/2001 The Wall Street Journal A1 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Earlier this year, Gov. Gray Davis made what may be the biggest bet in the history of the nation's biggest state: that he could tame an out-of-control electricity market and avoid devastating blackouts without busting the state's budget, antagonizing its consumers or derailing his own political career. His wager is still on the table, but the assumptions that underlie it are looking increasingly shaky these days. The governor has already spent around $2 billion of public money buying hugely expensive wholesale power, taking over the role formerly played by the state's near-bankrupt electric utilities. And California will probably be obliged to spend billions more before its electricity market stabilizes and those utilities are restored to some semblance of financial health. Under the governor's plan, California aims to recoup the money it is using to buy electricity by issuing $10 billion in bonds. That way it would still have a healthy budget surplus to finance new spending on roads, schools and other public services. But there's a potentially big obstacle to this plan. The state Legislature, worried about racking up billions in new debt, has put limits on the size of any bond offering. In broad terms, the Legislature's action would allow the state to borrow only four times as much as it can recover annually from utility customers. Right now that doesn't appear to be much. Under the current rate structure, essentially set in place by California's flawed 1996 electricity-deregulation plan, consumers pay far less for power than the cost of acquiring it on the wholesale market. Preliminary estimates submitted by utilities last month to the California Public Utilities Commission show the state's share of the proceeds from electricity sales this year could be as little as $241 million -- not enough to support even $1 billion in bond sales under the Legislature's formula. That would leave the state on the hook for much of the money it has already paid for power -- not to mention the billions more Gov. Davis will need to spend. That, in turn, raises the prospect that California's economy and its credit rating both could deteriorate significantly. But state finance officials say that, based on their own projections, they will be able to extract enough money to support a $10 billion bond issue. Walking a careful line between fiscal prudence and political survival, Mr. Davis and others in his administration are scrambling to come up with ways to get around the legislative restrictions without raising rates for consumers. ""If I wanted to raise rates, I could solve this problem in 20 minutes,"" Mr. Davis says. The governor says he believes that the state can obtain enough affordable power through long-term power-supply contracts to avoid the need for a big rate increase. The billions of dollars the state hopes to borrow would be used to help pay for power until electricity prices drop, as they are expected to do when new power plants come online over the next few years. The Davis administration fears that what may be its only other option -- a big increase in retail electric rates -- could prompt angry consumer groups to seek new electricity laws through a statewide ballot initiative during next year's election. That's when Mr. Davis is expected to run for a second term as governor. But trying to save California without rate increases is forcing Mr. Davis to make some colossal gambles with the state's money. State officials estimate that in the next several months, California will need to spend as much as $6 billion on power purchases -- equivalent to the state's entire fiscal surplus. Mr. Davis is also looking to spend several billion more to buy the transmission assets of three investor-owned utilities in order to restore two of them to credit-worthiness. He also has announced plans to spend several hundred million dollars more on conservation programs designed to reduce demand while new power plants are being built in the state. In order to limit the state's financial exposure in the meantime, the governor and his aides have, in some cases, ignored state law. They have threatened appointed officials who have stood in the way. And they have sharply restricted the flow of information to the public. None of those steps is expected to do much to reduce state spending on power in the coming months. In a few weeks, power usage is expected to begin a sharp seasonal rise as Californians switch on their air conditioners with the coming of warmer weather. By various estimates, demand during peak periods this summer could outstrip supply by 10%, or several thousand megawatts. That could produce more rolling blackouts like the ones that hit Northern California earlier this year. It is also likely to put strong upward pressure on wholesale electricity prices. Steven Zimmerman, managing director of Standard & Poor's Corp., says Mr. Davis and his aides don't ""have a lot of time"" to put a cap on the state's financial exposure to the crisis. The credit-rating agency has put the state on credit watch for a possible downgrade, which would affect the value of all of California's outstanding public debt. Moody's Investor Service Inc. is also concerned. It said in a recent report that the power crisis could soon ""seriously threaten the health"" of the state's economy. Mr. Davis, a Democrat and career politician, was dealt a bad hand when he took office in 1999. The deregulation plan that sparked the state's electricity crisis was enacted under his predecessor, Republican Pete Wilson. But Mr. Davis was slow to react to early signs of trouble this past summer and alarms sounded by members of the state Legislature. By the time Mr. Davis finally sprang into action earlier this year, a troublesome power-supply squeeze had escalated into a crisis. In a Jan. 17 declaration of emergency, the governor designated the state Department of Water Resources to take the utilities' place as the daily buyer of huge quantities of electricity. His hope: that by making the state the dominant player in California's power sector, he would ease electricity producers' concerns about getting paid and give the state enough clout to negotiate lower long-term power prices. Earlier this week, Mr. Davis announced final or tentative agreements with 20 power suppliers to furnish the state with a total of 8,900 megawatts for periods of as long as 20 years. But the supply situation remains extremely uncertain for this summer, when demand probably will top 45,000 megawatts. If the state can secure enough power under contract and push down demand through aggressive conservation, it might be able to squeak through the summer season. If not, it will be forced to keep buying huge amounts of costly power in the cash market. Under deregulation, retail electric rates were frozen for several years, while wholesale-power costs were free to fluctuate. When the plan was conceived, wholesale prices were low and expected to go lower. However, a combination of unexpected growth in power demand and a lack of new generating capacity helped produce a supply squeeze. Average wholesale prices more than tripled last year from 1999. And in January those prices were up 10-fold from a year earlier. By then, California's two biggest investor-owned utilities -- the Pacific Gas & Electric unit of PG&E Corp. and the Southern California Edison subsidiary of Edison International -- faced imminent financial collapse. They had racked up billions of dollars in wholesale power bills they couldn't afford to pay. As generators began shying away from selling to the two utilities, the Clinton administration forced them to sell power into the California market, an order left in place during the first weeks of the Bush administration. Still, northern California was hit by rolling blackouts on several days in early January. Since then, the DWR, which does some electricity trading as an adjunct to its main mission of managing the state's giant system of aqueducts and reservoirs, has had to learn the ins and outs of power markets on the run. It hasn't been easy. David Mills, trading-floor manager for the federal Bonneville Power Administration, says the water agency has at times offered to pay $50 to $100 per megawatt hour more than the available market price. ""They agree to prices that make you wonder,"" says Mr. Mills, whose organization markets electricity from federal dams in the Pacific Northwest. ""You'd at least think they'd check to see what the prevailing price is before throwing out their offer."" Mr. Mills says that ""to cut California some slack,"" he occasionally has instructed his traders to sell at prices lower than the DWR had offered to pay. Ray Hart, the water agency deputy director responsible for the power purchasing, says he isn't aware of any cases in which the DWR has overpaid. He says his team has been ""extremely successful by all measures."" Ultimately, the DWR's trading acumen is far less important than the overall arithmetic of power supply and demand in California. With the price of natural gas that feeds many of the region's generating plants at near record levels and some suppliers reluctant to sell into the troubled California market, wholesale electric prices remain stubbornly high and, in recent days, have again been rising. The Legislature has advanced the DWR about $3 billion from the state's general fund for power purchases. Under emergency legislation passed by the Legislature and signed by Mr. Davis on Feb. 1, the general fund is to be reimbursed from a planned bond sale later this year. But under terms of the emergency law, the water agency would have to wrest $2.5 billion a year in revenue from retail electricity rates in order to sell the $10 billion worth of bonds sought by Mr. Davis. Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, a Southern California Democrat, says the formula was created to ensure that there would be a way to repay the bonds without draining the state's coffers. ""We didn't want to just open our wallets,"" he says. According to the language of the Feb. 1 law, the water agency gets what's left of revenue collected from ratepayers after the utilities pay certain of their own power-supply bills and other expenses. And, in their filings with the PUC last month, the utilities reckoned, under their worst-case scenarios, that there would be only $241 million available to the DWR this year. State officials are quietly pushing the PUC to rejigger the formula so that the water department gets more money -- even though that would clash with terms of the Feb. 1 law. Robert Miyashiro, deputy director of the Department of Finance, says the emergency law was ""drafted poorly"" and has led people to believe the DWR ""only gets the leftover money."" He predicts there will be ""cleanup legislation."" At the request of the Davis administration, the PUC is considering a plan to use a different revenue-sharing formula than the one in the state law. The proposed new formula was written ""in close consultation"" with Mr. Davis's Finance Department, says PUC President Loretta Lynch, who supports the initiative and is hoping to rush it through. The effort has drawn some opposition. Commissioner Richard Bilas at a recent PUC meeting questioned the legality of the commission attempting to change a formula set by the Legislature. PG&E is even more emphatic, since the DWR's extra money could come at the utility's expense. The formula ""threatens to undo the very financial protections for the utilities that [the new law] attempted to provide,"" the utility said in a recent filing with the PUC. As politicians and regulators wrestle with that issue, the Davis administration has taken a step to reduce the outflow of state cash that also seems to conflict with the Feb. 1 law. It was widely assumed that the law required the DWR to buy any electricity the state needed to keep its lights on. However, on many occasions, the DWR has refused to buy power on the grounds that it was too expensive, citing a portion of the new law that urges the agency to hold down costs. The task of covering any remaining shortfall has passed to the California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's energy grid and is charged with buying power when necessary to avert shortages. However, the ISO doesn't have any power-purchasing money of its own, and the major parties it would normally bill are PG&E and Edison, whose inability to pay their power bills was the reason the state started buying electricity in the first place. Amid criticism of its stance from generators, utilities and Wall Street, the DWR says it has started covering more of the utilities' electricity costs. The water agency is now buying 95% to 99% of what California needs in a given day, says the agency's Mr. Hart. But increased buying only adds to the uncertainty about the eventual tab. The state's legislative analyst, Elizabeth Hill, recently recommended that lawmakers hold off considering more than $2 billion in state spending on items ranging from college construction to beach cleanups because of continuing questions about the financial impact of the electricity crisis. Like others, Ms. Hill complains that the governor's office and state agencies haven't been forthcoming with information. Indeed, the DWR refuses to say precisely how much power it is purchasing and at what prices, though it has on several occasions gone back to the Legislature for more money. State officials say that data on its purchasing activities would give suppliers an advantage in continuing electricity-supply contract talks. State Controller Kathleen Connell, who is running for mayor of Los Angeles in an April election, recently announced plans to post state power-spending information on her department's Web site. But within 24 hours, Ms. Connell suspended that plan after discussions with senior Davis administration officials. ""I feel very strongly that this information should be publicly released,"" says Ms. Connell. ""I just don't want to do anything that would weaken the state's effectiveness in negotiating."" In an effort to more tightly control events, the governor obtained legislative approval to abolish the 26-member ISO board, which was made up of everyone from utility executives to representatives of consumer groups. He then appointed a new five-member board. To ensure a quick transition, the California attorney general threatened the old board members with fines of as much as $5,000 each if they didn't immediately relinquish their positions. All did. ""I was offended"" at the ""heavy-handed"" treatment, says Karen Johanson, a former ISO board member. One of the first acts of the ISO's new board was to close a meeting about the electricity crisis. The former ISO board routinely held such meetings in public. ISO attorneys say the meeting was largely designed as a private briefing for new board members and that the organization is committed to keeping its deliberations as open as possible. The Wall Street Journal and other news organizations have unsuccessfully challenged the closure in Sacramento state court. Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Subject:: Re: Daily Update/ Legislative activity - 08/24/00
Body:: I attended Cmmr. Wood's two-day hearing on Wholesale Markets, which concluded today (8/24) in San Diego. Three Commissioner's were present (Wood, Lynch and Neeper) with Duque and Bilas participating by phone. Administrative Law Judge Wetzel was present and a transcript was taken. The quasi-legislative hearing was the beginning of a record developed for the investigation into the workings of wholesale/retail markets. This session focused on Wholesale markets. There will be subsequent sessions on retail issues, market structure and other related issues in the future. My conclusion from this session is that Wood is looking for support for increasing regulatory intervention in the market. Dan Larcamp, Director of the Office of markets, Tariffs and Rates, FERC, was present. He relayed FERC's concern of this matter and a desire to hold hearings in San Diego. He also relayed that Hoecker held a press conference announcing the opening of a 206 investigative proceeding into the operation of the wholesale markets in California, which carried with it refund authority. The format of the hearing was to respond to pre-filed questions developed by Wood/Lynch. Each member of the panel would respond to the questions and any questions posed by the Commissioners, the Judge or the CPUC Attorney. No questions were posed by members of the audience. Yesterday's panel of academics were comprised of: 1. Dr. Timothy Duane-UC Berkley 2. Dr. William Hogan-Harvard 3. Dr. Frank Wolak-Stanford (ISO Market Surveillance Committee) 4. David Marcus-Energy Consultant for the Coaltion of Utility Employees 5. Dr. Gene Coyle 6. Dr. Jean-Michel Glachant, Universite Paris I Pantheon Sorbonne The panel was asked to speak as individuals and not on behalf of any institutions they may represent. While the purpose of the panel seemed to be to determine that market power was being exercised and that prices were too high and therefore not just and reasonable, the panelist stopped short of blaming generators and market participants in behaving illegally. The concensus generally was that market power did exist at various times, but the mere existence did not constitute bad behavior. None, with the exception of Dr. Wolak who is in the process of doing a study using recent data as part of his role for the Market Surveillance Committee, had done a study. There was some discussion, though not much, of the monopsony power of the utilities. I think ultimately the group conceded that scarcity of supply amplified concerns about the exercise of market power, as even the increase in gas costs did not fully explain the recent spikes. Wolak believes that encourage utilities to enter into forward purchases will reduce the exercise of real-time market power. Hogan seemed to be there with Sempra's interests in mind. He continued to promote expansion of the ISO's abilities to dispatch load as well as maintain system reliability. There was alot of discussion about forward purchase ability for utilities so as to be less subject to volatile market prices. The concerns were also discussed about the appropriateness of a distribution utility making purchasing decisions on behalf of its customers. This included discussion of separation of these functions and the default provider role. Most everyone agreed that rolling back to a regulated market was not feasible without raising other major and serious concerns, however there seemed to be support for some interim measures where cost-of-service regulation may be a good idea and that was during peak periods. All agreed that a demand response, and price signals, are important in the long-run, although not to the extent currently experienced in San Diego. Today's panel included representatives from SDG&E, SCE and PG&E, TURN, UCAN and ORA. While yesterday's panel maintained objectivity as to whether or not generators were exercising market power to the detriment of the system, today's panel made no bones about the generators being to blame. SCE/PG&E indicated their need for relief for recovery of market costs in excess of the rate freeze. SDG&E was still on the hot seat for their inaction in hedging any of their supply. SDG&E brought up their failed PBR proposal and ORA and UCAN thought that that may be one way to incent the utility to be more responsible with their purchases. UCAN discussed the Governor's direction and the potential for putting rate caps into affect for residential and small commercial. He mentioned that C&I customers are experience difficulties as well. TURN raised the need for cost-based bid caps and cost-based peaking contracts. Mike Florio, TURN, urged against any further divestitute of assets and alleged market concentration on those assets that had been divested. In fact, TURN urged the Commission to seek legislation to clarify the Commission's authority to order retention of assets. Neeper urged that part of the solution should be changing the current requirement to use the PX as the only authorized exchange, although TURN disagreed.

Good new - The Williamson Act passed the Senate 34-1, It should be heard at the assembly Saturday or Monday if it is not redirected to a Committee hearing. 2. There was a long meeting with Ducheny with regards to AB 970. The enviro's boycotted, they want to draft a bill with Keeley. Labor was obstructionist - they wanted to gut all the expediting siting language with regards to all facilities except for the peaking plants. Rate Cap related bills 1. The Edison Language on Rate Stabilization may not go anywhere. Edison has not found an author because of the efforts of Enron and others lobbying against it. Furthermore there are signs that Gov. Davis opposes it. 2. The Governor's office has issued a proposed language for a rate cap bill. The language however is not available as of yet. It may be released today or tomorrow. SDG&E has shown concerns over the content of the bill. They seem to think that it is worse than initially proposed by the Governor in his press release. The bill includes retroactive rate caps through 6/1/00. The rate cap could reflect Wood's rate cap proposal (6.5 cts cap on the energy component The bill does not specify who or how the costs associated with the cap will be recovered. (The reasoning is that UDCs will be more cautious in their procurement if there is uncertainty on who is responsible for the costs.) All of this is speculative. We hope to see the actual language soon. 3. Enron has been working with the Republican leadership to promote a rate cap proposal similar to the amended language we have proposed for AB2290. The bill focuses only on SDG&E customers and our major principals are the following. The Interim Rate Cap should be limited to residential and small commercial customers, plus specific institutions that have a significant public role, such as schools and hospitals. The Interim Rate Cap should be limited to the period ending December 31, 2001. The Interim Rate Cap must be structured so that any undercollection is eventually recovered from the same customers who benefit from the lower rates provided by the rate cap.

Subject:: CONFIDENTIAL - Residential in CA
Body:: In the meeting today, no decision was made about what to do with Enron's 16,000 residential customers. Each of the contracts gives a basic 30 day out right to Enron. That being said, I think that we have a short window to push for DA before any public action impacts us in Sacramento. I realize that the ultimate action (which I think is inevitable) makes it harder for our advocacy on DA, but real $ are flowing out of the company. EES will give us notice when a decision is reached. Thanks, Jim

Questions the report raises for Enron: Is Enron part of the oil & natural gas sector or the banking and finance sector? Both are looking at information sharing mechanism to mitigate risks to IT systems. The Banking & Finance sector has been operating an information sharing and analysis center (ISAC) for over a year. Discussions with members of the banking and finance sector indicate it has value. If Enron is a part of the oil & natural gas sector, are we willing to take a leadership role and enter into a potential LLC with other Council member companies to form an ISAC for this sector? Cost to Enron would be based on number of individuals receiving alerts etc., however, it could be as low as $13K per year. An additional cost would be to appoint an employee to the LLC's governance body to ensure Enron's needs were addressed. Archie Dunham, CONOCO's Chairman, has agreed to champion this initiative if the Council recommends it at the 6 June meeting. Current coordination: The legal issues have been worked by a sub-group lead by Tom Carmel, CONOCO. Mark Holsworth, Corp. Legal has been our representative. Recent DOJ action regarding information sharing to mitigate IT risks seems to indicate that anti-trust will not be an issue. Steptoe & Johnson, LLP have undertaken a review of the liability issues and suggested ways to mitigate them. Mike Hicks and I have been working with Mark Thibodeaux, Corp. IT Compliance, and will be meeting with Steve Kean and others in the security and IT protection efforts in next two weeks. Recommendation: Enron participate fully in the oil and natural gas sector's efforts - As Enron becomes more and more dependant on IT, having a mechanism that provides tailored vulnerability information and solutions in a ""one-stop-shop"" format is valuable and can lead to reduced insurance premiums.

Just about everyone has an opinion about how to solve California's energy problems. From building more power plants to capping prices to doing away with deregulation, federal regulators, consumer advocates, economists and energy companies all have weighed in with plans for ending the electricity shortages and financial distress that have troubled the state over the past year. Here is a look at what some say California should do now: LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD For many, the solution to California's energy woes is to increase the supply of power in the state by building more power plants. A greater supply from more sources would bring wholesale prices down. And two California economists, Severin Borenstein at the University of California's Energy Institute in Berkeley and Peter Navarro at the University of California at Irvine, argue that the impact would be particularly pronounced in areas where electricity generators now have monopoly or near-monopoly power. ""We need to build more power plants in close proximity to the ones where companies have market power,"" says Mr. Borenstein. The problem, the economists say, is that some areas of the state have only one power plant, so the energy suppliers can manipulate the price by reducing output at a certain plant when demand is high in order to boost prices. California does get some power from generators in the Northwest and Canada. But because demand is so great in the state and throughout the entire region and supply is limited, what is brought in doesn't make much of a dent. The economists add that because suppliers, including Williams Co., Duke Energy, Mirant Corp. and Enron Corp., have this freedom to charge whatever the market will bear, they can take unfair advantage of consumers. For instance, in Carlsbad, a community in San Diego, only one power plant owned by Duke Energy provides electricity to utilities in that area. The company has no competition, so it has the ability to set the price for its power, according to state Sen. Joseph Dunn, a Democrat from Santa Ana who has set up a Senate committee to investigate manipulation in the wholesale power market. ""If you need electricity and there's only one place to buy it, and everyone wants it, you're going to pay through the nose,"" says Frank Wolak, an economics professor at Stanford University and the director of a power-market monitoring committee, which monitors the wholesale electricity market to identify anticompetitive behavior. ""Is this fair? No. Something must be done about it."" Duke Energy spokesman Tom Williams says the company denies that it has ever done this and rejects allegations that it has manipulated the price of electricity. Spokespeople for the other companies also deny such allegations, saying prices have surged because demand has outstripped supply. Partly to prevent possible abuse of market power by suppliers, the Independent System Operator, which runs California's grid, contracted with energy companies to have them operate some power plants as ""reliability must-run"" units. In return for a fixed annual payment from the state, the companies agreed to make these plants available at a moment's notice to balance supply and demand. Electricity from the plants was priced based on the price of natural gas and other variable operating costs. In 1999, the ISO canceled two-thirds of the RMR contracts because the units were rarely called upon, due to a steady supply of power in the state, and the expense of the contracts to the state. When power prices surged in 2000, however, the ISO didn't use the remaining contracts to help keep supply in balance and power costs down. An ISO spokesman says the agency doesn't ""have a reason to explain why the RMR contracts weren't utilized."" He declined to comment further. CAP PRICES While many, including Gov. Davis, see more power plants as a long-term solution to the state's energy woes, they advocate capping the prices of energy sold on the spot market as an interim solution to keep the market stable while the plants are being constructed. ""In the short term, we need price caps,"" Gov. Davis has said to state legislators. ""That means that [power generators] get all their costs back and a 40% or 50% profit, which in this economy is pretty darn good."" Robert Glynn, chief executive officer of PG&E Corp. unit Pacific Gas & Electric, which sold some of its generating plants during deregulation, adds that price caps will ""keep wholesale prices low while new power plants are built."" For more than a year, the governor had urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to place a temporary cap on electricity sold in the spot market, saying the move would save the state's consumers billions of dollars on their energy bills while new power plants are being built. In May, after many months of rejecting the idea, the agency imposed an initial cap on prices in California during emergencies. In June, it extended the cap to other Western states and established that it would remain in effect at all times. Wholesale electricity prices at first fell in response to the caps, but surged again during a spate of hot weather in early July. FERC has been forced to make a number of adjustments to the cap as a result. These price caps, however, will expire in September 2002. Gov. Davis believes the caps need to stay in effect longer -- for three years -- to allow for the construction of new plants. RESTORE CREDIT-WORTHINESS Rebuilding a financial base for utilities is key to putting California's power market back on track. One way to do this, some experts say, is to let the utilities sell bonds to help them pay off debts and recoup the billions of dollars they've lost buying power at prices they couldn't afford. This would then allow the utilities to get investment-grade ratings. ""All California has to do is to ensure the utilities are credit-worthy again"" via the bond sale, says John Bryson, president and chief executive officer of Edison International, the Rosemead, Calif., parent of Southern California Edison Co. So far, the California Assembly and Senate have proposed that Southern California Edison sell $2.9 billion in revenue bonds, backed by a surcharge tacked onto the bills of the state's largest businesses, to pay off its commercial paper holders and alternative-power producers, such as wind and solar generators. The utility has a contract with the alternative-power producers, and the price it pays for power is fixed. But the utility has defaulted on those payments. The state believes that Edison International needs to help rescue its struggling utility. A $400 million tax rebate that Edison International is expected to receive from the federal government also could be applied to help the utility out of its financial crisis. ""The state needs to provide some stability to Edison so we can get back in the power business again,"" says Mr. Bryson. ""It's a pretty straightforward solution."" While utilities still continue to deliver electricity to consumers, the state has had to step in to buy the power on their behalf. Energy companies are currently refusing to sell power to the utilities, fearing they won't get paid because the utilities have defaulted on prior payments and have no credit. California's 1996 deregulation law uncapped wholesale power prices, but froze the rate the utilities could charge consumers. When wholesale prices surged in both the spot and day-ahead markets, running well above what the utilities could charge customers, the utilities couldn't do anything about it because the state deregulation law didn't allow them to sign long-term supply contracts. Restoring the utilities' credit-worthiness, however, may not be as quick as Mr. Bryson makes it sound given the huge sums that Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric owe the energy companies that sold them electricity. Pacific Gas & Electric filed for bankruptcy-court protection in April and is trying to write a reorganization plan in just six months, pay off all of its creditors in full and return to the power business, says the company's Mr. Glynn. CONSERVE ENERGY A massive conservation effort ""that busts the energy cartel,"" by reducing demand and, thus, lowering the price of wholesale power, is the only way to save the state in the short term, says Harvey Rosenfield, who heads the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, a consumer-advocacy group in Santa Monica, Calif. ""Only if demand falls so greatly that members of the energy cartel are forced to break ranks and lower prices will conservation solve the short-term problem."" Gov. Davis says Californians already are conserving at a record rate. For example, in July Californians boosted conservation efforts during the day by 11%, compared with the same time last year. Conservation efforts have been suggested from the use of halogen light bulbs to running washing machines in the evening to setting the thermostat at 78 degrees. REREGULATE Nettie Hoge, executive director of the Utility Reform Network, a consumer-advocacy group based in San Francisco, believes the state should return to the days when utilities monopolized the power market. Back then, she says, power supplies were abundant and prices preset. ""It was working just fine back then,"" Ms. Hoge says. ""It's not until we opened this state up to so-called competition that everything started to go in the toilet. Look at us now: We're like a Third World country. We can barely keep the lights on."" She says regulation would let consumers know what the price of electricity is and that price would stay the same regardless of fluctuations in supply and demand. California wouldn't ""be held hostage by out-of-state energy companies that not only control the price of electricity but also control the supply,"" Ms. Hoge says. But some experts say that under federal law, it might be impossible for states to reclaim authority over power plants that fall under the jurisdiction of the federal government. And it would cost billions of dollars to construct new government-owned generators or buy back with public funds old utility plants. LEAVE MARKETS ALONE Others believe that California's electricity markets should be left alone to evolve and become more competitive. The state should resist putting in constraints, like price caps, a number of Wall Street firms have advised the state. Merrill Lynch & Co., Credit Suisse First Boston and Goldman Sachs & Co. are among companies that helped the state and its utilities try to come up with financial solutions earlier this year to help ease the energy problem. None of the plans were implemented, however. ""The state needs to get out of power business,"" says Richard Cortwright, an energy analyst at Standard & Poor's Corp. The goal of any new plan should be to eliminate what's left of regulation, says Susan Abbott, an executive director at Moody's Investor Service Inc. ""State regulators restricted the utilities from signing forward contracts [locking in power supply at a fixed price], they capped retail rates and never encouraged retail choice,"" says Ms. Abbott. ""That's the antithesis of a competitive market. Until the state understands competition, this energy crisis will just continue to fester for years to come."" --- Mr. Leopold is chief of the Los Angeles bureau for Dow Jones Newswires. Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Energy (A Special Report) What Now? --- Looking to Washington: What can the feds do to make deregulation a less bumpy process? By Vasugi V. Ganeshananthan 09/17/2001 The Wall Street Journal R13 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) WASHINGTON -- Before California's energy problems began, support was building for congressional action on national electricity deregulation. But this year, says Sen. Frank H. Murkowski, a longtime proponent, ""support for deregulation is not there, in my opinion."" Still, even without a comprehensive package, the federal government could take some crucial partial steps toward more-open power markets. Some in Congress have backed measures that would lead to ""restructuring,"" as opposed to deregulation. That could involve such steps as settling more authority on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ensure reliability and access to the transmission grid. Another target for Congress will be the remaining antiquated laws and regulations designed for the days of monopolies, when each utility had its own borders. The aim is to fix troubled wholesale markets to set the stage for states to elect to deregulate at the retail level. ""I think it would be in the industry's best interest for this Congress to deal with some of the issues that have been hanging out there for some time,"" says Rick Shapiro, managing director of local and governmental affairs at Enron Corp., the Houston-based energy giant. In Congress so far this year, several bills have been introduced. The energy bill the House passed in early August offered some modest measures to foster competition, such as tax breaks to utilities joining regional transmission organizations, or RTOs, which FERC has asked energy companies to create to operate the power grid. Rep. Joe Barton, a Texas Republican and chairman of the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee, plans to introduce even more restructuring legislation this fall. His bill may address reliability, transmission and incentives for building power plants, among other issues. And Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, has plans for a bill of his own: His main point is to enhance FERC's authority to address power-market problems like reliability and fair access to the grid. But among other issues, he is making the latest of several pushes over the past few years to repeal the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, which was designed to prevent large national companies from dominating the industry. Though Congress in 1992 passed the Energy Policy Act permitting competition among wholesale electricity suppliers, the 1935 law still limits certain investments by utility holding companies. And many say it impedes competition. Sen. Bingaman also wants to repeal the parts of 1978's Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act that mandate the use of renewable energy, though he has said he still supports promoting renewable energy. Of course, there are longstanding, thorny issues that make federal action on energy markets a tough sell. While some Democrats, like Mr. Bingaman, are interested in the topic, the party in general is less in favor of deregulation than are Republican lawmakers. Thus, the recent Democratic takeover of the Senate is widely considered a setback. And while some regions strongly favor change, others don't. For instance, many Western states -- including Washington, whose Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell is a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee -- are feeling the ill effects of deregulation in California and are thus leery. Naysayers point to what they say was FERC inaction regarding inadequate power supplies and controversial pricing auctions. ""From California's perspective, FERC failed miserably by doing nothing for month after month after month,"" says Rep. Henry Waxman, a Democrat from California. ""I fear we might make the same mistake at the national level that California made at the state level."" But deregulation advocates think nationwide deregulation is inevitable. ""Would you like to be in an airport where there is one airline from here to Atlanta? Or an airport where there are three airlines, including a low-cost option?"" says Marc Yacker, director of government and public affairs for the Electricity Consumers Resource Council, a Washington, D.C., group of large industrial electricity users. If regulated states ""see that residents in Pennsylvania and Texas have a well-functioning electricity system . . . they will change."" Here are some of the main issues currently being hashed out in Washington: -- WHOLESALE MARKETS: Before any serious discussion of consumer deregulation can take place, Mr. Bingaman thinks wholesale markets need to be fixed. Among his main points: clarification of FERC and state jurisdiction. A recent white paper from him outlining his planned legislation calls for Congress to clarify that FERC is the ultimate authority over all transmission issues, with the power to overrule states. The paper adds, ""Legislation should affirm FERC's authority to order utilities to join regional transmission organizations."" Such powers, the thinking goes, would allow FERC to ensure that power transmission is fair and that access is free of any favoritism among affiliated utilities. And that would go a long way toward fixing wholesale markets and paving the way for retail deregulation should individual states choose to participate. ""To leave electricity legislation for another day would be to ensure that the problems faced now in the West will be replicated across the country,"" he wrote in the paper. -- FEDERAL AUTHORITY: The extent to which a federal entity should have authority over power markets is a contentious issue. Mr. Bingaman desires far-reaching powers for FERC. And power suppliers favor having federal regulators hold sway over transmission issues. Eugene Peters of the Electric Power Supply Association, a Washington, D.C., trade group for competitive power producers, says FERC ""has a role here in that they can essentially create a national template."" Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California has also said she will push to get more authority for FERC in order to ensure that all power prices are reasonable -- for instance, by assessing civil penalties to power suppliers who engage in unfair pricing. But some in the energy industry say FERC already has plenty of authority -- it's just that the commissioners haven't exercised it properly. Opponents of extending FERC's role fear a tangle of federal bureaucracy reaching a local level. ""I think that, if FERC exercises the authority that I believe that they have in many of these areas, legislation is not necessary,"" says Dave Penn, executive vice president of American Public Power Association, a trade group of public utilities based in Washington, D.C. FERC itself isn't arguing strenuously for more authority. Chairman Pat Wood says additional affirmations of authority would probably save the agency time in court later. And he says he wouldn't mind having the ability to assess penalties on utilities that fail to provide reliable service. But he adds, ""While I welcome any authority they want to give us, what we've got in the statute now is plenty good enough."" -- TRANSMISSION: Transmission is an industrywide beef; it's widely acknowledged that with electricity now being sold over greater distances, the current system is overtaxed, risking bottlenecks and reliability problems. So the nation needs more lines. But who decides where to put them? Plus, with the same people selling power and running transmission lines, there's a natural inclination for those controlling the transmission lines to want to sell their own electricity first. FERC has ordered the industry to institute RTOs to run the transmission system to ensure fair access to transmission lines, no matter who owns them. Sen. Bingaman's proposals would affirm that power for FERC. And Mr. Wood says the RTOs can also handle siting of new transmission lines. But many states are unhappy with FERC's strategies. Some, fearing federal interference with the states' authority over siting, are taking steps to form their own multistate councils that would ensure regional cooperation while leaving control in state hands. And Maryland, the District of Columbia and Virginia are requesting a rehearing of a FERC order that they join RTOs, saying that federal regulators are moving with undue haste even in areas where transmission isn't a problem. -- INTERCONNECTION: In a competitive system, the growing number of new electricity generators must be able to connect to the power grid. But the interconnection of new generators with the old utilities that own the grid's transmission lines can raise two kinds of problems. On the technical side, newer generators can have different types of systems with different generating capacities, raising concerns of overloads and other problems. On the competitive side, utilities can make it difficult for new generators to connect to the grid. So, many in the industry are calling for uniform technical standards to allow equal access to the grid -- once a generator meets the standards, a utility would have no basis to deny a hookup -- and to ensure that interconnection doesn't risk the safety and reliability of the system. ""As we've moved into deregulation, there are more entities that want to connect to the system,"" says Ken Rose, a senior economist at the National Regulatory Research Institute at Ohio State University. There must be some means, he says, to ensure that access for all these new players remains fair. FERC's Mr. Wood says interconnection is ""a top priority"" for the agency. He has officially asked utilities to file their interconnection rules, and FERC will issue a policy on interconnection this fall. Chris Mele, legislative director of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners in Washington, D.C., says that interconnection rules need to be flexible. ""NARUC supports Congress requiring the establishment of national interconnection and power-quality standards that would be developed and adapted by an appropriate technical-standards organization,"" says Mr. Mele.

Energy (A Special Report) What Happened? --- Lessons From Across the Seas: Deregulation is working pretty well in Britain; But it has taken a long time By Geoffrey T. Smith 09/17/2001 The Wall Street Journal R9 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) LONDON -- For all those who just can't understand why electricity deregulation is worth bothering with: Look abroad. It has to be admitted that Europe's deregulation experience looks better than the U.S.'s largely because of the relative starting positions. Europe is the 300-pound couch potato who feels more of a difference after a month in the gym than the guy who is already quite fit. For decades, the European electricity industry was run by engineers patronized by politicians. The result: a hugely overbuilt system with rows of underused power plants and legions of unnecessary staff, paid for by sky-high, regulated rates. Deregulation is starting to put an end to all that. Electricity prices have fallen in most European markets, especially in Germany, since a European Union deregulation directive took effect in 1999. And in the United Kingdom, deregulation has gone further than in most of Europe. Electricity prices are down by around a third for families and businesses, and there are few problems with supply. But there is a catch -- an important one for an American public already weary of the pain of deregulation: In Britain, it has taken more than a decade to make deregulation start to work. Britain started out with a few advantages that places such as California don't have. Its policy is in the hands of a single, central government committed to deregulation, while U.S. state and federal regulators often disagree on what needs to be done. It started out owning the whole energy business and could carve it up as it pleased. As it deregulated, it didn't have to face the problem of exploding demand due to Silicon Valley and rapid population growth. And Britain, unlike California, started from a position of significant oversupply, and for years was liberal in allowing still more plants to be built because they would be fueled by cheaper and cleaner North Sea natural gas instead of coal. Despite all this, British electricity deregulation has had its share of false starts. For 10 years up until 1998, the whole process seemed to be bringing little in the way of concrete gains. For much of the decade, the government was a timid pioneer, relying on the blunt policy instrument of price controls to bring prices down when its fancy new market models didn't work. But Britain was also willing to try different approaches if its first choice failed -- perhaps a lesson for the U.S. Like California, Britain set up a wholesale pool for day-to-day power purchases; Britain scrapped the pool when it failed to bring prices down. Britain also allowed power buyers and sellers the crucial freedom to lock in their prices for months ahead, insulating them from the price zigzags that have crippled California's two largest investor-owned utilities and sent the biggest, PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric Co. unit, into Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. ""The U.K. has got the balance about right, but competition has been a long time in coming,"" says Richard Lewis, U.K. managing director of Enron Corp., Houston. The seeds were sown in 1988, when then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher decided to extend her free-market ideology to the electricity sector. The British government had a clear idea what it wanted to do. New laws were passed. Deregulation began. By contrast, Germany's federal government, which started the process at the end of 1998, has had to negotiate electricity deregulation with two other tiers of government and more than 800 electricity companies. Britain split the electricity sector into three parts: power generators, completely separate regional suppliers and National Grid PLC, to which it gave ownership and control of the country's high-voltage power lines. By separating the grid from the companies that actually sell and produce electricity, this structure ensured that no seller could keep others out of the market. The government sold majority stakes in all 12 English and Welsh regional electricity suppliers to the public in December 1990. Six months later, it had sold 60% each of National Power PLC and Powergen PLC, giving to those two companies almost all the coal-fired power plants in England and Wales. The sale of nuclear generator British Energy PLC followed in 1996. Managers across the sector started cutting cut costs agressively, especially for labor. With privatization, the design of new plants was increasingly influenced by economic factors, such as natural gas's cost advantage over coal, rather than political ones. Back in 1988, Britain's old Central Electricity Generating Board had wanted to build expensive new coal plants and nuclear reactors despite the presence of vast untapped natural-gas reserves right on the U.K.'s doorstep in the North Sea. But, thanks to privatization, almost all the new power plants built in the next 10 years were gas-fired. In fact, so many were built that the government slapped a moratorium on new plants in order to cushion, if not stop, the decline of the domestic coal industry. The moratorium was lifted last November. In the early 1990s, a model evolved in which the companies that distributed power to homes and businesses -- known as regional suppliers -- were allowed to charge a specified amount for getting the power to the customer; if a company could find a way to do it for less, it got to pocket most of the difference. Customers got lower bills, and the companies' shareholders were happy -- a little too happy, in fact, as the public started to resent the ""fat cat"" bosses who were seen as skimming off fat profits for little improvement in service. Deregulation really got going in 1994, when the government allowed industry to shop around for its power. A year later it gave up its rights to veto foreign takeovers of suppliers, starting a wave of U.S.-led takeovers. But within a few years most of the U.S. firms had either sold or said they intended to, although Dallas's TXU Corp. stayed and thrived. For much of the 1990s, it wasn't market forces that brought British electricity prices down. ""Almost all of the cuts in prices to consumers came from [our] price controls on monopolies,"" says Steve Smith, head of trading arrangements at the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets, the regulator that has implemented government policy under one name or another since 1990. Most of a household's bill comes from the cost of running the distribution network, not from producing the power. It was this distribution part of the business that bore the brunt of the price controls. The failure to bring down the price of power itself threatened to provoke a crisis in 1998, when the government finally extended competition to the household and small-business sectors. Nine years after the Electricity Act got the ball rolling, the market for customers was 100% open. But something still had to be done about the power generators' prices, which weren't falling as expected. In theory, British power generators had had to bid into a wholesale pool each day since 1990, telling the National Grid at what price each plant could supply power. The Grid would then buy as much power as needed from each plant, starting with the cheapest. But the pool didn't work. There were too few players in it. The generators' prices to resellers -- the regional suppliers -- stayed stubbornly flat. Accusations of market manipulation abounded, but could rarely be made to stick. The answer was NETA -- the New Electricity Trading Arrangements, which were the centerpiece of last year's Utilities Act. Under the new rules, which took effect March 27, electricity has become as close as it is ever likely to be to being a market like any other. Producers, consumers and intermediaries now all trade electricity directly with each other, up to 3 1/2 hours before they have to deliver or use it -- rather than buying power through an intermediary pool that buys from the generators. The grid operator still manages the physical flow of electricity, but intrudes only inasmuch as buyers and sellers have to notify it how much they intend to put into or take out of the grid at each half-hour of the day. NETA has galvanized competition. Prices for electricity have fallen 15% since March, according to British regulator Ofgem, and they continue to fall. But it's not a question of forcing prices down -- more of allowing the market to set the price of power. More than 7.8 million customers have switched suppliers since 1998. And the Electricity Association, a trade group for companies in the electricity business, reckons that households can cut almost GBP 30 ($43), or about 12%, off their annual bills by switching. At last, deregulation is working. ""NETA has definitely been the right framework to foster competition,"" says Brian Count, the new chief executive of Innogy PLC, a power generator and supplier that is one of two companies created last year by the breakup of the generation company National Power. But even as the free-marketers lean back and congratulate themselves on a job well done, storm clouds gather on the horizon. The Labour government, re-elected in June, has ordered the U.K.'s first national energy policy review in 20 years. The government is signaling that it wants more control over future investment decisions. The nuclear industry and renewable sources such as wind power look likely to benefit as the British government tries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. As Britain's own natural-gas reserves run out in the middle of this decade, it will become like the rest of Europe -- uneasily dependent on countries such as Algeria and Russia for supplies. Hence the support for nuclear power. The industry accepts all this, but Innogy's Mr. Count speaks for many when he says: ""For goodness' sake, don't let us now get dragged back to central planning and regulation."" --- Mr. Smith is an assistant news editor for Dow Jones Newswires in London.

Energy (A Special Report) What Now? --- On Second Thought: In the wake of California's power problems, many states are taking a wait-and-see approach to deregulation By Eileen O'Grady 09/17/2001 The Wall Street Journal R13 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) California's energy crisis has a lot of people wondering whether it's really such a good idea to let consumers shop for electricity. No one wants to repeat California's mistakes. So, while 12 states and the District of Columbia already offer residential and commercial energy consumers a choice of providers, and a handful are pressing ahead with plans to fully deregulate next year, some 20 others are either delaying deregulation plans or taking a hard look at whether they ought to move toward competition. And no state has started a new deregulation effort since California's blackouts and price spikes were first reported. But while the fervor for deregulation definitely has cooled, not all of the blame can be laid at California's doorstep. Indeed, in virtually all of the states that deregulated before California's troubles began -- particularly in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and New Jersey -- consumers have seen for themselves that many of the new entries in the power market haven't delivered on one of the new system's key promises: lower prices. Texas, Michigan and Virginia are expected to stick to their plans to open their electricity markets fully next year. But industry sources agree that a lot more states would be about to do the same if California's electricity troubles hadn't given them second thoughts. ""The advance of retail competition has definitely stalled,"" says Ken Rose, a senior economist at the National Regulatory Research Institute, at Ohio State University in Columbus, a research arm of a national trade group for state utility regulators. ""The question is whether it reverses,"" Mr. Rose adds. ""You would expect bumps in the road, maybe a slow start, but for the past year and a half it's not been going in the right direction."" While no state has repealed an electricity-deregulation law in the wake of California's troubles, seven states have altered their deregulation laws, mostly to delay the start of consumer choice by a few months or a few years -- until state regulators and legislators can see how deregulation plays out elsewhere. Oklahoma, one of those states, pushed its shopping start date back to 2004 or later, from July 1, 2002, worried that deregulation might jeopardize its below-average electric rates. ""California has slowed down the restructuring effort, but hasn't stopped it,"" says Oklahoma state Sen. Kevin Easley, a Democrat and an early supporter of deregulation. ""Long term, we think it's still a positive thing for Oklahoma."" As a major producer of natural gas, Oklahoma has attracted a large number of new power plants that run on natural gas. Deregulation, its local supporters say, thus could help the state create new jobs by encouraging more local power plants that export electricity, adding value to the state's natural resources. Nevada, where electricity demand is growing dramatically, used an emergency measure in April to delay the start of consumer choice for a third time. The measure also froze electricity rates until early next year and placed a moratorium on utility sales of power-generating plants. That effectively undid a customer-choice law passed in 1997, although the state will allow some large customers to shop for power next year. Wisconsin has no deregulation law, but its utilities were beginning to propose ways to divide their power-generation assets in order to create a competitive market. When California's problems emerged, however, Wisconsin Public Service Corp., a unit of WPS Resources Corp., Green Bay, withdrew a proposal that would have urged state regulators to allow the company to transfer some of its power plants to a separate company -- a first step toward deregulation. ""Wisconsin has been set back by California,"" says Larry Weyers, chairman of Wisconsin Public Service. ""Any talk of deregulation is met with a lot of opposition, and anything seen as changing the system is dead on arrival. Our plan could have been successful, but attitudes became cautious."" So much for the states that got cold feet. How are the pioneers faring? Not very well. Most electricity customers in fully deregulated states have seen few competitive options. Figures from regulators indicate that after an initial burst of consumer interest, new energy providers in New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania have seen significant reductions in numbers of customers. When New Jersey started letting consumers shop in 1999, about 2.2% of residential consumers switched to a new provider. Now, only 1.1% are still buying electricity from a company other than their incumbent utility. Even Pennsylvania, which was seen as the biggest deregulation success, ""is beginning to look more ordinary,"" says Mr. Rose, the regulatory economist. Some electricity retailers that pulled out of the state blamed a climate of fear arising from California's troubles. But rising wholesale power prices have taken their toll as well, says state consumer advocate Irwin Popowsky. In 1998, Pennsylvania residential customers had a choice of at least 30 alternative power providers. Today there are fewer than 10. The reason: The new entries proved unable to compete with the lower, capped rates offered by the incumbent utilities, industry sources say. Initially, Pennsylvania's biggest utility, Peco Energy Co., a unit of Chicago-based Exelon Corp., lost 44% of its industrial customers and 30% of its commercial clients to new suppliers, according to data published by the state consumer advocate's office in July 2000. One year later, however, many of those customers had returned to Peco, leaving the utility with a loss of only 4.7% of its industrial customers and 5% of its commercial clients. For residential power customers, the story's the same: Around the state, initially about 10% selected a new supplier before California's problems erupted. Today six of the state's seven original power companies have regained residential customers as competing suppliers leave the market and savings offered by those remaining shrink, Mr. Popowsky says. The number of residential customers being served by new suppliers dropped to 574,661 as of late June 2001, down 18% from March. ""It's a price issue,"" says Sharon Reishus, associate director at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Cambridge, Mass. Though wholesale power prices have fallen since the first part of the year, they remain unpredictable, she says. A competing provider might be able to make profits, say, 10 months of the year, but could still ""get killed in the spot market"" if prices spike, Ms. Reishus says. One of the biggest new competitors in Pennsylvania is New Power Co., a subsidiary of NewPower Holdings Inc., Purchase, N.Y. New Power bid for and won 250,000 Peco Energy customers around the time of Peco's 1999 merger with Unicom Corp. to become Exelon. But New Power's plans extend well beyond the borders of Pennsylvania. It has plans to sell natural gas and electricity to residential consumers and businesses around the U.S. ""We have seen some volatility in the Pennsylvania market due to the rise in wholesale prices,"" says H. Eugene Lockhart, president and chief executive officer of New Power. But, he adds, ""we remain committed to serving our customers there and hope to step up our marketing efforts in the near future."" But Houston-based Shell Energy Services, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group's Shell Oil Co., cited the slowing pace of retail access around the country for its recent decision to drop out of the hunt for new electric customers in Texas and Ohio -- even before markets in those states are fully open. Shell Energy Services had already signed up 40,000 residential customers in Texas and 30,000 in Ohio, but officials said that, given the slow progress of deregulation, it was unlikely the company would reach the size needed to be profitable in a reasonable length of time. The prospects for selling power to residential customers remain difficult, but the opportunity for marketing to business is brighter. Small businesses are seen as key for electricity suppliers seeking new customers, says Scott Gahn, managing director of commodity management at Enron Corp.'s Enron Energy Services unit, which markets power to business. ""Each month that goes by, we're adding gas and power customers in Maine, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Ohio and Texas,"" Mr. Gahn says. He even goes so far as to say that California's impact on deregulation hasn't been all bad. For energy markets in many states, he says, the California crisis ""has gotten the issue [of being able to choose your own provider] onto their radar screen in a way that you'd have to pay an advertising agency to do."" State officials in Texas, Michigan and Virginia, where consumers will start shopping next year, vow not to repeat California's mistakes. ""Everyone asks me, will we have California's problems?"" says Tom Noel, chief executive of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which runs the state's power grid. ""No, we won't have their problems, but we will have some of our own."" The Texas electricity market is very different from that of California. Texas has a copious supply of electricity, thanks to extensive construction of power plants powered by natural gas, which also is in plentiful supply locally. One reason California got into trouble: Its utilities had to import a lot of electricity and high-priced natural gas to meet the state's growing demand for power. Texas has attracted about two dozen companies to compete for consumers' business through a 1999 deregulation law that carved existing utilities into separate generating, transmission and retail units. It has been running a customer-choice pilot program ahead of its Jan. 1, 2002, debut of full deregulation. ""We're in this for the long haul,"" says New Power's Mr. Lockhart. ""With the opening of the market in Texas, there will be a national example of getting it right -- saving consumers money and giving them choices to help manage their energy use."" --- Ms. O'Grady is a reporter for Dow Jones Newswires in Houston.

Business/Financial Desk; Section C German Deal for U.S. Water Utility By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 09/17/2001 The New York Times Page 6, Column 3 c. 2001 New York Times Company In the first deal in the United States since the terrorist attacks of last week, American Water Works of Voorhees, N.J., has agreed to be sold to RWE, a German utility, for more than $5 billion, executives close to the transaction said yesterday. The deal, which is expected to be announced today before the markets open, will be a crucial test of investor confidence in mergers and acquisitions in the wake of the calamity. One executive said the transaction was being announced now partly as an effort to demonstrate the resolve of businesses worldwide. ''We discussed holding off for obvious reasons,'' the executive said. ''But we decided that we should press ahead. The markets need to know that business will continue as usual. And by that, I mean business -- the commerce of life -- will not stop in the face of terrorism.'' For RWE, the deal represents its latest effort to expand through acquisitions. Last year, RWE acquired Thames Water of Britain and the E'town Corporation of New Jersey. American Water Works, the largest publicly traded water utility in the nation, with annual revenue of $1.4 billion, has been acquisitive itself. It recently announced an agreement to buy the Azurix North America Corporation, the water utility of the Enron Corporation, and is about to complete a deal to buy the water assets of the Citizens Communications Company of Stamford, Conn. Spokesmen for American Water Works and RWE could not be reached for comment last night. Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Germany's RWE Agrees to Buy American Water Works for $4.6 Billion Plus Debt 09/17/2001 Dow Jones Business News (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) ESSEN, Germany -- German utility RWE AG said it has agreed to buy American Water Works Co., the largest publicly traded water utility in the U.S., for $4.6 billion, plus $3 billion in debt, in attempt to expand internationally. RWE said it would offer $46 per outstanding share of American Water Works, a 37% premium to American Water Works' share price in the past 30 days. The offer values American Water Works (AWK) at a total $7.6 billion, as RWE will offer $4.6 billion for the shares and assume $3 billion in debt, it said. Discussions between RWE and American Water had broken down late last month. When the transaction is complete, RWE plans to bundle American Water Works, which has a market capitalization of $3.3 billion, with its Thames Water operations in the U.K., RWE said. RWE is looking to expand internationally to close the gap with competing global utility firms Vivendi SA and Suez SA, both larger in size by market capitalization. Last year, RWE bought Thames Water PLC of Britain and also acquired E'town Corp. of New Jersey. American Water Works, Voorhees, N.J., is an aggressive buyer in its own right. It recently announced the purchase of Azurix North America Corp., the North American water-services division of Houston's Enron Corp. for $141.5 million, including $8.3 million of debt and tax savings of $13 million, for an enterprise value of $136.8 million. It scrapped a planned acquisition of water utility SJW Corp., San Jose, California, earlier this year after repeated regulatory delays. And it is expected to complete soon a nearly two-year-old deal to buy the water and waste-water assets of Citizens Communications Co., Stamford, Connecticut. RWE said shareholders representing 24% of American Water shares have already entered binding agreements to support the transaction. ""In addition to providing us with a top position in the U.S., the acquisition of American Water will further establish RWE as a global leader in the position of water services,"" RWE Chief Executive Dietmar Kuhnt said in a statement. ""The development of RWE's world-class water business in turn will provide greater balance to our core utility portfolio and allow us to deliver enhanced growth and shareholder value,"" he added. The deal is expected to be completed within 18 months to two years. The transaction will require shareholder and cartel authority approval. RWE's supervisory board and the board of American Water Works have approved the offer. Copyright (c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

BOMBAY, Sept 17 (Reuters) - U.S. energy firm Enron Corp's Dabhol Power Co said on Monday it has sought urgent funding from its foreign lenders to repay interest on past loans and preserve a $2.9 billion power plant that is lying idle. Dabhol, which is 65 percent owned by Houston-based Enron, said monthly interest payments to its lenders have to be made in September but it does not have enough cash. It has about 25 foreign lenders, which include ABN AMRO, Citibank, US Exim and Bank of America. ""The company has funds in its account to make certain payments and anticipates that some of those will be made. It has requested disbursement from banks towards the rest,"" the spokesman told Reuters. He did not disclose details of the interest payments nor the cash it wants. The project has been funded 70 percent by debt. Dabhol has not been earning any income after its sole customer, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), in May stopped buying any more power from its plant citing high tariffs. MSEB was buying the entire output from the plant's first phase of 740 MW and had committed to buy the second phase output of 1,444 MW when it was ready. Following the cancellation, foreign and local lenders stopped disbursals of around $400 million forcing complete stoppage of work on the second phase. They have also declined to provide funds to preserve expensive equipment from being damaged by natural elements. ""Without funds for preserving the facility, the physical assets will begin to deteriorate almost immediately, which in turn will further add to the overall cost of completion,"" the spokesman added. Dabhol now wants at least a portion of this $400 million amount disbursed to help it meet its interest payments and take care of the plant. The development is likely to put further pressure on India's federal government to solve the contentious dispute which has affected the country's efforts to attract foreign investment in the power sector. Three foreign power companies have already pulled out, including French giant Electricite de France . Analysts believe that a quick solution to the problem is key to restoring investor confidence. UGLY SPAT Once considered the showpiece of India's liberalisation programme, the Dabhol project is now being dubbed an example of political and bureaucratic bungling. Enron has announced its decision to sell its equity in the project to the federal government or any other company. It says MSEB is yet to pay bills worth $185 million. On Monday, Dabhol further upped the ante by slapping MSEB with two preliminary notices of termination. One is for not paying bills for the months of June and July and the other for MSEB's decision in May to cancel the power purchase agreement, the contract that governs the state board's purchase of power from Dabhol. This is the third such notice from Dabhol. In May, it served the first notice for non-payment of bills for December and January. The two fresh notices are a body blow for MSEB, analysts said as it means the state utility could end up fighting three separate arbitration battles. According to the power purchase agreement, all disputes will have to be settled by the International Court of Arbitration in London. As per this agreement, serving preliminary notice is followed by a six-month cooling off period. If the dispute is not settled by then, Dabhol can issue a final notice and the dispute automatically goes for arbitration. The six-month period for the first notice, which was issued in May, ends in November. If there is no settlement by then, MSEB will have to answer Dabhol's charges of non-payment of bills for December and January. The same procedure will be followed in the case of the other two notices. But efforts to solve the issue so far through arbitration have been delayed by domestic litigation. MSEB wants the dispute to be heard by local courts, while Dabhol is pressing for arbitration in London. The Bombay high court, which began hearing this dispute on Monday, is expected to give a final verdict soon. ($1=48.83 Indian rupees). Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. UK: INTERVIEW-Screen trading enhances metals market. By Martin Hayes 09/17/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. LONDON, Sept 17 (Reuters) - The emergence of electronic screen systems alongside existing open-outcry and telephone markets has enhanced trading in base metals, Paul Shuman, LME desk manager at Cargill Investor Services (CIS), said. ""From our perspective, because we are brokers and do not run a proprietary position, we are bound, and always will be, to try and get the best price for our customers. The more platforms there are for us to trade on, the better for our customers,"" Shuman told Reuters. The London Metal Exchange (LME), the world's leading non-ferrous metals market, introduced an automated trading system (ATS) known as Select in February, and unveiled a more sophisticated phase last week. The LME's system joined rival platforms managed by Spectron Metals and Enron Online, part of Enron Corp. These systems have improved market liquidity and increased price transparency throughout the day, Shuman said. ""Instead of being restricted to the ring and the telephone market, where you have to ring around, you have instant access to bids and offers all through the day."" ""Now when we give our customers a market we can do that on the basis of the best bid and offer on the screen. From our company's perspective it has been very helpful,"" he said. Spreads between bids and offers have narrowed and access to the market has become faster. ""It is certainly a tighter market, a quicker market, and probably a more liquid market, he said. SCREENS NOT PARAMOUNT However, the LME's ATS is not designed to replace open-outcry on the 124-year-old exchange. Rather, it will complement the current mix of inter-office phone trading and open-outcry. ""Screens do not replace the ability to talk to one another,"" he said. There are instances when customers needs to transact a highly complex, multi-legged carry or spread trade, and it is unlikely that any system will be able to replicate that. ""You phone up another broker and say what you want to do. You either have to do it face-to-face or on the phone - you cannot do it on the screen - speed is important."" He said there may well be a fall-off in volume at one or other of the current platforms, but the screens and the telephone market are likely to run in tandem, while the LME plans to continue open-outcry ring trading as well. ""For the customers, they are going to get the best of all worlds,"" he added. LME SCREENS GAINING ACCEPTANCE On the screens the dust has still to settle between the rivals, but there are signs that LME Select is being used more by the market. ""In the last few weeks, Select has done better as more people have become used to it, and it (Select) is free, whereas some others are not,"" Shuman said. And now the Select system is much more capable after the release of the second, more sophisticated phase. ""It is very ambitious and it will be interesting to see how it works,"" he said. The second release incorporates a unique request-for-quote function. This allows traders to direct enquiries, such as market size and depth, to as many or as few respondents as required, and whether or not to be anonymous. It also covers all the LME's contracts - the initial release was confined to the basic cash, three months and cash-to-threes spread contracts. ""It is going to take a while for Select Two to become the tool for the industry. But Cargill is in favour of anything that allows us to give a better service to our customers,"" Shuman said.

French Electricity Bourse To Run Tests Before Launch 09/17/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) PARIS -(Dow Jones)- French electricity bourse, Powernext SA took one step closer to its imminent launch with the announcement Monday that it will host a series of simulations from Sept. 25. Powernext will stage three sets of simulations, the first from Sept. 25 to Sept. 27, the second on Oct. 2-4, and the third on Oct. 9-11, Powernext said in a press statement. Close to 20 companies will participate in the tests, including electricity suppliers, traders, the exchange's investors, industrial consumers and traders. TXU Europe Energy Trading and Enron will be among the participants. The exchange is also holding seminars this week for participants to get acquainted with the ElWeb electronic trading system, also currently used by Nord Pool in the Nordic region, the market model, and Clearnet, the exchange's financial guarantor. Jean-Francois Conil-Lacoste, Powernext's director-general, said the exchange is still on track for its official launch later this autumn, although a date hasn't been set yet. Euronext Paris SA and HGRT, a financial holding for European electricity grid operators, hold 34% and 17% of Powernext, respectively. Currently, Electricite de France (F.EDF) is the sole shareholder in HGRT, although the long-range plan envisions Dutch grid operator, TenneT and Belgian counterpart, Elia as potential investors. Powernext aims to expand its activities in the Benelux region, dovetailing newly created Euronext, formed through a merger of the Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam stock exchanges. Powernext will also announce later this autumn the addition of new investors. Currently, the remaining 49% is divvied up among French banks BNP Paribas (F.BNP), and Societe Generale (F.SGF), plus state-owned EDF, oil giant TotalFinaElf (TOT) and Belgian utility Electrabel (B.ELE), which each hold 9.8%. These stakes will fall to 5.0% with the entry of the new investors, the threshold necessary to hold one seat on the board of directors. The exchange plans to initially offer physical electricity in hourly blocks for delivery the next day. Separately, EDF Trading, the London-based trading joint venture of EDF with commodities trader Louis Dreyfus, will start trading in the French wholesale market Oct. 1., EDF's Director of Client Services, Loic Caperan, said last week. EDF Trading is barred by the European Union Competition Authority from trading in the French retail market. The trading arm isn't allowed to assist EDF to structure contracts for France's energy-intensive industrial consumers, the group eligible to choose suppliers representing about one-third of domestic power consumption. But the entry of EDF Trading into the wholesale market is viewed by some traders as crucial to injecting necessary liquidity for electricity trading to flourish in France. The pace of power market deregulation is slowly starting to pick up in France. Powernext is the second project to launch this autumn aimed at kick-starting trading. Last week, EDF auctioned options on close to 1,200 megawatts of local power production. As the E.U.'s second-largest power market, which shares its borders with five countries and is connected to the U.K. via an under-water electricity interconnector, France is key to the eventual formation of a pan-European traded market. -By Sarah Wachter, Dow Jones Newswires; 331-4017-1740; sarah.wachter@dowjones.com -0- 17/09/01 09-56G Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

RWE to Buy American Water Works for $7.6 Billion (Update6) 2001-09-17 07:02 (New York) RWE to Buy American Water Works for $7.6 Billion (Update6) (Adds where American Water is based in second paragraph, moves stock drop to seventh, adds context in third paragraph.) Essen, Germany, Sept. 17 (Bloomberg) -- RWE AG, Europe's No. 4 power company, agreed to buy American Water Works Inc., the biggest publicly traded U.S. water utility, for $7.6 billion in cash and assumed debt in a bid to catch up with larger rivals. RWE is offering $46 in cash per share, 35 percent more than last Monday's close, for the Vorhees, New Jersey-based company. Germany's RWE will assume $3 billion of American Water's debt, said Chief Financial Officer Klaus Sturany on a conference call. The purchase will add more than 10 million U.S. customers to RWE's water unit and further reduce its reliance on the German electricity market. It will also help RWE narrow the gap to Suez SA and Vivendi Environnement SA a year after Chief Executive Dietmar Kuhnt spent $9.8 billion on Thames Water Plc of the U.K. ``RWE has said it wants to expand in water, and this is another step in that direction,'' said Ulf Moritzen, who helps manage 100 million euros ($93 million) at Nordinvest. ``In the current situation, it makes sense to buy a defensive business.'' The planned purchase isn't cheap. Including debt, RWE will pay about 5.4 times sales for the U.S. company, compared with 4.9 times sales for Thames Water. In the U.S., buyers paid about 4 times sales for the 15-plus takeovers in the country's water industry over the past two years, according to Bloomberg data. Stock Drops Including pending acquisitions by the U.S. company, the price will rise to about $8.4 billion by closing, said Sturany. RWE will sell an unspecified amount of new bonds to finance the purchase, he said, without giving a time frame. RWE shares fell as much as 2.27 euros, or 5.5 percent, to 38.90 euros in Frankfurt. They've declined 17 percent this year. American Water shares closed at $34.12 last Monday, the last day U.S. markets were open before the terrorist attacks. The acquisition is the biggest announced since terrorists attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon last Tuesday. Sturany said the companies reached an agreement last week, though they decided to delay the announcement because of the disaster. ``We have enormous confidence in the U.S. economy,'' Sturany said. ``Despite the enormity of the events, we expect the U.S. market to prevail.'' He said the contract with American Water doesn't include any special clauses related to the attack. After the purchase, which may take as long as two years to complete, the Essen, Germany-based company will have 56 million water customers worldwide, according to spokesman Bill McAndrews. Suez and Vivendi each serve more than 100 million people. More Purchases Sturany said American Water, which will become a unit of Thames Water, will expand further in the U.S. by using the German company's ``strong balance sheet.'' The Thames Water purchase last year gave RWE New Jersey-based utility E'town Corp. RWE said the new acquisition will make it the largest water company in the U.S., the world's biggest single market. American Water has customers in 23 U.S. states, the German company said. The U.S. market, with more than 54,000 local utilities, is ``ripe'' for consolidation, he said. RWE today said the latest purchase will help boost earnings before goodwill in the first year after completion. The company had sales of $1.35 billion last year and employs 5,000 people throughout the U.S. RWE's total debt will rise to about 8 billion euros ($7.4 billion) after the purchase, Sturany said. RWE's debt-to- equity ratio was about 2.8 before the purchase compared with 41 times for Vivendi Environnement, according to Bloomberg data. The yield on RWE's outstanding 6.5 percent 20-year bond rose 0.1659, or 0.2 percent, to 100.0455 after the announcement. RWE in April sold 3.46 billion euros worth of bonds to help pay for Thames Water, including 350 million pounds in 20-year bonds. RWE has an ``Aa3'' rating from Moodys' Investors Service and a ``AA-'' rating from rival agency Standard & Poor's. Merrill Lynch & Co. and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter advised RWE on the U.S. purchase. Goldman Sachs advised American Water. RWE said 24 percent of American Water's shareholders are already backing its takeover offer, which has also been approved by the German and the U.S. companies boards of directors. Enron India Unit Serves Second Notice to Cancel Power Contract 2001-09-17 08:50 (New York) Mumbai, Sept. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Dabhol Power Co., Enron Corp.'s Indian unit, said it has served a second notice on the state-owned Maharashtra State Electricity Board stating that it will start proceedings to cancel its power supply contract because its waiting to be paid past dues. Enron owns 65 percent of Dabhol Power Co., which runs the $3 billion power plant, India's biggest foreign investment. It is owed $64 million by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its sole customer, in unpaid bills for 9 months. The board in May stopped buying power, saying it's too expensive. ``Little progress has so far been made on reaching a fair and reasonable solution'' to the payments dispute, the company said in a statement. Enron on May 19 issued the first notice to cancel the power supply contract with the board. It began looking to sell its stake in the project after the negotiation panel failed to get other buyers for its power. Eight Indian states said they would buy electricity but at less than half the price charged by Dabhol. Enron said it has invested $875 million in the project and is ready to sell to the government its stake at cost.

THE FRIDAY BURRITO Ben Zycher from the RAND Corporation used the following line in his talk at the WPTF General Meeting in Phoenix a few weeks ago. The story takes place in the good ol' days of the Soviet Union when Brezhnev was Premier. Brezhnev and the rest of the Politburo one fine May Day were watching the tanks and missiles pass by the Kremlin Wall, when Leonid noticed in the middle of the parade a truck carrying a group of civilians.=01; He turned t= o Dmitri Ustinov, the Defense Minister, and asked, ""Who are they?""=01; Ustino= v replied, ""Those are our economists.=01; You just wouldn't believe their destructive potential."" This is appropriate for our time and our situation.=01; The economists descended upon us when the California market was designed, but we know not from where.=01; Aliens?=01; Since weaving conspiracy theories is a popular = past time in Sacramento (""We just know they are gouging us, them bullies""), I believe that one must do the same by following the money.=01; I'm not talki= ng about the campaign contributions in Gray Davis' pocket. The most money has gone from power sales in California to the Canadian Province of British Columbia.=01; It was a plot the Canadians hatched. I mean, look at Governor Davis.=01; He looks kind of BC-ish.=01; Skinny and lanky, wimpy hair, and a hesitation in his speech. He talks their language: a mix of misspelled French (""meet me at the centre""), English, and Eh(?).=01; One night in 1996= , the BC government secretly sent us some economists by the truckload to destroy California.=01; The utilities probably paid for the bus tickets.=01= ; I happen to know that Frank Wolak, Chair of the ISO Market Surveillance Committee once lectured at a University in Vancouver, B.C..=01; What more evidence do you need?=01; The BC Government sent us cheap hydro power, sold= at inflated market prices so that they could do what the citizens of California wanted to do with their budget largess ? build roads, schools, and hospitals. They didn't think we could figure out their plot, but we did.=01; Now is the time for California to counter-attack.=01; We'll send t= hem some of our politicians, a bipartisan group including a few who can add, and some of our select energy thugs from the CPUC and the Blind Oversight Board. Speaking of times and situations, there was a time when discussing the ISO, words such as ""communist"" and ""Nazi"" were only uttered, by my pal, Carl Imparato,.=01; We would shake our heads, and chuckle at Carl's extremism.= =01; We aren't laughing now.=01; The descriptors seem to arise again and again in polite conversation by a wider circle of people.=01; I watch with utter amusement (because the alternative is retching breakfast) at the demagoguery of the ISO Governing Board, the Market Despair Team, the Governor's office, and some members of the California Legislature. Like an audience watching a tragedy from hell, we scream aloud, ""These people are crazy!""=01; And indeed, they are.=01; Mr. President is not helping us at al= l by continuing to wrangle over who gets the musical Chair at FERC ? Bubba Curt or Bubba Patrick.=01; Listen to us, Mr. President.=01; Let Bubba Curt keep = the reigns for a year or two, and let Bubba Patrick take a seat at the table. We need someone with a shockproof BS detector.=01; Someone who can honestly field a motion to dismiss the California ISO.=01; The time is long overdue = to shoot this horse in the head. Not all is evil.=01; This week in Houston, the resource capital of Californ= ia, I visited the trading floor folks at Dynegy, before attending the WTPF Board meeting.=01; The coolest thing I saw, besides all the neat gadgets on each trader's desk, was the coffee machine.=01; Brother Jolly Hayden showed= me how to use it.=01; You pick the type of coffee you want.=01; The contents o= f the coffee are in a shot-glass sized plastic tub with a foil top.=01; I picked Venezuelan #6 Decaffeinated Waxy Crude.=01; The tub is placed inside the brewing machine, and the start button is pushed.=01; Presto, coffee drips f= rom the spout into a waiting cup.=01; I asked Jolly, ""How did the hot water get mixed into the ground beans?""=01; He removed the tub from the machine and showed me a pin prick hole made in the foil top, and another that was made at the bottom.=01; Is that neat, or what? I would like to buy a brewing machine just like the Dynegy coffee machine, but a little larger.=01; I would set up a booth in Sacramento, on the corne= r of 11th and ""L"", and bark out to passing members of the Legislature, ""Free space shuttle. Come and see life on other planets.""=01; They would jump at = the chance to visit other planets.=01; I would seat them in the machine, push t= he start button, and voila.=01; Dripping out would be the essence of democracy= . Don't worry about the holes needed at the top and the bottom.=01; They are already there, and quite enlarged. Back to my day at Dynegy.=01; Trade floors might seem similar across companies, but the small differences speak to the management style embraced by the crew and its leaders.=01; Each electric trading desk, for various pa= rts of the country, is set up a little bit differently.=01; For example, some desks have a person doing asset-backed trading, but some don't.=01; When I arrived at 6 a.m., Houston time, the Eastern desk was busy in its trade day.=01; The Western folks hadn't arrived, yet.=01; Later, I sat with Randy LeForce of the Western desk.=01; ""Captain LeForce, to you"", he told me.=01;= He could talk big because Dave Francis, who sits next to Randy, and hangs witty quotes from the ceiling above his head (""Even a blind pig could make money in this market""), was on vacation.=01; As the pace of the trading gathered steam, Randy kept an eye on all the different people working the Western trading desk.=01; The Captain worked it like a maestro. During my visit, some Dynegy folks came up to me, introduced themselves, and said how much they enjoyed the Friday Burrito.=01; I'll tell you what. There are few things in life that give me as much satisfaction.=01; Complet= e strangers who tell you that something you do makes them feel good, well, it doesn't get any better than that.=01; Garrison Keillor, the well-known auth= or of Lake Woebegone Days, and NPR radio entertainer once said a writer should have an audience.=01; Not everyone in the world should be in the audience, = but an audience nonetheless of some people.=01; I now know what he means.=01; A= nd the people I met on the trading floor felt like they knew me, and shared with me their thoughts and opinions on a lot of things.=01;=01; Often they asked= me, ""Are those California people really that crazy?"" Since last week, you might have noticed the pace at the FERC has picked up, somewhat.=01; Last Friday the FERC issued an Order on possible refunds for alleged overcharges by parties selling to the ISO last January.=01; That wa= s news worthy.=01; Then, on Wednesday, the FERC issued an Order to remove barriers to additional electric generation in the West.=01; The Order admit= s that it won't change the dire situation in the West, but these are steps in the right direction.=01; The FERC also issued on Wednesday a show-cause ord= er to AES and Williams regarding the maintenance of RMR units that were called by the ISO in April and May of 2000.=01; That is a serious case that we mus= t watch closely.=01; Also this week, the California Senate kicked off its own investigation (this will be the tenth such investigation of the California markets to uncover alleged price manipulation).=01; The Senate Committee wi= ll have subpoena rights, and if I understand it correctly, they plan to subpoena individuals.=01; Sounds like a Kangaroo Court and a Three-Ring Circus, to me. Thursday, Secretary Abraham stated in a congressional hearing that the West would certainly experience power outages this summer. Finally, an LA Times reporter asked me if I had heard that a small QF company had filed for seizure of SCE property to satisfy an outstanding debt.=01; That would be step one of the bankruptcy cha-cha.=01; All in all,= a typical week among crazy people. Let's see what else we can talk about. Things in the People's Republic of California =01;@@@ PUC Updates Utility Liabilities =01;@@@ Be a Source for Energy Price Update =01;@@@ BPA Misquoted in the WSJ Things FERC =01;@@@ Market Monitoring Proposal Letters Jobs and People Odds & Ends (_!_) =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D Things in the People's Republic of California =01;@@@ PUC Updates Utility Liabilities My favorite regulator, the California PUC, issued an Order in the Utilities' Rate Stabilization case to re-open the record on utility audits. Although the text of the order is unremarkable, the data tables bring up to date, as of March 8, the outstanding liabilities of PG&E and SCE. The PG&E commercial paper obligation due as of March 8 increased by $354 million since January 31, for a total default amount of $790 million.=01; Q= F purchases increased by $280 million for the same five-week period, now totaling $651 million.=01; The ISO payments increased $934 million, now totaling $1.5 billion, and the direct access charge backs for negative PX credits increased $214 million, now totaling $433 million.=01; PG&E's total default amount is now $3.3 billion excluding amounts yet to be collected from PG&E customers for DWR purchases. The SCE balance is as follows: The commercial paper obligation that is due as of March 8 increased by $260 million since January 31, for a total default amount of $401 million. SCE defaulted on a significant amount of long-term debt principal and interest, roughly $249 million.=01; QF purchas= e defaults increased by $354 million for the same five-week period, now totaling $835 million.=01; The ISO obligations decreased $1.1 million, and = the direct access charge backs for negative PX credits increased $21 million, now totaling $25 million.=01; SCE's total default amount is now $1.7 billio= n excluding amounts yet to be collected from SCE customers for DWR purchases. There is little question that the QFs are taking it on the chin, big time. In the last five weeks, between January 31 and March 8, the defaulted payments to the QF owners from both utilities has increased $630 million. The total QF default for both utilities as of March 8 stands at $1.5 billion.=01; Does anyone wonder why 1500 MW of QF capacity has shut down in California?=01; Without these payments being made very soon, I would expect the amount of shut down QF capacity to easily double, or more.=01; Why woul= d these projects produce without the promise of being paid? Things in the People's Republic of California =01;@@@ Be a Source for Energy Price Update Art O'Donnell, editor and associate publisher of the well-known and widely read California Energy Market (CEM), is looking for traders willing to participate in his survey in exchange for receiving an advanced copy.=01; T= he Survey is a regular feature in CEM. The information collected by Art is matched against the responses of the other people he interviews and some posted sources (Pricewaterhouse Coopers; BPA's daily offerings, for instance).=01; It is written up in narrative form. The report goes out twic= e weekly, once on Wednesday afternoon/evening via e-mail as a courtesy to the respondents (because the week is pretty much done by then), and a rewrite on Friday that is e-mailed around 10 am, posted on the newsdata.com Web site, and published in the newsletter for general consumption. The Friday report also features a brief story about natural gas markets in the West The WPTF Board of Directors has allowed me to publicize this offering, and to explain that if your company is interested in participating, the information you provide to Art would be protected as confidential.=01; In Art's words, ""The price survey is ? unlike some attempts at creating a tradable index number (e.g. McGraw-Hill's Power Markets Week index or the Dow Jones indices), is more of a narrative about the state of the market d a pulse reading as opposed to a blood pressure number or an EKG. As such, I do not ask traders and schedulers for precise dollar figures or volumes associated with specific trades, but rather questions like, 'What's Mid-Columbia going for today? What about off-peak? How has that changed since this morning? Oh yeah, why is that? Anything else I should know?'"" The WPTF Board asked Art to explain how the information he collects would be protected since so many marketers and generators are under State data subpoenas.=01; Art replied, ""The Constitution of the State of California provides for a blanket immunity against government intrusions for news gathering from confidential sources and unpublished information, something which we believe in strongly at Energy NewsData Corporation and which we are willing to go to jail to protect. So if, for instance, the Attorney General tried to subpoena me or anyone from my staff about power price information, we would 1) refuse to divulge anything other than the already published accounts, 2) send back a copy of the Constitution, 3) contact the attorneys for the Society of Professional Journalists, and 4) start preparing a benefit party to raise legal fees. "" If you would like to participate in Art's survey, please e-mail him at aod@newsdata.com. Things in the People's Republic of California =01;@@@ BPA Misquoted in the WSJ In last week's Burrito, I referred to a Wall Street Journal article that portrayed a BPA trader as admonishing the DWR for accepting bids over market prices.=01; I was surprised when I received the following e-mail fro= m BPA's David Mills.=01; His message to me copied a letter he sent to DWR's R= ay Hart, explaining what he meant as opposed to what he was quoted as saying. Dear Ray: As per our telephone discussion, I just wanted to reiterate a few things re:the Wall Street Journal article and the quotes attributed to me.=01; At = no time during the interview with Ms Smith did I state that I thought that CDWR's offers were out of line with the prevailing market price in California or that your traders should check that price before entering the market.=01; The reporter was quite interested in the price difference betwe= en California and the MidC price here in the Northwest and when I asked I told her that currently that price delta was roughly $50-$100 MWhr, with MidC being lower than the CA prices.=01; I did not indicate to the reporter that= I thought that CDWR was paying more than the California market price and was simply trying to make a comparison of price relativity between California and the Northwest.=01; Lastly, BPA has, on occasion, charged extra-regional entities less than the prevailing market price but has only done so to remain consistent with our own pricing strategies. =01;I apologize for any misconceptions or miscommunications that may have resulted from this and look forward to a continuing working relationship between CDWR and BPA. Things FERC =01;@@@ Market Monitoring Proposal FERC Staff issued a report with ""Recommendations on Prospective Market Monitoring and Mitigation for the California Wholesale Electric Power Market.""=01; WPTF members are taking this proposal very seriously, and we intend to provide comments on March 22.=01; If you are interested in a copy= of the report, go to General members are able to participate along with the Board members and other general members working on our response.=01; We have retained the services of Dr. Ben Zycher of the RAND Corporation to help us draft the policy issues.=01; He will be working with our counsel, Dan Douglass of Art= er & Hadden to craft our reply. In short, our submission will point out the flaws in FERC's proposed methodology, and demonstrate the shortcomings of narrowly limiting the definition of producer marginal cost to operating variable cost.=01; Furthe= r, excluding measures of credit worthiness are an important missing variable in the FERC analysis.=01; Next week, I will include a short summary of our response in the Burrito. Letters I received a note from one of our legal beagles that drop me a line every now and then.=01; I don't have the facts of the case to which this person refers, but I hope the sender provides us with an update if a judgement should occur. ""Universal Studios wants FERC to find that Universal owes no penalty to SCE for not interrupting its interruptible load (under a CPUC rate schedule) because SCE did not adhere to the FERC requirement in the Dec 15 order to schedule 95% of its load in the day ahead market ...... according to Universal, if SCE had done so, then it would have had to provide Universal power at below its cost.=01; SCE didn't and Universal; go= t interrupted and now Universal owes $$$$$$$$$$$$$.""=01; Does anyone else kno= w about this filing? Lind Guerry, veteran of the PX halcyon days, wrote, ""Hi Gary.=01; Hope you'= re having a nice day.=01; Just wanted to let you know that I'm really enjoying the Burrito, and am so glad you're sending it to my home email.=01; I reall= y got a kick out of the ""Ten Reasons....""=01; It's hard to believe that our wonderful state is in such incompetent hands, isn't it?=01; And not only ar= e they incompetent, they continue to remain so, with such regularity, you could probably make a killing marketing their incompetence as a laxative. Do you think if we tried to do that, we'd get accused of exercising market power? Think of the power we'd wield, as the holder of the largest amount of incompetence!! "" Lind, we need a product name for the laxative idea.=01; Any ideas? How abou= t Sane Away? Jobs and People The folks at Dynegy sent me a couple of job postings.=01; If your company h= as similar posting or job openings, or if you are reader looking for a new gig, drop me a line.=01; After all, it's free. Position Description: Dynegy's position has responsibility for the development of transmission and power markets in a geographic region of the U.S.=01; Duties are driven primarily by federal, regional, and state activities to restructure and deregulate the electric power industry, and the need for industry participants to develop and implement market structures, policies, and regulations that promote liquid and competitive transmission and power markets.=01; Significant activity within a region to reshape the structure = and operation of the transmission grid is resulting from FERC Order 2000, which directs the establishment of Regional Transmission Organizations. Extensive travel (40%-60%, and higher at times) is highly probable. Primary goals of this position are to:1) Create more liquid and competitive transmission and power markets;=01; 2) Maximize the value of Dynegy's positions and assets b= y working closely with the trading and power groups to develop=01;=01; and implement commercial strategies that create and capture significant business opportunities; and 3) Provide timely and accurate information, market intelligence, and recommendations to clients. 4) Maximize the value of Dynegy's positions and assets by working closely with the trading and power groups to develop and implement commercial strategies that create and capture significant business opportunities; and recommendations to clients. Interested parties should contact Jolly Hayden at jjha@ngccorp.com. Odds & Ends (_!_) First, I would like to welcome WPTF's newest general member, Wellhead Electric.=01; Hal Dittmer is the founder and president of Wellhead.=01; I h= ave known Hal for a couple of years, first as a client for my over priced consulting services, and later as a friend and source of all kinds of useful information.=01; Wellhead is one of those QF owners who are owed a boatload of money.=01; However, Hal's company is developing some new projec= ts, and he is looking for prospective power buyers.=01; Hence, his interest in WPTF is obvious. Wellhead is WPTF's 31st member. Well, the Dynegy gang has been a source of comfort and joy to me this week. They couldn't let me leave their abode without stuffing a song in my pocket that is a tribute to their creative skills.=01; Timely too.=01; Sing it to = the tune of ""California Dreaming"", by the Mamas and the Papas. ISO California (to the tune of Hotel California) On a dark Western highway No wind in my hair No rain for the hydro No NOX in the air Up ahead in the distance I saw a flickering sight The load grew heavy and the lights grew dim No relief in the night So we stood in the darkness Down at the Taco Bell And I was thinking to myself This could be Heaven or this could be Hell We lit up a candle No power in the Bay There were voices down the corridor I thought I heard them say=01; ? Welcome to the ISO California Such a lovely place Such a lovely place Such a lovely face Powering up for the ISO California What a nice surprise What a nice surprise Bring your alibis=01; ? Its mind is policy twisted Can't stop consumption trends Got a lot of NIMBY boys Cisco calls friends How we sweat in the courthouse Sweet summer sweat Without the AC We try to forget So I called up the Gov'nor Please energize this line He said We haven't built a new plant here since 1969 Last thing I remember We were running for the door We had to find the passage back to the place we were before Relax said Judge Damrell California's programmed to receive Go belly up any time you like But your power can never leave [refrain] =3D Don't refrain.=01; Have a great weekend, y'all. gba

This action comes only a day before FERC and other witnesses will testify on the Feinstein/Smith price cap legislation before the Senate Energy Committee, Gov. Davis and FERC will testify before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee on Wednesday, and the House Financial Services Committee joins the fray with a hearing on the California energy situation on Wednesday. The latter committee will probably base its jurisdiction over some aspect of energy policy on a number of factors, including its jurisdiction over presidential economic emergency powers. The committee staff has in the past expressed interest in derivatives and other financial aspects of energy trading and markets. We are checking now to quietly determine whether these issues will be on Wednesday's agenda.

Subject:: California's dim bulbs
Body:: You may have seen this when it first came out a while back ... but it's worth a rerun. ---------------------- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/NA/Enron on 06/13/2001 01:49 PM --------------------------- From: Ann M Schmidt on 06/13/2001 01:49 PM To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: California's dim bulbs California's dim bulbs P J O Rourke 04/01/2001 Regulation 64 Copyright (c) 2001 Bell & Howell Information and Learning Company. All rights reserved. Copyright Cato Institute Spring 2001 THE FINAL WORD CALIFORNIA IS IN THE MIDST OF AN ENORmous stupidity crisis. Californians have been sitting in the dark because ... they didn't turn the lights on. They say they're short of electricity. Yes, they are. Between 1988 and 1998, California's electricity consumption increased by 15 percent. Meanwhile California's capacity to generate electricity shrank by five percent, even as the state hesitated to build new power lines to tap into neighboring states' power supplies. Californians didn't want dams across their rivers, derricks on their ocean, power lines across their borders, or fossil fuel smoke in their sky. These might interfere with all the smart things Californians do, such as hang-glide. California was going to rely on ""negawatts"" - dramatic power conservation. (But California regulators put price controls on electricity that lowered prices, and even Californians weren't dumb enough to skip a bargain.) And California was going to rely on alternative power generation. With all the puffery from Silicon Valley dot.com start-ups, wind farms wouldn't be a problem. And doesn't Gwyneth Paltrow's star shine bright enough to operate a solar panel? But it turns out that alternative power generation is an alternative, mostly, to generating power. Californians are people who insist on growing their own vegetables, but they won't dig up the pretty lawn, won't plant anything for fear of getting dirty, and they use fragrant bath salts from The Body Shop instead of smelly compost. Let them make their crudites with crab grass. President Bush was wrong to grant an extension of executive orders requiring out-of-state utilities to supply power to California. And everyone is wrong to listen to Californians whine about electricity deregulation. There never was any deregulation. The California Public Utilities Commission merely changed its regulations, which apparently weren't stupid enough to meet Golden State standards. Under California's 1996 re-regulation plan, electric companies sold their generating plants and became distributors. They were required to buy their power on the wholesale spot market and forbidden to enter into any long-term power supply contracts. Retail electricity prices were lowered by 10 percent and frozen at the new rate until March 2002. This is like requiring A&P to sell you porterhouse at $2 a pound, no matter what the price of beef on the hoof. Imagine how many steaks there would be, and how many supermarkets. Go to one of those boarded-up grocery stores, purchase a phantom T-bone, screw it into a ceiling fixture, and try to light your house. You're in California. Californians devised a system of electricity sales that ignored every dimension of the free market. (Interesting that the ""Information Economy"" is centered in a place that's immune to information.) The free market is a yardstick, and Californians got smacked with it. Mideast oil jitters, cold weather, natural gas price spikes, and the plain unpredictable freedom of the free market caused wholesale electricity costs to rise and California utilities to go $12 billion into the red. California's governor Gray Davis responded with the full force of bikini beach brain. In a January 8 speech to the state legislature, Davis proposed creating a state agency to buy generating plants and build new ones. He threatened to expropriate power generators and transmission grids. He called for laws to allow criminal prosecution of wholesale suppliers who withheld electricity from California markets. And he said the state's universities and community colleges would build co-generating plants and become energy independent. (With gas produced by the cafeteria food?) Gray Davis sounded like Joseph Stalin with the IQ of Keanu Reeves. ""Everyone should understand that there are other, more drastic measures that I am prepared to take if I have to,"" Davis declaimed. ""Take"" is the key word. Grabby Californians tried to regulate themselves into some cheap electricity. Hoggish California power companies went along because the stateimposed retail price ceiling was also a retail price floor. According to the Los Angeles Times, during the first 28 months of the scheme, Pacific Gas and Electric and California Edison made $20 billion from the legally required mark-up between wholesale and retail electric prices. Californians want to snatch that money back. ""Consumer advocates around California... said it did not matter that the utilities were returning investments to their shareholders,"" reported the January 31 Washington Post. ""They took the money and ran,"" said state senator John Burton. As opposed to Californians, who took the electricity and roller-bladed? Now the juice and the jack are both gone, and the California legislature has had to pass a bill authorizing $10 billion to try to clean up the mess. But the Californians could still pull a scam. The bill mandates long-term power contracts at rates that are way above what future prices should be. The hope, one guesses, is that Congress, or the President, or somebody will let the state skip out on those contracts once the costs are lower. It would be wrong to call Californians stupid. They're sleazy, too. R J. O'Rourke is the Cato Institute's H. L. Mencken Research Fellow and is foreign affairs desk chief for Rolling Stone.

Subject:: Chairman Tauzin on Negawatts
Body:: Today's Washington Post contains a favorable comment on negawatts attributed to House Energy & Commerce Committee Chairman Tauzin, following efforts we made yesterday with the Chairman and his staff, both directly and via our consultants. The Post article reads, ""In the coming months, Tauzin said, Congress will take steps to allow consumers to sell power back to their local energy grids."" We, of course, will continue to push for a version of this concept that keeps this process open to multiple buyers and sellers, not just the local utility. The article dovetails with information directly from Chairman Tauzin and Chairman Barton that they will continue to push our demand buydown proposal, although we are working with them to shore up support on the committee in the face of opposition from the usual suspects.

I'm certain that the NYT story is infinitely better because of Wade's involvement. It was a team effort, but you should know that Jimmy Mogal also was very involved. Of course, Wade wants to avoid damaging the company and your note helps to keep him up for these risky/must do requests. Along these line, I'd like to be able to give you a brief update on activities and issues. I'll check with Maureen about scheduling 15-20 minutes.

Copyright 2001 Los Angeles Times=20 --- --- ----------------------- Price Controls Spark Deja Vu=20 Energy: The specter of Richard Nixon's actions 30 years ago hangs over=20 current debate on how to check the state's surging power costs.=20 By JAMES F. PELTZ, Times Staff Writer=20 ?????A debate now rages in California over whether price controls should be= =20 adopted to stem the state's soaring power costs and help consumers who are= =20 bracing for huge spikes in their electric bills. ?????But price controls are one of the most controversial actions in=20 economics--and in politics, for that matter. And now the caps are more in= =20 dispute than ever because they run counter to the nation's move over the la= st=20 two decades to deregulate more and more industries, from airlines to=20 railroads to energy. ?????Yet California is a good example of deregulation gone haywire, so=20 controls are again being demanded by lawmakers, consumer advocates and othe= rs=20 as a way to check surging prices. On the other side is a chorus of critics= =20 who ridicule price caps as being ineffective and, at times, making matters= =20 worse for consumers. ?????Case in point: the Golden State itself, which tried last summer to use= =20 temporary price caps to keep a lid on skyrocketing wholesale electricity=20 prices. ?????Critics claim that the caps drove power sales out of state, thus=20 widening the imbalance between supply and demand, reinforcing the existing= =20 shortages and contributing to this winter's rolling blackouts. ?????But defenders of the caps note that the dysfunctional California marke= t=20 had no way to self-correct. The utilities couldn't simply refuse to buy=20 electricity in the face of higher prices, and with no price ceiling in sigh= t,=20 something had to be done. ?????And now Gov. Gray Davis and others are again calling for temporary=20 controls until more electricity supplies can be added, especially as the=20 state enters the peak-power summer season. On Tuesday, Sens. Dianne Feinste= in=20 (D-Calif.) and Gordon Smith (R-Ore.) introduced legislation that would impo= se=20 price controls on wholesale energy throughout 11 Western states. ?????Mindful of the controversial history of controls, Feinstein and Smith= =20 stressed that the caps would last only through March 1, 2003. But they also= =20 argued that the economic damage to industries and consumers from escalating= =20 power costs would exceed any harm caused by price controls. ?????""I have a strong preference for markets, but it's a mistake to believe= =20 that we have a free market when it comes to energy,"" said Smith, the only G= OP=20 co-sponsor of the legislation. ?????Their bill would require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, whi= ch=20 regulates U.S. wholesale electricity prices, either to impose a regional=20 price cap or institute a rate schedule for each power generator, tying the= =20 price of electricity to the cost of producing it. ?????Coincidentally, FERC today is expected to decide on various other=20 proposals to again limit California's power costs--but without explicitly= =20 stating that the plans include price controls. Why? Because the Bush=20 administration and FERC Chairman Curt Hebert Jr., among others, are on the= =20 record as adamantly opposing price caps. ?????That's not surprising. Price controls often are tagged as a liberal=20 maneuver that flies in the face of conservatives' free-market ideology. Yet= ,=20 ironically, hanging over the California debate is the legacy of a Republica= n=20 president who was the last one to mandate price controls on a nationwide=20 level: Richard M. Nixon. ?????The late president took that rare step 30 years ago this August to try= =20 to quell inflation and spark an economic rebound. His actions were so=20 dramatic that they are still invoked by those wanting to criticize or, in= =20 some cases, endorse setting limits on prices. ?????""What he did is almost larger than life now,"" said Shannon Burchett,= =20 chief executive of RiskLimited Corp., a strategic consulting firm in Dallas= . ?????Nixon's controls were the most far-reaching since World War II, when= =20 prices were capped so that profiteers couldn't reap huge sums for scarce=20 commodities being used for the war and simultaneously rationed at home. ?????In most cases, price controls have been much less sweeping and targete= d=20 at specific products or services. They don't always involve changing the la= w,=20 either. In 1962, President Kennedy publicly rebuked the then-U.S. Steel Cor= p.=20 and its chairman, Roger Blough, for starting an industrywide move to raise= =20 steel prices. The price hikes were rolled back a few days later. ?????Since Nixon, price controls have become rarer as industries that were= =20 once regulated--which means their prices were government-controlled--have= =20 been deregulated. ?????So it is in California, where electric utilities' prices were controll= ed=20 for decades until the state's deregulation law in 1996. But now that the la= w=20 has been blamed for the soaring wholesale prices, power shortages, crippled= =20 utilities and the need for a huge jump in ratepayers' costs, some again wan= t=20 price controls on electricity until the crisis eases. ?????Which brings everyone back to Nixon. ?????Some Nixon Controls Were Lifted by Reagan ?????""I've heard people make the analogy to what happened . . . when Nixon= =20 put on controls,"" but in California ""this is fundamentally different,"" said= =20 Mike Florio, a board member of the California Independent System Operator,= =20 which oversees most of the state's electricity grid. ?????""When you get into a situation of shortage [of supplies], there is=20 really no restraint at all on prices,"" said Florio, who said he normally=20 prefers unfettered markets but also defended the state's caps last summer.= =20 Such government intervention ""on a temporary basis is better than nothing,= =20 but I don't think it's ideal."" ?????The reverberations from Nixon's fiat aren't just felt in California=20 either. When New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani recently proposed more stringe= nt=20 controls on wholesale electricity costs in New York state, critics promptly= =20 pointed to Nixon's controls. ""They were a disaster,"" one columnist wrote. ?????Even Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who was in the private= =20 sector in the early 1970s, turned down several requests to take high-level= =20 White House jobs in part because he was disgusted with Nixon's price contro= ls. ?????Many economists and historians also judge Nixon's controls as a mistak= e.=20 But some maintain that his decision--which began with a 90-day freeze on=20 prices, wages and rents--wasn't entirely a failure and even provided ""shock= =20 value"" that, for a while at least, arrested higher inflation. ?????In addition, part of Nixon's move involved taking the dollar off the= =20 gold standard--which in effect meant its price was controlled--and letting = it=20 float in value against other major currencies. And that, many believe, is t= he=20 base upon which today's global financial markets operate. ?????Others disagree. ?????""There really isn't an example of where they've [price controls]=20 worked,"" said Robert Goldberg, a senior fellow at the National Center for= =20 Policy Analysis, a nonpartisan think tank in New York. ?????""Controls always lead to an underproduction"" of the commodity involved= =20 because producers don't have any incentive to spend more on additional=20 output, he said. When the caps ultimately are lifted, prices typically soar= =20 anyway as producers move to quickly recoup the profit they lost when the=20 controls were in place, Goldberg added. ?????Others note that although most of Nixon's price controls lasted only a= =20 couple of years, various forms of controls over crude oil and natural gas= =20 lasted for another decade until they were removed by President Ronald Reaga= n. ?????In the meantime, the controls--aggravated by embargoes and other suppl= y=20 cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries--distorted the fr= ee=20 market for energy, critics say. The controls kept U.S. oil prices=20 artificially low, which in turn kept demand for oil high, giving OPEC more= =20 power over world production and prices in the 1970s, they contend. ?????Nonetheless, proponents keep calling for controls when prices for=20 certain items seem to be spiraling out of control. ?????Critics Say Controls Worsen the Problems ?????President Clinton's massive health-reform proposal in the early 1990s= =20 included price controls on drugs. But the idea set off howls of protest fro= m=20 the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, and ultimately the entire= =20 proposal was shelved. Consumer advocates and others also demanded federal= =20 controls on rising cable TV rates in 1997 and 1998, again contending that t= he=20 cable operators were hiking prices at a much faster rate than inflation.=20 Cable firms were allowed to keep passing certain costs on to their=20 subscribers, but specific price caps weren't enacted. ?????But proponents of temporary price controls on California power emphasi= ze=20 that electricity isn't in the same category as an airplane seat, steel or= =20 other commodities that don't have to be bought if the price soars too high. ?????""In soybeans maybe the market can adjust quickly"" to changes in supply= =20 and demand, ""but in electric generation in California it can't,"" said Flori= o,=20 who also serves as an attorney for the Utility Reform Network, a consumer= =20 group. ""For most products, one of the ways prices get determined is if buye= rs=20 refuse to buy when the price gets too high.

And those living downwind are subjected to twice as much= =20 air pollution as before California's energy crunch. ?????Not every Glendale resident is happy. ?????""You don't want anyone to get stuck with a rolling blackout, but we ge= t=20 struck with the pollution,"" Jerold Petrosian said as he and his family boug= ht=20 plants at a nursery across the street from the power plant. ""It is a tough= =20 decision."" ?????Not so for Ignacio Troncoso, director of Glendale Water & Power. ""Ther= e=20 is a pretty decent trade-off, helping our neighbors in the state to keep=20 their lights on,"" he said. ?????A USC specialist warned that increased power plant emissions raise the= =20 risks of asthma and other lung ailments in the young and old. ?????""There is a potential for more emergency room visits, more people seei= ng=20 their doctors and more hospitalizations this summer,"" said Dr. Henry Gong,= =20 professor of medicine and a specialist in the health effects of air polluti= on. ?????With extended hours, the Glendale generators are emitting as much as 9= 95=20 pounds of pollutants into the air during peak demand, more than double the= =20 old limit of 390 pounds a day, city and air-quality officials said. ?????The other 14 power plants in Southern California also have more than= =20 doubled their overall emissions, according to preliminary figures from the= =20 South Coast Air Quality Management District. As a group, the plants emitted= a=20 total of 2,045 tons of smog-forming nitrogen oxide in the first three month= s=20 of 2001, compared with 905 tons for the same period last year. ?????The AQMD hearing board on Tuesday eased pollution controls so Glendale= =20 may continue to generate excess electricity for sale to the energy-starved= =20 state. Under the plan, Glendale may run three of its old steam boilers=20 around-the-clock to meet the state's energy demand. Usually, these boilers,= =20 hidden behind a tall brick wall, sit idle except during the peak summer=20 demand because they are inefficient and costly. ?????Glendale, like Burbank and the Los Angeles Department of Water and=20 Power, continues to produce electricity at its city-owned plant. The three= =20 cities opted against participating in a scheme of deregulation, a decision= =20 that has shielded their residents, by and large, from the huge utility rate= =20 hikes and rolling power outages experienced elsewhere. But they also will= =20 contribute to easing the state's energy emergency in the dirtier air they= =20 will be forced to breathe. ?????Air-quality officials said power plants contribute just about 3% of th= e=20 900 tons of pollution emitted into the air daily, with about 70% of the=20 pollution coming from vehicles, not factories. And in recent years, many of= =20 the region's municipal power generators have been updated with=20 pollution-control devices that reduce emissions. ?????Glendale's three steam generators, built between 1953 and 1963, are=20 inefficient by today's standards, but they are 85% cleaner since the city= =20 pumped millions of dollars into upgrades. They will be even cleaner, city= =20 officials say, with more retrofitting. ?????Under the plan, Glendale must reinvest profits from energy sales,=20 estimated at $3 million to $5 million this year, in equipment to reduce=20 future emissions at the plant and in community-based programs, such as mobi= le=20 asthma clinics and programs to reduce school bus emissions. ?????The city plans to sell as much as 50 megawatts of power, enough to ser= ve=20 50,000 homes. Under the decision Tuesday, pollution limits resume Jan. 1,= =20 2002, or when the energy emergency ends. ?????In Los Angeles, power officials said they don't expect to exceed AQMD= =20 caps, because they are adding pollution controls at two of the city's four= =20 power plants. Although they will produce more electricity, they should not= =20 produce any more nitrogen oxide, which in sunlight and heat form ozone, sai= d=20 Angelina Galiteva, LADWP's director of strategic planning. ?????""We will have much cleaner equipment in place by June,"" she said. ?????Even the environmentalists are trying to balance the risks. ?????""We realize we have a problem this summer. We have to run these plants= ,""=20 said Sheryl Carter, a senior policy analyst for the National Resources=20 Defense Council. ?????Carter said natural-gas-powered generators, like the ones in Glendale,= =20 are ""a far superior solution to diesel generators,"" which produce 50 to 100= =20 times the emissions and would be turned on in businesses across the state i= f=20 energy is unavailable from other sources. ?????""We are trying to make sure the environment overall is made whole,"" sh= e=20 said. ?????Carl Zichella, regional staff director for the Sierra Club, said the= =20 generators should be run as a last resort. He also urged consumers to unplu= g=20 spare refrigerators and use energy-efficient light bulbs to reduce the=20 state's overall energy demand. ?????""The only thing that is going to work to offset air pollution is=20 efficiency,"" he said. Otherwise, ""we will pay not only with higher rates bu= t=20 also with our health."" ?????In neighboring Burbank, city officials are preparing for peak summer= =20 energy demands, when they expect to sell about 10% of their locally produce= d=20 electricity outside the city. ?????""For four or five years, we have been polluting Utah, Arizona, Nevada,= =20 Washington and Oregon, importing power to Los Angeles,"" said Ron Davis,=20 general manager of Burbank Water & Power, listing the energy-producing stat= es=20 that typically produce the bulk of Southern California's power. ""We are=20 returning the favor."" ?????Profits from those outside sales, Davis said, will help hold down=20 utility costs for local users. ?????""I think most people would take a little more smog to guarantee there= =20 are no rolling blackouts,"" he said.

Copyright 2001 Los Angeles Times=20 --- --- ---------- Power Plant Plan Worries Neighbors=20 Energy crisis: Regulators will decide next week whether to allow Huntington= =20 Beach facility to boost output. Noise and pollution are concerns.=20 By CHRISTINE HANLEY, Times Staff Writer=20 ?????On Hula Circle in Huntington Beach, families have tried to live with= =20 their two very different neighbors. They live steps from the Pacific Ocean= =20 but next door to the mechanical shrieks and foul smells of the massive AES= =20 Corp. power plant. ?????But California's power crisis is rapidly unhinging life in the=20 neighborhood of ranch houses and bungalows. ?????State regulators will decide next week whether to allow the company to= =20 double the plant's operations by July, providing much-needed electricity bu= t=20 taking what residents fear will be a heavy toll on them. ?????It's one of several proposals to restart or build new power plants in= =20 the wake of the power crisis using a ""fast track"" process that allows the= =20 projects to go forward before environmental and pollution studies are=20 completed. ?????""The plant is so close. We want to know if it is impacting our kids in= =20 ways we won't know about until 10 years from now,"" said Janette Mortimer, w= ho=20 lives with her husband and their two young children in one of the homes=20 closest to the plant. ?????Already, residents say, the AES plant is casting a mightier shadow.=20 There are the ear-ringing rumbles and roars. There are the mysterious plume= s=20 of smoke that waft over the neighborhood. Then there is the grime that seem= s=20 never to go away. ?????If the California Energy Commission approves the permit for AES, the= =20 facility could run at full capacity for the first time in memory. Officials= =20 said the plant's previous owner, Southern California Edison, typically ran = it=20 at 30% of capacity. ?????AES could be allowed to run the four gas-fired boilers and a ""peaker""= =20 unit whenever California hits a Stage 3 alert--which is expected to happen= =20 often this summer. The ""peaker"" plant alone is powered by eight jet=20 engines--and sounds like it. ?????Currently, only two boilers are operating. ?????But residents say they are most worried about the air they breathe and= =20 the water they swim in. ?????Under the fast-tracking process designed to get more electricity for t= he=20 state as soon as possible, several key environmental questions have yet to = be=20 studied. ?????Scientists studying the cause of ocean pollution that closed much of= =20 Huntington Beach's shoreline in the summer of 1999 said that the plant, alo= ng=20 with other factors, played a role by drawing partially treated sewage that = is=20 discharged miles offshore back toward the coast. ?????AES Inc. will pay $1.5 million to further study the issue, but the=20 research won't be complete for some time. ?????""So much is uncertain,"" said Huntington Beach Councilwoman Shirley=20 Dettloff. ""These are big, big things."" ?????For now, residents say they are bracing for more noise, smoke and=20 disruption. ?????To begin with, AES' proposal calls for 20 hours a day of nonstop=20 construction to get the two mothballed generators in service by July. ?????Then there are the sizzling summer temperatures. Residents usually ope= n=20 their windows to let the ocean breezes cool their homes. But the noise and= =20 smells from the plants may make that impossible. ?????""It's going to be bad. There's no escape,"" said Bryan Visnoski. ?????The plant has towered over the Huntington Beach coastline for nearly 4= 0=20 years. The housing tracts came later, but most inhabitants of Hula Circle a= nd=20 surrounding streets seemed to make peace with their industrial neighbor. ?????Some have installed double-paned windows to dampen the sound. Others= =20 have remodeled their homes to obstruct ugly views. The Mortimers grew tall= =20 trees and trained vines past the windows. ?????The problems, they say, began with the energy crisis. ?????The plant was owned by Edison until 1998, when it was sold to=20 AES--California's largest private electricity producer--at the dawn of=20 deregulation. ?????The two gas-fired boilers that AES wants to restart have been dormant= =20 since 1995 and were slated for demolition until the power crisis struck. ?????But a few months ago as rolling blackouts hit the state, Gov. Gray Dav= is=20 signed an executive order allowing ""peaker plants"" to operate at extended= =20 hours. ""Peaker plants"" can produce electricity in quick bursts but guzzle= =20 large amounts of natural gas and are noisy. ?????Hulu Circle residents said the order has resulted in more hours of lou= d=20 jet noises that make then feel like they live by an airport. ?????Whenever the peaker plant goes on, residents call the Air Quality=20 Management District to send someone to test the plume of smoke. The=20 inspections have not detected any violations. ?????The proposal before the state Energy Commission would allow AES to=20 double its electricity output in Huntington Beach from 500 megawatts to 1,0= 00=20 megawatts. ?????The company's two 40-year-old units represent about 10% of the 5,000= =20 additional megawatts Davis has promised to meet an expected energy shortfal= l=20 this summer. ?????Despite the fast-tracking process, the company has vowed that it would= =20 safeguard against environmental damage and remedy any problems from plant= =20 operations. ?????If the plant is identified as drawing bacteria back to shore, AES woul= d=20 have to pay the costs deemed necessary to fix problems. ?????This is little consolation to residents, who would prefer a full=20 environmental review.

Gray Davis on energy issues=20 Gov. Gray Davis visited the Mercury News editorial board Monday. On the=20 subject of electricity, Davis talked about increasing the number of power= =20 plants, the rejection of price caps by the Federal Energy Regulatory=20 Commission, and the condition of the state's two largest utilities, Souther= n=20 California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric. Davis has proposed a deal to= =20 rescue Edison, and the Legislature is considering it. PG&E has filed for=20 bankruptcy.=20 Here is a condensed version of Davis' remarks.=20 Q: What would you like to say by way of introduction about the state's=20 electricity problems?=20 Davis: There are really two problems. One is the amount of power available= =20 and the other is the price of power.=20 In 2002, we'll have more megawatts on line, at least 5,000 more. By 2003,= =20 we'll have a slight excess of power over demand. That's very important.=20 Because at the moment, we import 20 percent of our power. We have no=20 leverage. We are at the mercy of forces that show no mercy. That will never= =20 change until we have more power than we need.=20 OK, price. As you know, the only entity that can influence the [wholesale]= =20 price of electricity is the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.=20 Deregulation surrendered the ability of the state to do that.=20 In 1999, this state for all power, including municipal power, spent roughly= =20 $7 billion. In 2000, we spent $32.5 billion. I don't know what it will be= =20 this year, but it will be substantially higher.=20 Through all this the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has refused to do= a=20 thing, zero, zippo. Lest you think I'm being partisan, that commission=20 consists entirely of Clinton appointees.=20 The final piece is the financial consequences of what's happened to date. I= t=20 is our hope that if we can keep Southern California Edison credit-worthy an= d=20 able to re-enter the power purchasing market Jan. 1, 2003, we can then go t= o=20 the PG&E creditors committee [the generators to whom PG&E owes money] and s= ay=20 to them: ``Look at the arrangement we made with Southern California Edison.= =20 We believe that this is a far better deal than PG&E can give you.''=20 I think this is a fair plan. We get every electron that Edison's utility ow= ns=20 committed for 10 years, at a cost-of-service basis. Under [current law] the= y=20 could sell that next March at market rates. We got $400 million returned fr= om=20 the holding company, a $3 billion investment in the transmission and delive= ry=20 systems .?.?. a permanent easement on about 20,000 acres of environmental= =20 property around all their hydro facilities.=20 Q: Do you have in mind a finished product for the changes that are happenin= g=20 in the electric system? What will it look like in a couple of years?=20 Davis: It is my expectation that the utilities will be purchasing the power= =20 entirely, commencing Jan. 1, 2003. Our goal is to get them back in business= .=20 In addition to investor-owned utilities, I believe we also need a public=20 power authority. At some point I believe the private sector will say to=20 itself, ``I want to build new plants to replace the 40-year-old plants, but= =20 do I really want to get the state to a 15 percent margin over supply, there= by=20 reducing the value of the electrons I already own?'' If they do, God bless= =20 them. But if they don't, at least we'll have the opportunity to build them= =20 ourselves.=20 Once we have even a slight margin of capacity over demand, the spot market= =20 prices will come down dramatically.=20 Q: You said in February that you could have solved the electricity problem = in=20 20 minutes if you'd been willing to raise rates. Now, rates are going to be= =20 raised. Should you have favored a rate increase earlier?=20 Davis: I should have been more specific. I should have said I could have=20 solved it in 20 minutes if I wanted to triple rates. I think the rate=20 increase I proposed is fair. It rewards people who are the most energy=20 efficient, the people who only use up to 130 percent of their baseline. The= y=20 are approximately half the state. So half the state will see no rate=20 increase, beyond the 10 percent that everyone saw in January.=20 Q: Is the state willing to spend anything it costs to keep the lights on, o= r=20 at some point, would it stiff the generators and just say we will accept a= =20 blackout?=20 Davis: We have to provide power. There are many people who have medical=20 devices that have to keep running. Blackouts can cause deaths, traffic=20 accidents, all kinds of calamities that I wouldn't want to happen.=20 I'm reluctant to tell the generators we'll pay any price, so I'm not going = to=20 say we'll pay absolutely any price, but my bias obviously is to find a way = to=20 keep the lights on.=20 Q: When will you reveal how much electricity the state has bought, from wha= t=20 companies, at what prices and what this will cost the state this year and i= n=20 coming years?=20 Davis: We'll reveal an awful lot of information as soon as the bonds go to= =20 market. [The state plans a bond issue to cover the upfront costs of=20 purchasing electricity.] That information has to be made public. That will= =20 probably be in less than two months.=20 Believe me, I don't like going around getting beat up for hiding informatio= n.=20 I'm doing it for one reason only, which is that I know every additional edg= e=20 I give the generators will result in higher prices for customers.=20 Q: There's an impression that the state budget is being drained by the powe= r=20 crisis. Is that right?=20 Davis: The simple answer to that is no, because the state will be fully=20 reimbursed with interest as soon as these bonds are sold.=20 At the moment, in the short term, it is crowding out other spending. But I= =20 think everyone understands that's a temporary phenomenon, until the state i= s=20 reimbursed by bonds that are repaid over time through the rate structure th= at=20 I proposed.=20 Q: Would it be your pledge that ratepayers, not taxpayers, will fully repay= =20 the state's cost in purchasing electricity?=20 Davis: That is the assumption underlying these bonds. That's right as it=20 relates to electricity, but obviously the conservation incentives came out = of=20 the general fund.=20 Q: Have you talked to President Bush about this?=20 Davis: I hear all these rumors as to why the Bush administration doesn't wa= nt=20 to be helpful, but this state, and particularly this region, has been=20 disproportionately helpful in America's economic growth and technological= =20 productivity. If he wants America to grow, it behooves him to keep Californ= ia=20 growing.

""The implications for the development of competitive energy markets go far beyond the Western United States,"" Andersen's national utility practice head Matthew D. Smith told a Washington briefing. ""Unfortunately, California has taught the nation that regulatory and political barriers can create and sustain an energy crisis."" ""California has demonstrated that the risks in the electricity industry, if not properly acknowledged and managed, can simultaneously and profoundly impact all market participants. To be effectively managed, these risks need to be exposed, assumed or shared, measured and monitored. When they are hidden or ignored, all parties can potentially suffer. A shared, integrated view of these risks, and a strategy for their assumption and management, is critical to avoiding rapid value destruction within the energy market,"" Smith said. An Andersen survey of senior utility executives outside California, also released at the briefing, indicates most utility companies believe they inoculated themselves against the California virus so that it is unlikely to affect their operations beyond slowing the pace of deregulation and increasing investor scrutiny. However, based on the potential implications it sees of the California situation, Andersen believes a series of booster shots are advisable for power companies and regulators. ""To deliver reliable service at a predictable cost in today's environment, companies must focus on market integration by developing new and innovative relationships between suppliers, customers, employees and investors -- while working with government officials and regulators to chart a smoother transition to a deregulated power market,"" according to Smith. Eight Implications The Andersen report identified eight overriding implications emanating from the Western energy crisis that are shaping the longer-term operations of the Western grid, the regional and national economy, domestic energy policy and the industry's evolution: 1. Increased deregulation uncertainty and risk -- Tension and differences between state and federal regulators raise the specter of repeating the regulatory and political conundrum California's investor-owned utilities have faced. If federal initiatives open wholesale markets while retail markets remain regulated, a crucial question is raised: Will state regulators pass-through higher wholesale costs if they should materialize? Tensions between state and federal regulators over policies on deregulation will grow if states delay or abandon retail competition. As wholesale markets are deregulated and RTOs begin operating, the prudence principles that state regulators have used for many years may have to be changed. For example, if FERC and RTO monitors determine that deregulated wholesale markets operate fairly, prices derived from those markets must be considered reasonable. If so, these costs should be allowed into state-regulated retail rates without regard to the prudence principles state regulators have used for years. Therefore, utilities' traditional burden of proving costs are or are not justifiable shifts to regulators. 2. Reduced investor confidence -- Prior to deregulation, stringent prudence review and disallowance of generation costs in the rate base made regulatory risk largely uncontrollable, killing IOU interests in most new investment. A major purpose of deregulation was to create an environment in which risk could be managed, but California's political and regulatory environment provides only a limited ability to manage risks. The confidence and perceptions needed to support investment decision-making will be slow to return given the approach of the state to remedy the crisis. 3. Contributing factor in economic softening -- Uncertain energy reliability and higher costs can drive-out marginal businesses, cause healthy companies to constrain expansion, and lead new entrants to question whether to make new investments. As such, an extended energy crisis contributes to inflation pressures and may slow economic growth. 4. Increased pressure on the Western grid -- Even as capacity increases and demand reductions work to resolve the California crisis, these solutions have long-term implications for the Western Grid. These include a realistic possibility of California becoming an ""energy island"" as a result of near-term reduction in available regional resources for export to California; increased emphasis on security control to protect against overall Western grid failure as sub-regions have problems; RTO requirements to strengthen locally available supplies to bolster overall system reliability; longer-term development of new plants using plentiful coal resources and clean coal technology will alter the pattern of imports into California; and the emergence of Mexico as a major supplier to southern California and Arizona, contributing to a bifurcation of the Western Grid into northern and southern markets. 5. Unbundling failures that push companies back to portfolio strategies -- For California investor-owned utilities, unbundling has achieved neither the least-cost solution sought by regulators nor value maximization targeted by investors. This necessitates a reevaluation of portfolio management strategies potentially involving generation, transmission, power trading and marketing, and retail businesses in multiple geographies serving multiple markets. 6. Ineffectiveness in changing siting and development restrictions -- California's retail price caps and multiple explanations for the crisis have left accelerated siting processes and environmental standards changes open to challenge by various interests. In addition, limiting application of new siting orders only to small generators contributes to uncertainty and investor hesitancy. 7. Procurement management that alters user-utility negotiating leverage -- Competitive markets compel participants -- suppliers, marketers, large industrial buyers, etc. -- to strategically manage procurement as a critical value-driver. Because risk is explicitly shared and always has the potential of shifting advantage to either seller or buyer, the sophistication of negotiations and contracts increases as competitive markets evolve. 8. Increased emphasis on distributed generation and new technologies -- California's reliability and price challenges have triggered a re-emergence of energy crisis measures from the 1970s. End-users are investing in solutions they control, and the distributed generation market is being aggressively developed among large retailers, industrial users and residential customers. This makes possible the development of microgrids connecting consumers in local areas and related changes in traditional grid systems, from modifications in interconnection agreements to changing definitions of reserve margins and system reliability. Industry Executives' Response Senior executives from sixteen non-California utilities with a combined market capitalization over $120 billion and $145 billion in revenues responded to an Andersen survey with their views of the implications of the California power crisis for their companies and for the industry. The survey, conducted between February 19, 2001 and March 2, 2001 by Knowledge Systems &amp; Research, Inc. of Syracuse, found that the companies are observing the California situation carefully, expect a slowing -- but not a turnaround -- of deregulation, and believe their internal plans and preparations are on-target for the changing environment: -- Deregulation -- Nearly all executives believe recent California events will slow the pace of deregulation over the next five years for states that have not begun or finished writing restructuring legislation. None believe that it will cause advanced states to re-regulate markets, although many states will review their legislation to assess their risk of duplicating California's current situation and make any changes necessary to avoid it. -- National legislation -- Few executives suggest the situation will initiate national energy policy/legislation; others believe it will be a continuing issue but, because of state-to-state variances, Congress will be unable to pass any comprehensive measures or force states to a restructuring timeline. Some expect additional state-level legislation. -- Company strategies -- Most do not see any changes to their business models or strategies for generation, distribution or supply procurement as a response to the situation in California. However, many have expanded their risk management programs, reduced spot market purchases, begun emphasizing long-term supply contracts, planning new power generation capacity, and started hedging with futures trades. Those facing price caps are rethinking their stance on them. -- Investor scrutiny -- Many executives indicate their shareholders are aware of the situation and investors -- particularly institutional investors -- are more heavily scrutinizing their actions. Many say news coverage has prompted retail, commercial and industrial customer skepticism of industry restructuring. -- Transmission deregulation -- Many executives agree the California situation will increase interest in FERC's regional transmission organizations (RTO) deregulation effort. Utility Company Action Items Both to guard against a sudden California cascade and as a potentially powerful competitive thrust, forward-thinking utilities should bolster their basic preparedness with a variety of tactics -- or inoculations -- specifically aimed to combat a potential California power virus, according to Andersen partner Mark Moskovitz: -- Improve procurement management and risk management capabilities -- To manage exposure to volatile supply and demand shifts, organizations must be sure that comprehensive and clear supply procedures, controls, decision points, risk limits and communications are in place. -- Plan and design innovative rate and pricing structures -- Companies and regulators must focus on communicating price signals that create value for both the customer and the provider. Innovative rate and pricing structures that more closely tie the customer's price to the real cost of supply will better signal the value of the service as well as providing more accurate information upon which both end user and supplier can make decisions. -- Increase emphasis on demand side management (DSM) strategies -- In addition to new pricing strategies to help achieve and maintain supply-demand equilibrium, companies must now focus on employing more extensive and innovative demand side management programs. These programs may offer significant benefits with limited risk to both the customer and energy supplier. -- Assess the supply and generation dynamics in adjacent jurisdictions -- Companies must take a broader view -- beyond typical geographic market definitions -- of the economics of generation and related business decisions in an increasingly volatile market in which supply will follow the best prices. -- Develop contingency plans for the continued deferral of new generation capacity -- In the face of potential ongoing generation capacity shortages, companies and regulators must be prepared to move with a portfolio of strategies to meet demand, including for example DSM, flexible pricing and distributed generation. In addition, they should explore efficiency-improving upgrades to existing facilities and seize any opportunity to accelerate near-term construction plans. -- Proactively address potential organizational disruption -- As regulatory and economic changes continue to churn the industry waters and companies adjust and/or restructure, they must be highly cogniscent of, sensitive to, and directly address employees' concerns with information about the company's future and theirs'. Industry/Regulatory Lessons There are also a number of broad primary lessons the electric power industry -- nationally and internationally -- should take away from its first major domestic test case in deregulation and restructuring, according to Andersen principal David O. Jermain: -- Simplify market design. -- Build a continuing role for regulators. -- Maintain communications with multiple constituent interests. -- Prepare contingency plans for extreme stress conditions. -- Couple real-time retail pricing with transparently priced wholesale competition. -- Provide special incentives for RTO investment, formation and development. -- Break down regulatory and political barriers to market signals and responses.

The first warm spell of the season is expected to cause temperatures to jump 10 degrees, leading to a 2,000 megawatt increase in electricity consumption -- the equivalent of two large power plants. The week started out with a peak demand of 28,835 megawatts, but by tomorrow it is forecasted to top 30,500 megawatts. This comes as hydroelectricity resources (both Northwest and California) run low, more than 10,000 megawatts of power plants remain off line due to planned and unplanned maintenance, and some 3,000 megawatts of Qualifying Facilities or alternative energy suppliers are not operating. The California ISO's renewed call for conservation precedes a forecast of 90 degree highs in the inland areas that may tempt many Californians to flip on air conditioners. For conservation tips -- such as using fans instead of air conditioners, setting thermostat at 78 degrees, etc. -- please see the California ISO's web site www.caiso.com. New Notification System: With a challenging summer around the corner, the California ISO wants to do all it can to bring information to the public as quickly as possible. For that reason, a new notification system is being brought on line. Media and the public can now access the Internet to keep current if rotating blackouts are issued. Navigation: Visit www.caiso.com Click on System Conditions for current information on rotating outages (will appear only when activated) For previous outage information (last hour, etc.), click on Market Notices, scroll to bottom of page and click on Notice Log The California ISO is also testing a new service to notify newsrooms immediately by email should the ISO initiate electrical emergencies (Stage One - Three) or rotating outages. If you would like to participate, please email kwerst@caiso.com with a maximum of one email address per newsroom. Additionally, a single on-call media pager number has been established: 916/815-0679. To make it easier on media, ISO Communications will no longer be posting on-call schedules for media spokespersons on the web site. Simply call the on-call pager after hours. News releases alerting the media to electrical emergencies will continue, as will news conferences held on-site in Folsom and via telephone. As a reminder, if you wish to visit the ISO control rooms (in Folsom or Alhambra) always call ISO Communications first at 888/516-NEWS to make an appointment. Access to the control rooms may be limited on certain days, depending on system conditions and/or level of requests from media.

Subject:: RTO Meeting With Chairman Barton
Body:: Late yesterday afternoon, EPSA's legislative affairs committee (about 10 of us) met with Chairman Barton and staff to discuss his draft RTO language. Meeting lasted 45 minutes. Interestingly, no one was there from either Reliant or El Paso. We had what the diplomats would call a frank exchange of views. Can't say we moved Barton very much, if at all, except we did have a chance to ""go over the staff"" to point out specific flaws in the draft even based on his view of how RTOs should come about (I gave several very specific examples like the 40,000 MW provision and other limits on FERC discretion on size and scope, as well as procedural rights for transmission owners but not the rest of us, etc.). Chairman Barton's fundamental view is that Congress, not FERC, should determine how RTOs come about. And that ""the market"" and ""the industry"" should determine how RTOs are shaped, etc., not FERC. He bristled at one point and said he had more faith in ""us"" than he had in FERC or we had in ourselves to determine how RTOs come about, going so far as to saying that under his draft they would be ""our"" RTOs -- meaning those of us present. I pointed out this is wrong because under his draft the transmission owners, particularly those least likely to join up, would have all the leverage. I said that the basic flaw in the draft is that it assumes there are only two parties to the transaction -- FERC and transmission owners -- forgetting the rest of us, including consumers. He said we could become transmission owners if we wanted to!!! On the 40,000 MW size minimum, he said many ""experts"" had advised them this is the correct number. We said that putting a number in to the statute ran counter to his oft-stated desire for a fair process to produce RTOs driven by market forces, not regulators. The two elements of good news -- Barton reconfirmed that a markup this year is very unlikely AND he expressed that he would not spend too much time on electricity next year if it started to crowd out other issues, like Clean Air Act Amendments and nuclear waste legislation. This suggests a strategy possibility in terms of running out the clock. He said he has the votes by a wide margin to report the RTO draft, but will entertain some changes. He said the only reason he has not marked up the bill is that the Sept. 11th terrorist attacks have taken attention away from the issue and subcommittee members are not engaged on the issue. He said those of us who support could roll the dice with them, but that there are things that only Congress can do -- like getting all transmission owners into RTOs -- and that these statutory changes are so important that we should not oppose the draft.

I very much enjoyed meeting with you and your message, that your Chairman Kenneth Lay confirmed for dinner with our Mayor Petra Roth was very well received and we are all very excited and looking forward to November 30. However it raises great interest in the question of organization of the dinner and the additional participating chairpeople of other companies. Wil= l Enron now invite for that dinner, which I understand will be the gathering of 10-12 major decision makers in the energy field? If you could be so kind as to share with us the thoughts of Ken Lay=01%s office with regards to tha= t point, or give me a contact there, I would very much appreciate. An alternative we discussed or as an addition the next day (Lunch), would b= e that a business-group would host an event, which could include a wider audience of business people of Houston. After having spoken with the Germa= n Consulate in Houston and with the German American Chamber here, it unfortunately appears as if they will not be capable for s.th. we achieve. Everybody recommended to work with the reputative Greater Houston Partnership, whose President was on vacation last week. I would welcome an= y assistance in getting us in contact with them. Probably it would not take too many efforts for Enron, to have them consider supporting out idea of promoting our ideas. To help you pass them, I again include our plan for Houston (see attached doc). I will be in contact with your colleague Mark Palmer with regards to the press-coverage. Thank you for your response to your earliest possible convenience.

The document is still too rough to send out. We need to take the opportunity, as soon as possible, to get a hard hitting, thoroughly researched and carefully written document in front of the Commissioners. California's reaction to the Judge's recommendation is likely to give FERC (especially the new commissioners) a feel for how irrational the California politicians can be. We will have a limited opportunity to take advantage of that realization. We need to hit it hard in the pleading, our conversations at the Commission, the Hill and the media.

NECUPUC supports the request for the release of the unredacted copies of ISO-NE's September 21, 2000 Answer in this case. In the alternative, they would ask that the Commission provide to the regulators that are parties to the proceeding unredacted copies of the ISO's September 21, 2000 Answer subject to an appropriate protective order. Duke Energy North America (DENA) filed an Answer that opposes the MPUC request for public information. DENA argues that only a three month lag in the release of confidential information is impermissible under a prior FERC ruling in the NSTAR Services Co. case which set out a six-month lag rule for the release of information. Their second argument was that the request seeks information for all NEPOOL markets and not just the ICAP market which is subject to the suit. If the FERC authorizes the release of confidential information, then it should be subject to a protective order which contains the following: The information may only be used for the purposes of this docket. Only specifically named ""reviewing Reps associated with the MPUC may review the information. The confidential materials may not be removed from the NE-ISO's premises. The reviewing rep must execute a nondisclosure certificate. Answer to the MPUC's Motion for Disclosure of Information from Northeast Utilities Service Company and Select Energy and request for expedited commission action. NUSCO and Select Energy Support MPUC's request for disclosure of information that the ISO has filed under seal, but opposes the selective disclosure of this information to the MPUC and other regulatory commissions and not other participants. NUSCO and Select Energy request expedited action due the financial implications and there is also considerable uncertainty regarding prices in the residual ICAP market in January, February and March of 2000 due to the suspended settlement pending Commission guidance.

Michelle ---------------------- Forwarded by Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT on 11/01/2000 07:48 PM --------------------------- HThomas@gspcorp.com on 11/01/2000 07:19:00 PM To: michelle.cash@enron.com, david.oxley@enron.com, peter.del.vecchio@enron.com cc: david.howe@enron.com, fran.mayes@enron.com Subject: Privileged and Confidential communication to my attorneys Michelle and Peter, we (GSP) have determined that we are not a federal government contractor. Based on feedback from GSP employees, we do sell newsprint to printers who print material for the federal government, but we are a 'second-tier' contractor, not a 'first-tier' contractor. (Pat McCarthy, the local employment law attorney that I have been using, used these terms when David Howe and i talked to him today.) Pat informed us that second-tier contractors do not have to abide by all the federal government requirements for contractors. Based on this, GSP does not plan to file EEO-1 reports or prepare affirmative action plans. In addition, we do not feel that we are subject to an OFCCP audit. Michelle, since you left me the voicemail telling me that we are not included in the Enron EEO-1, i assume that also means that Enron's status as a government contractor does not force us to prepare EEO-1 and AAPs. Please advise us if you feel we have made incorrect assumptions on any of this. Hoyt

In addition, we are presently trying to schedule you with Senators Lieberman, Landrieu, Hagel, Domenici, Johnson, and Cantwell. You will be here at a very important time. In addition, Ken Lay is slated to be in New York on June 15. We are trying to get appointments for him with Senator Schumer and Rep. Rangel. If we are unsuccessful in lining up anything for him in NY, we have ""penciled in"" Ken on Chairman Bingaman's calendar for 10:30 am that day, here in DC. Ken is in NY Thursday night for an award, and I understand is planning to be in NY Friday night, but his calendar at present is clear during the day. If we don't get the Schumer appointment in NY, I will being asking you to see if Ken is willing to make a quick trip during the day on Friday to DC to see Bingaman and, if we can get him, Leader Daschle. I think it would be worth a quick trip from NY and will still allow him to be in NY that night.

Subject:: FW: Bingaman Draft On Transparency -- Amendment Ideas
Body:: Louise -- LIsa Yoho suggested I forward the attached e-mail from yesterday on a conversation Linda Robertson and I had on the transparency issue. My apologies for not including you on the original distribution list, as I should have done. Your comments are most welcome. John Shelk -----Original Message----- From: Shelk, John Sent: Tuesday, September 11, 2001 9:51 AM To: Robertson, Linda; Long, Chris; Shapiro, Richard; Yoho, Lisa; Briggs, Tom; Nicolay, Christi L.; Steffes, James D. Subject: Bingaman Draft On Transparency -- Amendment Ideas Last night, Linda and I spent a fairly long time with Leon Lowery, Chairman Bingaman's chief electricity advisor, to discuss our concerns with the transparency and market-based rate language -- while at the same time commending the transmission access language in the draft and strategizing how to support the chairman in that regard. We made progress on transparency, less so on market-based rates. On transparency, Leon understands our concerns. In a nutshell, he seemed amenable to amending the langauge to avoid the result of having to divulge transaction-specific, trade-specific information. We persuaded Leon that was the impact of the initial language, although he initially said details would be left to FERC. We persuaded him that if any data is to be provided, it MUST be only in aggregate form. We also impressed on him that if, as he said, the intent is to leave details to FERC -- then more of the details should be left to FERC, not set by statute. Leon strongly advised that we seek to craft language consistent with the above exchange that makes as few changes to the draft as needed to make the necessary corrections. This will make it easier for Leon to navigate the internal waters of the staff. (Sam Fowler, th chief counsel, is a drafting stickler). Others should obviously weigh in and review this, but to facilitate internal comments (we need to get back to Leon today), here is my take on what he has in mind. Under new sec. 218(b) (to be added to the FPA by bill sec. 413) (pg. 13), under ""information required"" we would rewrite paragraph 2 as follows: (2) each broker, exchange, or other market-making entity that matches offers to sell and offers to buy wholesale electric energy in interstate commerce to provide aggregate statistical information about its sales of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce. The effect of the language change is drop the reference to sale prices of each sale of electric energy. By leaving it as aggregate statistical information, this should give FERC maximum flexibility to permit indexes, etc. As to the ""timely basis"" of information release (subsection (c)), the alternatives sent yesterday would require this to be done on the Internet after the end of the trading day. If we can restrict this to aggregate data, question arises whether we want to concede that this would be done daily. That suggests the data to be collected would be more than we would want, I think. Here is a take on how we might suggest a revision to that language to give FERC more leeway: ""(c) TIMELY BASIS -- The Commission shall require the information required under subsection (b) to be posted on the Internet and updated as frequently as practicable and appropriate. The change is to add ""appropriate"" so that FERC can consider other than whether posting is practicable. The use of ""appropriate"" is what came to mind -- perhaps there is some other word or phrase like ""consistent with ..."" or ""promote competition"" or some way of saying there are policy considerations other than practicability. There should be some valid purpose established before data is released. I would argue that the (d) language on commercially sensitive information goes only to exempting from disclosure, not when disclosure is appropriate. Please let me have your thoughts, although the tragedy in NYC and DC now underway will probably make this not a day to transact such business on the Hill. Will provide a further report on market-based rates. In sum, Leon was not as sympathetic on this issue, but asked for our ideas and further arguments. We sense Leon personally feels strongly about moving the FPA to some linkage to competitive markets. His argument is that market participants can be doing everything by the book and the result can still be uncompetitive markets. We pushed that penalizing us is not the answer -- nor is increasing regulatory uncertainty about deals doing to help keep prices down. Leon clearly does not intend this language to punish Enron -- but others who we might all agree have done things that are not in keeping with competitive markets.

Cc: Belden, Tim; Steffes, James D.; Sanders, Richard B.; Robertson, Linda Subject: California Refund Proceeding--Got some exhibits to prepare--Confidential Atty Client Work Product I met with Gary Fergus and we determined the need to prepare affidavits and/or exhibits as part of our August 15th showing in the Califronia refund case. Exhbits in a FERC case require supporting documents and a sponsor (witness). I am trying to contact various people on getting the data together but here are the parameters of the exhibits: Witness designations are preliminary. 1. EPMI's receivables from ISO/PX What it shows: ISO owes us $41.5 million and the PX $9.1 million plus any claims we want to make w.r.t. letters of credit with the PX Sponsor: Tracy Ngo (PX data) and Murray O'Neil (ISO data) (Tracy has agreed to prepare the exhibit but wants support from Murray's group on the ISO numbers.) 2. EPMI's ""receivables"" from ISO for the underscheduling penalty What it shows: ISO has yet to actually implement the underscheduling penalty but has been tracking it. According to information provided Chris Stockly, EPMI would receive $30 million of penalty revenues Sponsor: Chris Stokley or Murray O'Neil 3. Enron's PX credit receivables What it shows: PG&E and SCE collectively owe EES $500 million Sponsor: Steve Swain or ?? GAC

Body:: Ken Lay spoke with several California CEOs this morning and urged them to get personally involved in pushing for a comprehensive set of reforms. Three expressed willingness to help. Scott McNealy (Sun): contact person - Piper Cole (piper.cole@sun.com); scott.mcnealy@engeng.sun.com. Mcnealy wants, by close of business today, a ""cheat sheet"" of the talking points to use with politicians (the ""8 or 10 elements of the solution"") with the expected comeback he may hear from the political leaders and our response to that comeback. He says he hasn't spent time working on issues in Sacremento so we may also want to include a list of suggested contacts. Kevin Sharer (Amgen): contact person - Sarah Jensen, VP of Engineering and Operations (805.447.6785); ksharer@amgen.com. Sharer wants the same information as McNealy and he and McNealy both indicated their willingness to call a meeting of other California CEOs. Sharer will also be having breakfast with Hertzberg one week from today. Robert Day (Trust Co of the West): said that he is very close to the mayor of Los Angeles. He urged Ken to call the mayor (mentioning Day). Ken would like some talking points for that call. Jeff - please put these items together.

""At what point do= es=20 the state say, 'Enough is enough'?

Because the ISO -- which ge= ts=20 its money from the utilities -- can no longer buy the power, the water=20 department is now buying all the electricity required by the utilities, Har= t=20 said.

By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer (Published April 20, 2001)=20 Ten years of stable electricity bills vanished in a single unanimous vote= =20 Thursday night as directors of Sacramento Municipal Utility District gave= =20 tentative approval to rate hikes ranging from 19 percent to 27 percent.=20 The new rates will go into effect immediately after a final vote, scheduled= =20 for May 3.=20 ""This is quite alarming to all of us,"" said director Peter Keat. But praisi= ng=20 the value of ""a community-owned electric company"" that provides everything= =20 from shade trees to public votes on rates, Keat said he saw no choice.=20 SMUD, which once hoped to lower electric bills this year or next as=20 deregulation took hold, was caught up in the spiraling wholesale costs that= =20 helped send Pacific Gas and Electric Co. into bankruptcy proceedings.=20 The price of natural gas, which fuels SMUD's cogeneration plants, has risen= =20 steeply.=20 Wholesale electricity, which SMUD buys to supplement power produced by its= =20 own plants, nearly tripled between October and January.=20 And the weather has been dismal. Rainfall and snowmelt that feed SMUD's=20 hydroelectric plants on the upper American River are about 53 percent of=20 normal to date.=20 But during a two-hour hearing, a small contingent of consumers asked the=20 board to reconsider.=20 ""I realize that rates have to go up, but this seems like a big percentage a= ll=20 at once,"" said Marian Ender.=20 Several criticized a 6 percent surcharge that until only a few days before= =20 had been proposed at 3 percent. Among them was Duy Tu, an engineering manag= er=20 at Intel who served on SMUD's advisory rate committee.=20 The increase ""cannot come at a worse time"" for Intel, he said, although he= =20 understands the need for it. He urged the board to act now to make more=20 electricity available in the future.=20 ""We are way too dependent on some external force to keep the lights on,"" Tu= =20 said.=20 Overall, a base rate increase averaging 16 percent will raise about $124=20 million annually for SMUD, and a special=20 6 percent surcharge will raise about $48 million in its first year. Most of= =20 the surcharge, scheduled to drop to 3 percent annually for two subsequent= =20 years, will go into an emergency fund.=20 ""We have to build back our savings account. It's been gutted,"" said directo= r=20 Susan Patterson.=20 The rate increases will fall most heavily on small commercial and large=20 industrial power users, although households with very low electricity bills= =20 will feel a sharp bite from the addition of a $5 monthly service fee.=20 The flat fee adds less than 10 percent to what was a ""typical"" residential= =20 SMUD bill of $67, but it's a 25 percent rate hike for someone whose monthly= =20 bill hovers around $20.=20 ""I just don't think that part is right,"" Ender said.

Brad Sherman= =20 (D-Sherman Oaks) said the biggest disagreement between California Democrats= =20 and Republicans appeared to be their relative faith--or lack thereof--in th= e=20 ability of President Bush and his administration to help California. There= =20 has been much speculation that Bush, who lost California in November, has n= o=20 political motive to help the state. ?????""We Democrats,"" said Sherman, ""hope very much that our skepticism is= =20 proven wrong."" ?????Davis--who sat flanked by Democratic U.S. Sen.

""With these prices, you want to sell every=20 molecule."" ?????In other developments Thursday: ?????* The agreement between Davis and Edison International to return its= =20 ailing utility arm to financial health is in ""deep trouble and could be=20 rejected by legislators,"" the Standard & Poor's credit rating agency said i= n=20 a note to clients, citing legislative and other sources.

(AP) via NewsEdge Corporation - Gov. Kenny Guinn signed a bill Wednesday that would stop the sale of Nevada power plants, halt deregulation and bail out struggling utilities with a new rate system. The Senate and Assembly gave the measure final approval earlier in the day and rushed it to the governor. The bill was crafted to keep Nevada from suffering from a power crisis similar to California's. ``I must tell you this is a great relief,'' said Guinn, a former utility executive, as he signed the bill into law. ``Nothing can control escalating costs, but we're in the best position to protect ourselves.'' Legislators made a last-minute change to add language that ensured consumers would get a break on rates if utilities profit from sales of excess power to other states. Guinn said the bill takes care of the most pressing energy issues, but other deregulation-related bills are sure to follow. That includes a plan that would allow major power users, such as casinos and mines, to buy power on the open market. Legislators also are working on plans encouraging energy conservation and ensuring the poor can pay their utility bills. --- --- ----- PG&E Co. Issues Statements On the Increase in the State's Cost for Power SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 18, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation - FROM: John Nelson, Director of the News Department Pacific Gas and Electric Company There seems to have been some confusion yesterday over the effect Pacific Gas and Electric Company's bankruptcy filing may have had on energy prices. I thought it might be helpful to provide a few useful facts and figures, to help you pin down the truth behind what may be driving the state's energy costs higher. Yesterday, Governor Davis claimed that the state was paying roughly $20 million more for electricity every day as a direct result of the bankruptcy filing by PG&amp;E. While it's understandable, even laudable, that the Governor would want to fully explain the downsides of utility bankruptcy, this claim is simply not accurate. The Governor should know better. Consider the facts: -- On January 19, the credit ratings of California's two largest investor-owned utilities -- PG&amp;E and SCE -- were downgraded to below investment grade by every major rating agency. Generators immediately raised concerns about continuing to sell power to such non-creditworthy entities. -- The state reacted by passing AB7x, which authorized the state Department of Water Resources to make $400 million in power purchases. Less than two weeks later, on February 1, the Governor signed AB1x, which authorized DWR to buy power on an ongoing basis at least through 2002, until the utilities could be restored to creditworthiness. The clear understanding in the legislative debate was that the DWR would purchase the full ""net open position"", which is the amount of additional generation needed, beyond what the utilities themselves own or have under contract, to meet customer demand. However, a few weeks later, in spite of the clear intent of state law, it was revealed that DWR was not buying the full net open position, and had no intention of doing so. It was only buying power that it considered ""reasonably priced"" and was leaving the ISO to buy whatever was necessary to keep the lights on -- an amount that most estimates place at 10- to 20-percent of the state's daily electricity need. -- The ISO, in turn, revealed its intention to attempt to pass along the costs of these last-minute, high-cost, spot-market purchases to the state's non-creditworthy utilities (despite existing FERC tariffs which precluded the ISO from doing so). PG&amp;E has estimated that its share of these costs was roughly $10 million a day; SCE has a similar estimate. (We don't know for sure, because we haven't seen the bill. The DWR won't say how much power it's buying, and at what cost, and neither will the ISO.) -- On February 14, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission informed the Independent System Operator that it could not force generators to sell to non-creditworthy entities (namely, both PG&amp;E and SCE). This order appeared to force the DWR to purchase the full net open after all. The ISO responded the next day with its own interpretation of the FERC order, saying the order was limited to ""emergency"" power only. The ISO also sought and obtained in federal court a temporary restraining order (issued by Judge Damrell), forcing generators to continue selling to it. -- On February 22, five power generators filed a complaint with FERC seeking to clarify that the ISO's interpretation of the February 14 order was contrary to FERC's intent. -- On April 5, the Ninth U.S. Court of Appeals reversed Judge Damrell's lower court order affecting one of the generators, Reliant, saying the generator was no longer required to sell electricity to the ISO without assurances of payment. Presumably this order would apply to other generators, if they sought such assurances. -- On April 6, PG&amp;E noted in the announcement of its Chapter 11 filing that one of the reasons for the decision was the ""financial exposure to unreimbursed wholesale energy procurement costs"" caused by the state's failure to assume the full procurement responsibility. -- On April 6, unrelated to PG&amp;E's bankruptcy filing, FERC issued an order responding to the generators' Feb. 22 complaint against the ISO. In this new order, FERC reaffirmed its February 14 order that the ISO could only buy power on behalf of creditworthy entities, meaning neither PG&amp;E nor SCE. -- On April 9 in remarks reported in the press, the Governor's office acknowledged the State's ""bill for energy purchases will increase by upward of $8 million a day after a ruling last week by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,"" once DWR started buying the full net open position, rather than force the ISO to try to bill the utilities. It seems likely that the $8 million was an estimate based on only one of the utilities' costs, not the combination of both. -- On April 11, the ISO discontinued its daily practice of publishing the total amount it spent on energy the day before. -- Despite the history, the state continues to try to avoid buying the full net open position. On April 13, in response to the FERC order -- NOT the PG&amp;E bankruptcy filing -- the ISO sent a ""murky"" notice to generators promising that ""any bid accepted by the ISO will be deemed to have the financial support of another Qualified Party or DWR as specified in this notice."" Generators were reportedly underwhelmed by the assurances contained in the letter. -- Yesterday, in response to the Governor's claim that bankruptcy was driving up the state's costs, Gary Ackerman, spokesman for the Western Power Trading Forum, said ""I don't believe, nor have I ever heard, of a bankruptcy surcharge being added to the cost of power.... If anything, I think that generators and marketers would take solace in the fact that bankruptcy brings order to an otherwise volatile situation."" What does it all mean? Clearly, the increase in the state's costs have come as a result of the DWR finally covering the state's energy needs, as promised in AB1x. This change in DWR's buying habits has come as a direct result of the February 14 and April 6 FERC orders that the ISO only sell to creditworthy entities. These orders were issued independent of PG&amp;E's bankruptcy filing and apply equally to PG&amp;E and SCE. Neither PG&amp;E nor SCE have been creditworthy since mid-January, when their credit ratings were reduced to below investment grade, and the DWR, ISO and Governor's office have been aware of the effect of the FERC order since mid-February. Some generators have suggested that California has been paying a credit penalty since December, when the utilities' deteriorating financial situation gave rise to payment concerns. There appears to be far more evidence that the state's coy approach to AB1x implementation has created far more uncertainty in the marketplace than has PG&amp;E's Chapter 11 filing.

Power and Associates Reports/ Nationwide Decline in Customer=20 Satisfaction of Electric Utility Service Among Midsize Businesses Price and Value Performance Hit Hard Across Nation; Satisfaction in California Continues to Plummet AGOURA HILLS, Calif., April 19 /PRNewswire/ -- Midsize business customers, who are responsible for approximately fifteen percent of the nation's electricity consumption, are very critical of electricity prices, according= to the J.D. Power and Associates 2001 Electric Utility Midsize Business Custom= er Satisfaction Study(SM) released today. Consequently, the study's nationwid= e customer satisfaction index fell -- from 100 points in 2000 to 97 in 2001. (Photo: ) ""The entire country was affected by higher natural gas prices this winter, and with more states re-evaluating deregulation, midsize business customers are especially sensitive to electricity prices,"" said Jeffrey Conklin, seni= or director at J.D. Power and Associates. The 2001 study shows that average overall customer satisfaction with California's ""big three"" investor-owned utilities -- Pacific Gas and Electr= ic, San Diego Gas and Electric, and Southern California Edison -- fell an astonishing 14 index points among midsize businesses compared to the 2000 study. ""In California, electric utility satisfaction among midsize business customers has virtually fallen into the Pacific,"" said Alan Destribats, executive director of the utility practice at J.D. Power and Associates. The study finds that the chief determinants of satisfaction among electric utility midsize customers are a provider's company image, price and value, = and power quality and reliability. As expected, midsize business customers were extremely critical of performance in the areas of company image and price and value. Even outsid= e of California, satisfaction in the price and value component fell more than any other factor -- from an index score of 100 in 2000 to 93 in 2001. Power Quality and Reliability Utility performance in power quality and reliability is improving, with the national index increasing by 3 points. Although the number of interruptions and outages experienced was relatively the same in 2001 as it was in 2000, midsize businesses report much shorter outage durations, falli= ng from an average of seven hours for the longest outages in 2000 to four hour= s in 2001. Retail Competition ""Opening utility markets to competition has proven to be a difficult process and, so far, midsize business customers are giving the industry poo= r marks,"" said Destribats. The study shows that midsize business customers located in states with competition not only are less satisfied than are customers in other states, but they are also significantly less satisfied now than last year. The stu= dy also shows that more midsize businesses have switched electricity providers= . Of midsize businesses eligible to switch power suppliers, 9 percent have do= ne so, up from 5 percent in 2000. J.D. Power and Associates interviewed representatives from more than 7,200 midsize businesses, including manufacturers, retailers, business and consumer services firms, health care providers and other midsize businesses throughout the United States. Midsize business owners are defined as those who normally spend $1,500 to $25,000 per month on electricity. The study shows that midsize businesses are now spending an average of $4,827 per mon= th on electricity. The study shows that utilities in the south region of the United States consistently receive higher ratings across all factors of customer satisfaction. Likewise, these midsize business customers also report the lowest levels of monthly electricity expenditures, on average. Midsize businesses in North Carolina spend the least for electric usage ($3,885 per month on average), while those in New Hampshire, Nevada and Utah spend the most ($5,700 to $5,800 per month on average). The study also shows that midsize businesses in Alabama and Florida report the most service interruptions and outages within the past 12 months, and those in Washingto= n report the fewest. East Region PPL Utilities, serving east Pennsylvania, ranks highest in overall customer satisfaction with midsize businesses in the eastern United States. PPL Utilities ranked highest in the East Region in four of the six factors that comprise customer satisfaction, with its primary strength in price and value. Other solid performers in this region include Public Service Electr= ic and Gas, Allegheny Power and GPU Energy. Midwest Region LG&amp;E Energy, the parent company of Kentucky Utilities and Louisville Ga= s and Electric, ranks highest in overall customer satisfaction with midsize business electric service in the Midwest. LG&amp;E Energy midsize business customers give high ratings for power quality and reliability, customer service, and billing and payment. Alliant Energy, AEP-Midwest and Xcel Energy-NSP also rank high in midsize business customer satisfaction in the Midwest Region. South Region Southern Company ranks highest in overall customer satisfaction for midsize business electric service in the South Region and received the high= est customer satisfaction index score among all utilities included in the study= . Southern Company dominates all other electric utility service providers, achieving the highest ratings in the nation in five of the six components (2 in a tie). Other strong performers in the South Region include Duke Pow= er, Florida Power &amp; Light and Progress Energy (Carolina Power &amp; Light a= nd=20 Florida Power). West Region Sierra Pacific Resources ranks highest in overall customer satisfaction with midsize business electric service in the West Region. This utility significantly leads the region by rating highest in all six components (1 i= n a tie). The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power also ranks high in thi= s region.

With this announcement, Calpine h= as firm orders in place for the delivery of 203 turbines. When operated in a combined-cycle application, this represents 50,000 megawatts of baseload capacity. The agreement marks the company's second large volume turbine acquisition from GE and is an important component of Calpine's five-year strategic plan= to have 70,000 megawatts of generation on line by the end of 2005. Calpine wil= l take delivery of 5 turbines in 2002, with the remainder of the contract to = be filled by the end of 2005. ""This purchase significantly strengthens Calpine's leadership position in project development,"" said Doug Kieta, senior vice president-construction f= or Calpine. ""Calpine's aggressive turbine procurement program also strengthens Calpine's first-mover advantage as we expand our development program and en= ter new electricity markets across the country."" ""GE Power Systems is pleased to provide Calpine today's technology of choice for power generation,"" said Delbert Williamson, President of GE Powe= r Systems Global Sales. ""Our FA technology is the most proven advanced technology available, and we're confident our evolutionary FB technology wh= ich has been designed using GE's Corporate-wide Six Sigma initiative will provi= de Calpine highly competitive power generation.""

Body:: Sorry about this gang, but my new computer messed up the e-mail list. It's 4 am and I think I have fixed it. Maybe. Bear with me if you are getting this for the second time this morning. gba X-Mozilla-Status2: 00000000 Message-ID: <398A81DA.E883D290@idt.net> Date: Fri, 04 Aug 2000 01:42:26 -0700 From: Gary Ackerman <foothi19@idt.net> Reply-To: foothi19@idt.net Organization: Foothill Services X-Mailer: Mozilla 4.74C-CCK-MCD {C-UDP; EBM-APPLE} (Macintosh; U; PPC) MIME-Version: 1.0 To: webmaster <charlotte@wptf.org> Subject: WPTF Friday Amen Burrito Content-Type: multipart/alternative; THE FRIDAY BURRITO ""...more fun than a fortune cookie, and at least as accurate."" Everyone is getting into the act. When I started this gig, I was the only guy in town writing to folks like you about the power industry in California. I wrote about what?s new, what?s happening, and all the important stuff. This week, Governor Gray Davis decided to write his own Burrito. His epistle got more press than mine, but why is he muscling in on my turf? Not to be outdone, PUC President Loretta Lynch released a report which looks into every facet of California?s power business. No stone left unturned. I?m telling you, there isn?t enough room in this business for all of us. They need to clear out. With people like Herr (Hair?) Peace, Governor I?m-Not Mr.-Rogers Davis and Let?s Do Lynch, who needs a Friday Burrito? They re-define our reality each week with mind-numbing aplomb. For example, starting in early June, the PX was ordered to compete for business against other Qualified Trading Vehicles. Then, two weeks later, the Energy F_hrer legislated that idea to an early death which kept the status quo for at least one year. This week the PUC approved 5-year bilateral deals for PG&E and SCE, thereby opening the PX to competition, and emasculating the PX?s Block Forward Market. Zip, bam, boom. I can?t wait to see what next week will bring. I hear Senator Bowen is holding Committee hearings on re regulating the industry, and the Governor?s new Energy Security Council will meet to decide six things: What?s for lunch? Who will sit at the head of the table? Does anyone have good seats for next week?s Democratic convention? Is there anyone we haven?t indicted yet in the power industry? Who will crank up the air conditioning in this room? It?s getting too warm. Then, they will collect data from innocent businesses under subpoena, ignore the facts, and publish a report. It makes one want to take a deep breath, and inhale the scented fumes of democracy. You know, I can?t think about where to begin, so let?s start somewhere. >>> Things on the Island of California @@@ Is there anyone left at SDG&E with a brain? @@@ The PUC issues its scathing report @@@ The ISO invokes $250 price caps. Duh! >>> Things at the throne of FERC @@@ Amen for the Morgan Stanley Order >>> Odds and Ends (_!_) >>> Things on the Island of California @@@ Is there anyone left at SDG&E with a brain? Well, the answer very clearly is no. I have been astounded by repeated attempts of SDG&E?s most senior people to ape humans, but instead they mimic apes. Consider the following. First, they waltz their default customers into the summer with little of no protection from price spikes in the wholesale market. Forgivable in that it is human to err. The prices skyrocket in June, and they start looking for who to blame. _Must be them damn independent generators,O say their managers. Gary Cotton informs the ISO Governing Board that hedging SDG&E?s position in the Block Forward Market wouldn?t have made any difference. There?s one nobel laureate who missed his prime. Next, under pressure, they ask for help from suppliers and anyone else who will assist the utility and their customers. Nine offers show up at their table, and they can?t choose any of them. Again, Mr Cotton tells his fellow ISO Governing Board members that these things take time, and we don?t to rush since there are many legislative barriers, and, well, the surfing was good this week so why spoil it? Now they are in a panic because the Energy F_hrer is visiting old ladies living in trailer parks, advising them not to pay their SDG&E electricity bill, and to continue to operate their air conditioners. SDG&E puts a full page ad in the local newspaper telling everyone that SDG&E is doing everything it can to lower their electric bills, including asking the ISO for a $250 price cap, but the public can help by calling the ISO [address and phone number provided in the ad] and urging them to lower the cap. I always thought the location of the ISO was a State secret for security reasons. No secrets in San Diego. But we are not done. No sir, we are not. Those buffalo heads who run that company decide they will win a gold star on their collective foreheads, and implement one of the four resolutions passed by the Electric Oversight Board. The one they pick is to petition FERC on an expedited basis to cap at $250, the price at which sellers may bid energy or ancillary services into the ISO and the PX. The primary reason is that Western power markets are not workably competitive. In other words, they want FERC to set a max price on what generators can sell in addition to the price limit at which the ISO can buy! What I find most astounding about this double talk is that SDG&E continues to collect tons of money from the sales of regulatory must run energy into the PX. These are sales from their stranded assets. Their grief hasn?t abated their greed. So, to recap, SDG&E missed the boat on price hedging, failed to win consumer confidence in public meetings, asked for help from suppliers and did nothing in response, then filed at FERC to cap the sale price because the wholesale market into which they sell (over-priced?) energy is not workably competitive. Too much time in the direct sun light. >>> Things on the Island of California @@@ The PUC issues its scathing report The PUC report released yesterday is a gem with which I have not spent enough time. I only read the Executive Summary, and that only because our counsel, Dan Douglass forwarded me a copy. Let me pick out some of the gems in President Lets Do Lynch?s burrito. I would recommend reading the whole text if you have time, and if you seek perverse entertainment. _California is experiencing major problems with electricity supply and pricing caused by policies and procedures adopted over the past ten years. _ Since June, wholesale prices for electrical power in California have increased on average 270% over the same period in 1999, resulting in over $1 billion in excess payments for electricity. _Hot weather, aging power plant and transmission infrastructure, and dysfunctional bidding behavior in the wholesale power markets combined to drive prices up ... _Because of serious market defects and tight supply of electricity, purchasers of California power will likely pay billions more in electricity costs this year. Moreover, these price increases do not necessarily fund new investments in electricity supply or delivery reliability - they may flow solely to power producer profit margins. _Despite the Electricity Oversight Board's legislative mandate to oversee those institutions, we have been unable to obtain [bid] data. Nevertheless, ... , we believe enough evidence of questionable behavior exists that the Attorney General should conduct an investigation into these statewide market practices, coordinating with other State agencies, including the PUC and the EOB. Such an investigation would provide the factual foundation that California policy makers and regulators need to recover any illegally obtained profits. _A momentous consequence of California's attempt to create a market in electricity is that the federal government now regulates California's electric system. Washington D.C. now controls pricing decisions directly at the wholesale level and indirectly at the retail level and, to the extent that supply incentives are correlated to prices, Washington, D.C. now affects California's ability to attract new investment in power plants. _Past administrations' willingness to cede the State's authority to the federal government combined with the legislative creation of two non-public supervisory organizations that have no duty to protect the public or consider the retail customer. The ""Independent System Operator"" (ISO) and the ""Power Exchange"" (PX), the nonprofit private corporations that operate the State's transmission system and control wholesale pricing policies, are governed by boards whose members can have serious conflicts of interest. Some of these board members or their companies financially benefit from higher prices in electricity markets. Neither of these private organizations is accountable to the State or its consumers .... _Despite the federalization and the fragmentation of the State's electric services, the State of California should protect its businesses and consumers from cartel pricing; collusive behavior; inadequate power plant maintenance and lack of market planning for adequate electricity supplies. _California consumers and businesses deserve to know in advance - as San Diegans did not this summer - how and when the price of an essential service like electricity will double. California is now largely constrained by federal mandates from providing comprehensive retail price relief as long as wholesale prices remain so high. If California tried to re-impose a price freeze in San Diego now, federal regulators would likely prevent that action. ... Short-term price relief, however, cannot resolve market gaming or fundamental wholesale pricing problems controlled by federal regulators. _We have been precluded from obtaining the data necessary to know if the ISO and PX failed to detect manipulation and gaming on several fronts. We do not know how market players acted in price offering and bidding and scheduling. The FERC has just announced an inquiry into national pricing and energy market issues. California should not wait for national findings before it investigates California market practices. We recommend that the California Attorney General immediately subpoena relevant records and data to determine the pricing and offering behavior of market participants; the actions of the ISO and its board members; and the actions of generators in supplying California's energy needs. _Ten Actions to Consider or Act Upon to Prevent Current Electricity Problems From Spreading in 2001: ... 2. Create a California Energy Council, modeled on the National Security Council, to unify State action to resolve energy problems and to perform integrated energy planning; 3. Ask FERC for extended wholesale price cap authority to moderate California wholesale market pricing; 4. Ask FERC to recognize the defects in the California and western regional markets and find that no competitive market exists in California power markets; ... 8. Eliminate potential conflicts of interest in ISO/PX stakeholder boards; 9. Improve California's ability to obtain ISO and generator data and enhance the State's enforcement capability for power plant maintenance; price manipulation and generation gaming, consistent with protection of proprietary business information; 10. Provide the EOB with effective enforcement ability and additional oversight authority for the ISO and PX. _Ten Issues to Consider or Act Upon Within the Next Six Months: ... 4. Streamline state power plant siting procedures; consistent with environmental requirements, and prioritize applications to advance clean, BACT+ power plant proposals. 5. Institute ""use-it -or- lose-it"" permitting power plant licensing and emissions credits rules to ensure power plants get built; ... 8. Reform PX pricing protocols and structures to lower wholesale and retail prices and reduce excess profitsO I told you I don?t need to write a Burrito anymore. The Democrats in Sacramento are doing that for me. Welcome comrade. >>> Things on the Island of California @@@ The ISO invokes $250 price caps. Duh! It is really hard to describe the drama of an ISO Governing Board meeting, especially when our favorite topic arises. It seems the only time the Board becomes animated is when one of three issues are on the agenda: price caps, FTRs, and priorities for software enhancements. Otherwise, its pretty much hum-drum. %Round and %round we went, once again. A few more forced votes tipped the scale in favor of the cap. There were 15 yes votes, which included a forced yes vote from our friend Jerry Toenyes by order of Secretary of Energy Mr. Richardson. [Jerry, did you realize that the last letters of your name could be re-arranged to spell _NO ET YESO? Kind of a french thing.] I?m sorry about that vote, Jerry. You still go in my book as one of the brave and bold for standing up to that sort of intimidation for so long. Your picture in the SF Chron said it all. The brave souls who stood tall and voted NO included David Parquet (Enron), Jan Smutny-Jones (IEP), Barbara Barkovich (CLECA), Caolyn Kehrein (CMA), Dan Kirshner (EDF), and Stacy Roscoe (Procter & Gamble). Now, I must admit that Dynegy?s Greg Blue did help by voting a Texas No, spelled _A-B-S-T-A-I-NO. I have instructed Dynegy trader Dave Francis in Houston to work with Greg to correct that problem. We?re going to work things out. The Energy F_hrer addressed the Board, again. I didn?t mind that I only had a few brief, very brief moments to address the Board, and Herr (Hair?) Peace got over 20 minutes. That didn?t bother me at all. He did more damage to himself in 20 than I could do in 2. He blasted away at everyone who opposed him. He pined about Camden quitting the Board. He said he knew how prices and markets work, that it isn?t the way those academic egg-head, FERC-loving economists tell you who pray to the gods of competition. He lambasted WAPA for withholding generation to protect fish and wildlife (what was that all about?). He predicted that on Thursday?s PUC meeting he and all the other powerful Democrats, Republicans and angry citizens of San Diego would demand that the PUC impose a rate cap on retail electric rates in San Diego that are just and reasonable (it didn?t happen). And on and on and on. This man is very delusional. He believes that Steve, and only Steve Peace can save the world. He believes that political will trumps judicial, quasi-judicial, or independent Board actions. This man makes relevant all the abstract musings of the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900) ... The will to power, the ?bermensch, the transvaluation of values, etc. But we are getting under (uber?) his skin, with the help of the press. Wednesday afternoon I called Commissioner Dick Bilas to see if he thought whether the next day?s PUC meeting was going to be a roll over. Dick said he got a call from Peace, and that Peace said he would not come to the meeting. Apparently, Peace had received a lot of press, and all of it bad. That?s the thin line of freedom which keeps tyranny at least one step away from our front door. >>> Things at the throne of FERC @@@ Amen for the Morgan Stanley Order And now, the good news. You deserve this. FERC gave the California market a little wiggle room last Friday. FERC issued a last minute reply to the complaint by Morgan Stanley Capital Group relating to the ISO?s intent to lower the price cap. FERC denied the complaint, but they didn?t waste time with an Order to simply deny a complaint. FERC danced on the head of the ISO and pulled the bite out of the price cap. Here are some excerpts: _We accepted this [Amendment 21], not because it was a cap on sellers? prices but because it would promote order and transparency in the market by clearly telling sellers of the maximum price the ISO was willing to pay and allowing sellers to make informed economic choices on whether to sell in the ISO market or to sell elsewhere... _ ... The ISO has no more or less ability to procure capacity and energy than any other buyer of these services ... If the ISO is unable to elicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced purchase price ceiling (because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they choose), it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to meet its needs. ... Therefore, an increase in out-of-market (OOM) calls for generation may be necessary to maintain system reliability. Because the current payment for OOM is not subject to a maximum purchase price, the resulting overall payments may be higher. _To the extent the ... ISO Board resolution contemplates implementing a directive that generators must bid their capacity into the ISO markets under any circumstances (e.g., when system load exceeds 38,000 MW), such a requirement is not permitted by our ... Order and the ISO tariff. ... Future implementation of the ISO Board resolution with regard to a requirement to sell would require significant revisions to the ISO market rules. Such market changes could not become effective absent a corresponding amendment to the ISO tariff which would have to be filed under section 205 of the FPA.O Well. What do you think about that? Just wait. Here is what the sleeping bear, Commissioner Hebert said in his concurring remarks: _Getting to the bottom of the problem, in my view, requires us to begin a proceeding to rescind our approval of the ISO as the operator of the California grid. The record supports such a move. ... A memorandum to the ISO from a stakeholder who resigned from the governing board eloquently brings to our attention repeated attempts to undermine the independence of the ISO. The memorandum also thoughtfully outlines consequences to the markets of a return to %command and control.? _Because these allegations come from a non-market participant, especially should we take heed. We must also take notice of the public pressure on the Board to compromise its independence.O Amen, brother, amen. >>> Odds and Ends (_!_) As you can imagine, this week, like an endless string of weeks before this has been interminable. I get about three phone calls a day from press reporters, very little of which ever sees print. My shtick is just too complex for casual readers. But I do notice that the reporters are asking better questions. The public is becoming more savvy. The information flow is moving in our favor, and will disarm the forces of evil, in about 10 years. I have other problems on my mind. I am working on a new computer system. Really, it?s just an upgrade of an older computer that is a bit faster than the laptop I tried to upgrade, very unsuccessfully. As a result of the all the new hardware and software I purchased, my office looks like a war zone with an odd mix of PUC service copies, computer documentation, and diskettes laying all around. Quite a mess. Prepare for the future. Our next general meeting is scheduled for Thursday and Friday, October 5 and 6 at Moro Bay. Barb Ennis will prepare a blurb for us in next week?s Burrito about room reservations, timing, golf, etc. Our guest speakers will include MSC Chairman Professor Frank Wolak who will talk on the subject of his choice, Ms. Irene Moosen of Grueneich Resource Advocates who will make a presentation on the distributed generation case before the PUC, and William Freddo of PG&E National Energy Group who will give us some education on operating a power plant inside the New England ISO. Now for your daily bread, provided this week by Dan Douglass. Last week we had a joke about Catholics. This week it?s agnostics. ===================== An atheist was taking a walk thru the woods, admiring all that the accident of evolution had created. ""What majestic trees! What powerful rivers! What beautiful animals!"" he said to himself. As he was walking alongside the river he heard a rustling in the bushes behind him. As he turned to look, he saw a 7 foot grizzly bear charging towards him. He ran as fast as he could up the path. He looked over his shoulder and saw that the bear was closing in on him. He tried to run even faster, so scared that tears were coming to his eyes. His heart was pumping frantically as he tried to run even faster, but he tripped and fell on the ground. He rolled over to pick himself up and saw the bear right on top of him raising its paw to kill him. At that instant he cried out ""Oh my God!"" And time stopped. The bear froze. The forest was silent. The river even stopped flowing. A bright light shone upon the man, and a voice out of the sky said, ""You deny my existence all these years, teach others I don't exist and even credit my creation to a cosmic accident, and now do you expect me to help you out of this predicament? Am I to count you as a believer?"" The atheist, ever so proud, looked into the light and said, ""It would be rather hypocritical to ask to be counted as a believer after all these years, but could you make the bear a believer?"" ""Very well"" said the voice. And the light went out, the river flowed, the sounds of the forest continued, and the bear brought both paws together, bowed his head, and said, ""Lord, I thank you for this food which I am about to receive."" ================== Amen. And have a great weekend. Oh, and thanks to all of you who sent me happy birthday wishes. It was very much appreciated. KSB gba - att1.htm

ROCKAFELLAR Email: Postal: University of Washington Department of Applied Mathematics 408 L Guggenheim Hall Box 352420 Seattle, WA 98195-2420 USA ABSTRACT: Fundamental properties of conditional value-at-risk, as a measure of risk with significant advantages over value-at-risk, are derived for loss distributions in finance that can involve discreetness. Such distributions are of particular importance in applications because of the prevalence of models based on scenarios and finite sampling. Conditional value-at-risk is able to quantify dangers beyond value-at-risk, and moreover it is coherent. It provides optimization shortcuts which, through linear programming techniques, make practical many large-scale calculations that could otherwise be out of reach. The numerical efficiency and stability of such calculations, shown in several case studies, are illustrated further with an example of index tracking. Keywords: Value-at-risk, conditional value-at-risk, mean shortfall, coherent risk measures, risk sampling, scenarios, hedging, index tracking, portfolio optimization, risk management JEL Classification: G0 John D.

Bush meeting with high-tech council JIM VERTUNO, Wednesday July 19, 8:53 am Associated Press Writer AUSTIN, Texas (AP)???Gov. George W. Bush wants to compare notes on issues ranging from Internet privacy, to cyber crime to closing the so-called ``digital divide'' that sometimes leaves minority households behind in the computer age during a planned Wednesday meeting with technology leaders. About 130 members of the Bush campaign's 350-member high-tech council, including Dell Computer Corp. chairman Michael Dell, were scheduled to meet behind closed doors at Austin's Jewish Community Center.?. . ``I am excited about all of the opportunities that technology has given us to make a profound and positive impact on the world,'' said Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. ``America is a pioneer in the high-tech industry and it is vital for us to maintain this status,'' Bush said. '' Leading the world in innovation will not only improve the lives of Americans, but will also create many quality jobs.'' The purpose of the meeting was to allow the group to present Bush with their thoughts and share up-to-the minute information on the issues, said Bush campaign spokesman Tucker Eskew. The campaign also was to unveil its revamped Web site. One of its features will allow users to download event-specific posters or placards for campaign events. ? ? - USATodayAd-Bush NSC.pdf

Body:: All, Lee asked me to forward this. I'm still awaiting additional suggestions from anyone on speakers. I guess Lee's e-mail changes things. If the business school wants to go forward with a conference anyway then it may be a bad idea to have a separate one. Jeff has said he likes the idea of coordinating. Bill and Allen, what do you think? I will chime in that Carl Shapiro is very much a big wig, as a former chief economist at DOJ. As for the Frank Wolak suggestion, Frank is a Stanford economist who is an outstanding analyst and has published probably more than anyone else on electricity market design performance, regarding the UK, Australia, and California. He speaks a mile a minute though and his understanding of policy and politics is a bit naive. I should note that ICF will not be able to contribute. I heard from Michael Berg this morning. So he will not be participating in our discussions either. My opinion is let's do whatever is best for the school. One positive outcome of this would be stronger relationships with some of the University's top notch economic policy faculty. Overshadowing is possible.

Body:: Attached is a resume for a gentleman who has relocated as a trailing expat spouse to Houston, who we are looking to find a suitable position somewhere in Enron. I know that one or two of you have already seen his resume and at the time didn't necessarily have a role for him. I would be very grateful if you could take another look and see if anything has now changed. By way of background, he was previously working with Eastern in the UK in a back office capacity looking at their approach to the UK Gas regulatory framework known as the Network code. He has done a little consulting work since relocating to Houston in the online area. His references are very good. He is available with immigration clearance as a local hire, probably at Senior Specialist level. As an additional ""incentive"" I would be prepared to underwrite his costs in the event you decided in the first 6 months that his performance did not meet your expectations (Obviously - I am highly confident this will not be the case!).

Mime-Version: 1.0 Content-Type: text/plain; charset=""us-ascii"" Content-Disposition: inline IS TRADING AN INSIDER'S GAME? Buying, selling of electricity is a growth business, but some say deck is stacked against consumers By Craig D. Rose STAFF WRITER June 6, 2001 While Californians decry deregulation's failure to deliver a competitive market, electricity wholesalers have quietly developed a vast and rapidly growing business of buying and selling power among themselves. The deals take place on high-tech trading floors in Houston and elsewhere around the country, as well as on Internet-based trading systems. Some experts say this electricity trading is a key mechanism for raising consumer power prices, yet it's largely unregulated. ""Electricity trading is like buying stock -- when you have ability to change the stock price,"" said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economics professor and member of the state grid operator's market surveillance group. Energy companies say the buying and selling of contracts to deliver power provides risk management, allowing plant owners to presell their electricity, lock in prices and avoid fluctuations. The rough and tumble of the free market, they add, is the most efficient means of allocating a resource like electricity. But industry critics say trading is far from a competitive market paradigm. In their view, it's a means of communication -- a way for energy insiders to collude and raise prices under the guise of competition. To be sure, the trading arms of major energy companies have emerged as stars in an industry where profit surges of 300 percent or 400 percent are not uncommon. The transactions, shrouded in secrecy, can leave ownership of a critical commodity in unknown hands. Consider the case of power generated by AES Corp.'s California plants. In 1998, AES made a bold move. Immediately after purchasing power plants that gave it control of 10 percent of the state's electric generating capacity, the company sold the output from its plants for the next 20 years to Williams Cos. Williams did not sit on this treasure trove of electrons. The Tulsa, Okla., company soon sold 80 percent of what it bought. It is difficult to say who owns that power now. Some might be owned by Sempra Trading, a sister company of SDG&E. Or some could be owned by Enron Corp., the nation's biggest electricity trader. A spokeswoman for Williams conceded that Williams itself may have repurchased some of the electricity it sold earlier. But trading companies closely guard their positions. This much can be said with certainty: Electricity that AES sold for less than 5 cents per kilowatt-hour to Williams changed hands perhaps 10 times in the wholesale market and emerged at times in recent months with a price tag for consumers that was 300 percent higher. Williams' trading profits increased by 523 percent in the first quarter this year. Advance sales All this buying and selling creates curious confluences. In their attempt to deflect criticism over high prices, generating companies such as Duke Energy -- operator of the South Bay Power Plant in Chula and others in the state -- frequently note that they sell most of their electricity far in advance. But they acknowledge less often that their trading units may also be buying power, which could boost the company's electricity inventory. Duke was the fourth biggest electricity trader last year and cited its trading activity as a prime contributor to its wholesale business profits, which soared 324 percent in the first quarter to $348 million. It is a company's power traders who frequently direct plant operators to increase or decrease the generation of power in response to market conditions. Energy companies have little option but to turn to trading for profits. One of the better kept secrets of electrical deregulation and its promise of competition is that there is remarkably little competition in the production side of the business. For one thing, electricity is a commodity; power from one company is indistinguishable from that generated by others. More important, nearly all modern plants generate power from turbines built by a handful of manufacturers. The result? Modern plants owned by different companies produce power at nearly identical cost. ""The cost of power produced by modern plants is all within a mil (one-thousandth of a dollar),"" said Michael Peevey, an adviser to Gov. Gray Davis and former president of Southern California Edison. So the extraction of profit in the electricity business relies much more on trading. Traders' profits rise when prices are volatile -- plunging, or even better, rising sharply. Little regulation But despite the obvious temptation to manipulate the market, the burgeoning electricity trading business has remained largely unregulated. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission does require quarterly filings from energy traders, but these often provide incomplete information, or at least little that has been of concern to FERC. In fact, although the trading of electricity grew more than a hundredfold from 1996 to 2000, FERC has taken no major enforcement action against a trader. After the onset of the California crisis last year, FERC has acted once. That was against Williams, which agreed to pay $8 million without admitting guilt to resolve an allegation that it withheld supply to pump up prices. FERC's record of enforcement in the area of power trading stands in contrast to a long list of enforcement actions within other markets taken by the Securities Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. FERC has recently added staff to its market oversight operations. But William Massey, a FERC commissioner, says the agency's effort is still inadequate. ""Electricity can be flipped, stripped and chopped up,"" Massey said. ""It's an extraordinarily complicated market. ""The sophisticated marketers and traders have simply moved past us. We're kind of horse and buggy in our approach and they're out there in rocket ships flying around ... The problem is that sophisticated traders don't necessarily produce reasonable prices. They produce profits."" Before deregulation, electricity trading was a low-key affair. Regulated utilities dealt power back and forth on a reciprocal basis to fill electricity shortfalls in their control areas. There was little trading for profit until the mid-1990s, after federal legislation and FERC rulings opened the market. Major traders include large energy companies, sister companies of California's major utilities and Wall Street firms. Market volatility In many ways, the trading of power is similar to that of other commodities. But there are important differences. Because it cannot be stored and its use is so fundamental, the price of electricity is the most volatile of all. When supplies are tight, a single supplier can rapidly raise prices to budget-busting levels, as evidenced by Duke Energy's recent admission that it charged California nearly $4,000 for a megawatt-hour of power, a quantity that probably sold hours earlier for one-tenth of that sum or less. Wolak, the Stanford economist, and state Sen. Joseph Dunn, D-Garden Grove, who is investigating the state power market, say trading allows companies to collude under the guise of competition. Instead of wringing out lowest costs, the wholesale trading market serves to raise prices, they say. ""As I trade to you and you trade to me, we communicate to each other what price we would like to get,"" said Wolak. ""It's not collusive. It's just communicating price."" Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron, the nation's biggest power trader, said California's problem is not the result of trading. ""It's a result of shortages,"" Palmer said. Underscoring its emphasis on trading, Enron's new headquarters tower in downtown Houston rises from a six-story block of new trading floors, including expanded space for electricity trading. Enron also pioneered trading in cyberspace and its Enron Online site claims to be the most active computer-based trading market. The Houston company argues that consumers won't fully benefit from power trading and deregulation until they have greater choice in choosing their power supplier. And the company says FERC has not done enough to open access to transmission lines, which would allow traders to move power around the country. To that end, Enron has lobbied hard for President Bush's plan for a national electricity grid. Palmer says the notion that the price of electricity rises each time it is traded is mistaken. ""The market is always looking for the real price of a commodity,"" Palmer said. Dunn, the California state senator, says his investigation found a different function for trading. At a time when supply barely meets or falls short of demand, he noted, companies with electricity to sell have to worry only about how high to set their price. ""The trader is a pawn in the generator's game to drive up prices,"" said Dunn. ""Trading develops a level of trust. You, my alleged competitor, will bid in the same patterns and I will respond not in a competitive pattern but in a complimentary pattern."" The state senator said his investigation found evidence that on several days, energy companies appeared to test their ability to drive prices up, without being undercut by competitors. This ability to drive up prices without competitive consequence is a key test of market power, the technical term for manipulation or price fixing. But Dunn also conceded that antitrust violations can be hard to prove in court. He suggested that even if the trading behavior falls short of antitrust violations, it remains anti-competitive and devastating for the California economy. To Harry Trebing, a utility industry expert and professor emeritus at Michigan State University, wholesale electricity trading is reminiscent of what took place in the 1920s and early '30s. Back then, utility companies created complex networks of holding companies that traded stock among themselves, driving up prices in the process. Undoing that scheme was a focus of President Franklin Roosevelt's administration. Congress ended up barring national power companies and tightening regulation of utilities, in an effort to counteract their tendency to create markets that work only for insiders. ""The broad goals of trading are the same,"" Trebing said. ""The goal is to maximize profits through raising prices.""

Subject:: Re: Project April - Draft Response
Body:: One minor point: the response to the first data request implies that all employees went through the PRC process in 2000. I am not sure this is accurate. It's fair to say that most did, but I believe that the field employees who are organized into self-directed work teams do not go through the PRC process.

Subject:: Bingaman Draft On Transparency -- Amendment Ideas
Body:: Last night, Linda and I spent a fairly long time with Leon Lowery, Chairman Bingaman's chief electricity advisor, to discuss our concerns with the transparency and market-based rate language -- while at the same time commending the transmission access language in the draft and strategizing how to support the chairman in that regard. We made progress on transparency, less so on market-based rates. On transparency, Leon understands our concerns. In a nutshell, he seemed amenable to amending the langauge to avoid the result of having to divulge transaction-specific, trade-specific information. We persuaded Leon that was the impact of the initial language, although he initially said details would be left to FERC. We persuaded him that if any data is to be provided, it MUST be only in aggregate form. We also impressed on him that if, as he said, the intent is to leave details to FERC -- then more of the details should be left to FERC, not set by statute. Leon strongly advised that we seek to craft language consistent with the above exchange that makes as few changes to the draft as needed to make the necessary corrections. This will make it easier for Leon to navigate the internal waters of the staff. (Sam Fowler, th chief counsel, is a drafting stickler). Others should obviously weigh in and review this, but to facilitate internal comments (we need to get back to Leon today), here is my take on what he has in mind. Under new sec. 218(b) (to be added to the FPA by bill sec. 413) (pg. 13), under ""information required"" we would rewrite paragraph 2 as follows: (2) each broker, exchange, or other market-making entity that matches offers to sell and offers to buy wholesale electric energy in interstate commerce to provide aggregate statistical information about its sales of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce. The effect of the language change is drop the reference to sale prices of each sale of electric energy. By leaving it as aggregate statistical information, this should give FERC maximum flexibility to permit indexes, etc. As to the ""timely basis"" of information release (subsection (c)), the alternatives sent yesterday would require this to be done on the Internet after the end of the trading day. If we can restrict this to aggregate data, question arises whether we want to concede that this would be done daily. That suggests the data to be collected would be more than we would want, I think. Here is a take on how we might suggest a revision to that language to give FERC more leeway: ""(c) TIMELY BASIS -- The Commission shall require the information required under subsection (b) to be posted on the Internet and updated as frequently as practicable and appropriate. The change is to add ""appropriate"" so that FERC can consider other than whether posting is practicable. The use of ""appropriate"" is what came to mind -- perhaps there is some other word or phrase like ""consistent with ..."" or ""promote competition"" or some way of saying there are policy considerations other than practicability. There should be some valid purpose established before data is released. I would argue that the (d) language on commercially sensitive information goes only to exempting from disclosure, not when disclosure is appropriate. Please let me have your thoughts, although the tragedy in NYC and DC now underway will probably make this not a day to transact such business on the Hill. Will provide a further report on market-based rates. In sum, Leon was not as sympathetic on this issue, but asked for our ideas and further arguments. We sense Leon personally feels strongly about moving the FPA to some linkage to competitive markets. His argument is that market participants can be doing everything by the book and the result can still be uncompetitive markets. We pushed that penalizing us is not the answer -- nor is increasing regulatory uncertainty about deals doing to help keep prices down. Leon clearly does not intend this language to punish Enron -- but others who we might all agree have done things that are not in keeping with competitive markets.

Concerning Christi's question on whether we need a computer group looking at the question of redundancy of systems, I don't think we need it at this point. It is a given that a complete backup system for all commercial aspects of the systems will be required, along with a handoff protocol for emergency control over all transmission operational aspects of the systems. The specifics of these need to be decided when the hierarchy of each RTO is determined. -----Original Message----- From: Shapiro, Richard Sent: Thu 9/27/2001 9:15 AM To: Rodriquez, Andy; Nicolay, Christi L.; Steffes, James D.; Robertson, Linda; Shelk, John; Yeung, Charles; Ingersoll, Richard; Novosel, Sarah; Fulton, Donna; Alvarez, Ray; Roan, Michael; Maurer, Luiz; Connor, Joe; Walton, Steve; Comnes, Alan; Perrino, Dave; Staines, Dan; Fromer, Howard; Allegretti, Daniel; Hoatson, Tom; Twiggs, Thane; Shortridge, Pat Cc: Subject: RE: NERC Statements on Impact of Security Threats on RTOs Having watched the whole string of e-mails on this issue, I fully agree with Andy's observations and those of others who have made similar statements.

NERC is about as secure as a convenience store at two in the morning. They have almost no experience dealing with security, either cyber or otherwise. They are using the terrorist attacks on the 11th as a reason to blow the dust off all their old Y2K contingency plans and cash in on people's fears to strengthen their position. In any case, I would suspect that a large RTO with a significant budget is much more likely to be secure than a dues based NERC. Look at NERC's offices. They are in a shopping mall. How secure is that? Last time I visited, they didn't even have any sort of identity cards or badge system or anything - the whole place was wide open. Anyone could walk in off the street and shut down a large portion of NERC's infrastructure by just randomly unplugging computers. Contrast that with places like ISO-NE and NY-ISO, who have significant levels of security in their systems that are extremely sophisticated and complex. Or compare that with the MISO's hardened facility, capable of withstanding an F-4 tornado hit. You tell me whether NERC or RTOs are going to be more secure. Dave is right on with his classification of the idea of NIMDA being an attack on the electric utility industry as preposterous. That's akin to saying that a chain letter is an attack on the banking industry because bank statements come in the mail. And Dan points out a more valid thing to consider - a terrorist isn't going to attack a tariff desk, market system, or security coordinator; they will attack nuclear units, substations, and other installations that actually matter. I echo Dave's question - do we want to ""call"" NERC on this issue? It would be a very simple exercise to point to NERC's many security failings, including some initiatives they are currently sitting on. Bringing up the right details in the right forums could really undermine their reputation and nip this positioning in the bud. (By the way - am I the only one who got a kick out of that article pointing out this 3rd grade cleverness of ""NIMDA is ADMIN spelled backwards""? Gotta love journalists - always trying to find an angle. Next they'll say that the 60 in ""2600"" refers to the frequency of the interconnection!)

The statements concern NERC's view of the implications of terrorist threats for FERC's "" Four RTO policy"" set forth in its July 12th Order. The statements also may bear upon the effort to establish a new standards setting organization, particularly the possibility that NERC's responsibilities could be shifted to EISB. Also attached is an article containing the views of R.J. Rudden Associates, Inc. that discusses the risks associated with centralizing control center operations. Specifically, NERC representatives informed the press that on September 11 ""the grid was the target of an insidious cyber attack that shut down some facilities...from an information administration standpoint."" They noted that this resulted in service denials, although it is not clear whether they indicated where or how much. This event was attributed to the so-called ""NIMBA virus"". NERC's statements suggest a new strategy to preserve the role they've played not only in security matters, but possibly other aspects pertaining to ""reliability standards."" They warn against any immediate transition to fewer RTOs as envisioned in FERC's July 12th Order. Moreover, it is likely that NERC will argue that, given its expertise and experience, recent events make transitioning to a new standards organization (EISB?) ill advised. It is unclear what, if any, impact all this may have on RTO development, the legislative effort to establish a new reliability standards body or the NERC Board's consideration of pending reform proposals at its October meeting. However, we can expect security related issues to be included in future discussions of these matters. Please provide your reactions to the NERC statements to Mark Bennett at 202-628-8200 or mbennett@epsa.org

Subject:: Re: FERC INVESTIGATION IN CA - What should they be looking for?
Body:: Looks like you got this earlier. I think it has new relevance in light of FERC's announced investigation. ----------------- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/NA/Enron on 08/24/2000 08:40 AM --------------------------- Tim Belden@ECT 08/17/2000 09:34 AM To: James D Steffes/HOU/EES@EES cc: Jeff Dasovich/SFO/EES@EES, Mary Hain/HOU/ECT@ECT, Susan J Mara/SFO/EES@EES, Mona L Petrochko/SFO/EES@EES, Bruno Gaillard/SFO/EES@EES, Sarah Novosel/Corp/Enron@ENRON@EES, Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT, Joe Hartsoe/Corp/Enron@ENRON@EES, Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES, Richard Shapiro/HOU/EES@EES Subject: Re: FERC INVESTIGATION IN CA - What should they be looking for? Here are some more thoughts: FERC should take a hard look at why the ISO is almost always in an ""inc"" situation in real time. Without structural incentives to go short into real time, I would expect the CAISO to ""inc"" in some hours and ""dec"" in others -- with no consistent patterns. The IOU's have four choices for purchasing power: PX Block Forward, PX Day Ahead, PX Day Of, and CAISO Ex Post. They had ample opportunity to purchase lower cost power in the PX Block Forward but didn't buy enough. That left them short in the Day Ahead. They can reduce Day Ahead prices by moving some of their load to the Ex Post market. Dave Parquet did an Econ 101 presentation on this incentive at the CAISO board meeting in June. The ISO remains primarily in ""inc"" mode even during the shoulder months when prices are lower, another indicator that the real time ""inc"" problem is driven by the load side rather than the supply side. The IOU's continue to go short into the ISO Ex Post market even when the CAISO Ex Post price is consistently above the PX Day Ahead price. There is evidence that the IOU's are not willing to pay above the CAISO price cap for energy from the PX in the Day Ahead market. Does it matter that the price cap for the ISO also acts as a PX price cap? The NOx market in California is very tight. How has this contributed to higher costs and has the complete lack of available NOx credits prevented any generators from running? How large was the impact of the below normal water year on the supply side? The attached presentation quantifies this effect in the Northwest. (I have a theory on how hydro capacity completely overstates reserve margins in the west from an economic perspective. I can go into more detail if you wish.) Friction between California PX and ISO markets and other western markets. For example, why are actual flows going into the state yet prices out side of the state are higher? Another example of anomylous behavior is at COB on 8/11 and 8/12. There was congestion from California TO the northwest those days in the Day Ahead market. In real time the NW ended up being a net seller of about 3,000 MW from the NW TO California. Demand Side - we really need to press on this issue because all of the proponents of price caps claim that as soon as the demand side is ""workably competitive"" then there is no need for price caps. Is large-scale economic demand response required for a competitive market? What if demand response is there, but at very high prices? The demand response in California is a joke. With 2700 MW of interuptible, why did the utilities and the CAISO only get around 600 MW of economic demand response. Much of this response comes at $1500/MWh. The assymetric treatment of supply side resources and demand side resources can be justified on environmental grounds, but not economic grounds. So why this assymetric treatment? This gets to the question of the fine line between ""scarcity rents"" which are ok, and market power which is not. If power is scarce, and demand truly values it at $1500/MWh then shouldn't that be the price. At what price would the rest of the interuptible load economically curtail? Bottom line -- there are about 2,000 MW of load that should be able to respond to price signals that chooses not to or values power at more than $1500/MWh. Burden of proof -- what empirical measures should be used to assess market power? The reports published to date have been unimpressive. The Market Analysis Unit report, for example, does a bunch of handwaving and then concludes that there is market power. But they never explain why. I would think that proof might be something like this: Generator X sets price y% of the time when loads exceed Z MWs. Or, four generators set price 80% of the time when prices exceed $200/MWh. They have all the data to be able to tell, yet they don't provide any empirical measures. The only test I've heard of so far is the UC Energy Institute report that demonstrates that generators are submitting bids above their marginal cost. The PX report states that supply bids are fewer and at higher prices than last year. They fail to mention the fact that there are 5,000 fewer MW of hydro this year relative to last.

As we begin to meet with FERC Staff on the Wholesale market issues related to CA problems, I think that we need to put together a list of questions that FERC needs to be asking Western power market participants. The following are some questions that I think are important to have FERC ask; I'm sure there are more. 1. Were California utilities underscheduling load into the PX day ahead market? 2. How many MWs did the CA ISO procure during each hour during the Summer 2000? How does this compare with CA ISO procurement during 1999? 3. Has PG&E changed its bidding behavior associated with its Hydro facilities in 2000? 3. Are there baseload facilities that were operated differently in 2000 than in 1999? 4. Were any generation plants off-line due to unplanned maintenance during Summer 2000? 5. How did the CA ISO demand side program work? Why didn't more load participate? 6. What options did SDG&E have to ""hedge"" its retail rates? What were prices in the CAL PX block forward market on Jan 15, 2000 and May 15, 2000? 7. How high did natural gas prices go in California for generation during Summer 2000? 8. Were other Western power markets prices higher (year-on-year)? 9. Did the CA ISO Board face political pressure to reduce bid caps? Is this appropriate for a FERC jurisdictional entity? 10. What specific details is SDG&E referring to in its Complaint on ""unworkably competitive"" CA ISO markets? Can these be fixed ""quickly""? Please add other questions. Jim

Subject:: Talking Points re ""reregulation"" in California
Body:: ---------------------- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/HOU/EES on 08/18/2000 02:22 PM --------------------------- Steven J Kean 08/14/2000 05:42 PM Sent by: Maureen McVicker To: Executive Committee cc: Gavin Joseph P Hirl/AP/ENRON@ENRON, Jeannie Mandelker/HOU/ECT@ECT, Nicholas O'Day/AP/Enron@Enron, Mark Schroeder/LON/ECT@ECT, Richard Shapiro/HOU/EES@EES, James D Steffes/HOU/EES@EES Subject: Talking Points re ""reregulation"" in California As I promised this morning at the executive committee meeting, below are some talking points for your use. Overall message: the market is working, regulation is not. In California, peak demand rose by 10% over the last 4 years while new capacity grew by only 2%. But, as you would expect, the market responded by proposing 8,000MW of new generation - - more than enough to offset the peak demand growth. The regulatory process, at both the state and local level, has failed to site this new generation. The problem is regulation, not deregulation. When San Diego customers began experiencing the effects of higher prices, Enron responded with a fixed price which would have shielded San Diego customers from price volatility and provided prices below their current summer levels (Enron's price was about $55/MWH). After publication of Enron's offer, nine other companies made offers. Again, the market responded where regulation failed. San Diego has not accepted any of these offers because of regulatory/legislative restrictions on its ability to buy outside of the PX (i.e. the spot market). In markets where siting is easier, suppliers have moved to build additional generation. Enron built 3 plants in response to the 1998 price spikes. Those plants were planned, sited and built in less that 12 months - - in time for the summer of 1999. Where regulatory hurdles are lower, the market responds. The solution to current pricing and reliability issues is more competition not reregulation. Policy makers should: Open the transmission grid so that power can get from where it is to where it is needed. Expedite interconnection of new generation. Expedite siting of new facilities. Give customers a choice, so that they have better access to demand side solutions. Also attached is a more detailed discussion of California, prepared by Jeff Dasovich of our San Francisco office.

Subject:: FW: Summary of Sections to be marked up
Body:: Attached below is a 9 page summary of what Chairman Bingaman intends to use as a Chairman's Mark going into further mark up of a comprehensive energy bill next week. Electricity provisions are in Division B that starts on page 2 of the summary. I also have the 70 pages of legislative language for electricity issues, which I have started to review. As noted below, there are certain issues we will want to read very carefully on the legislative language. Highlights -- 1. FERC has jurisdiction over transmission component of retail sales. 2. FERC may order transmitting utilities to join RTOs. 3. FERC jurisdiction extended to munis, coops and federal utilities. 4. Reliability section is actually better than the summary sounds. The summary says FERC will defer to NERC. The actual legislative language in a page or so only, says FERC shall handle reliability and MAY defer to NERC or to RTOs. 5. FERC may order a generating utility that is found to have market power to submit a mitigation plan. 6. On market transparency (THIS ONE WE NEED TO READY VERY CAREFULLY), FERC is to establish an electronic system for real time information on wholesale and transmission services, including prices. The text appears broader thatn the Wyden-Burns bill we support. The impact on EOL and ENA needs to be assessed ASAP. I will fax this language shortly. 7. PUHCA and PURPA repeal. 8. Increases BPA borrowing -- but subject to appropriations -- which may undermine it. 9. Real time pricing and net metering. 10. FERC may allow market-based rates but only if the seller does not market power and sells into a competitive market. (NEED GUIDANCE ON ENA AND EOL IMPACT HERE, TOO. Will include legislative language in fax. 11. Refund effective date under Federal Power Act is changed to date of filing of complaint. 12. Interconnection standards. -----Original Message----- From: Decker, Larry Sent: Thursday, September 06, 2001 3:11 PM To: Shelk, John Subject: Summary of Sections to be marked up Attached

The Tax Review sets out the practical implication (increased cost to purchasers) and constitutional deficiencies of AB 128X. The third paragraph of the Tax Review details the mathematical computation of the tax and the resulting purchaser price increase. The computation sales price, $300/MWh, reflects the SP15 (Southern California) weighted average index price ($302.88), rounded to the nearest hundred, as reported in Megawatt Daily's May 8th MarketReport. However, it may be more effective to present the mathematical computation with a price closer to the proposed base price of $60/MWh. We are available to assist in presenting the computation utilizing whichever numbers you deem appropriate. The California Senate has passed SB 1X, Windfall Profits Tax on Electric Generators. We will forward a similar memorandum addressing SB 1X. We are available to address questions and/or comments. Thanks.

I'd absolutely like to talk with you about applications and potential content for these screens. As you know, we've been interested in creating an electronic bulletin board to promote upcoming activities for CR. I'd like to do something similar for general HR news as well. If that's ""doable"", I'd love to talk more. Let me know your availability next week. Terrie From: David Mims @ ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 02/11/2000 03:57 PM To: Bill cc: Elizabeth Tilney/HOU/EES@EES@ECT@ENRON, Mark Palmer/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Pam Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES@ECT@ENRON, Terrie James/Corp/Enron@ENRON Subject: Re: Video Screens in EB Elevator Cabs I have arranged a tentative agreement with Bowne Business Solutions (13th floor graphics) to provide content digitization, encoding and storage for video productions. They will have the capability to output from S-VHS, Beta SP and electronic sources, along with minimal editing and creation of basic multimedia images suitable for the Enron channel. Additional costs would be incurred by individual departments incrementally as they produced video content for the monitors. Enron would then have a choice of vendors, including the in-house graphics group, Innovision (Beth Stier) and others. We also need to determine the point of demarcation for the ""head-end"" of the video signal for these and any other building monitors. I don't know if your estimates include any of this head-end equipment which would include VTRs, modulators, distribution amplifiers, CATV contracts and receivers, satellite, etc. Regardless, we need to talk to the folks who will be producing content for these monitors to see what types of capabilities they want to have. Finally, someone will have to ""own"" the channel and pre-approve content for distribution. I'm pretty certain that Mark Palmer wants to control the content, though I don't think that he wants to manage the production group, or create any overkill. I'd be happy to discuss alternatives with all of you for the content side of this project. Again, I think that the costs will be incremental expenses related to creating content rather than capital outlay. Beth, Mark, Pam, Setev, Terrie, et al. - Are you interested in addressing what in-house capabilities you'd like to have with me? DMM To: Elizabeth Tilney/HOU/EES@EES, Mark Palmer/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Pam David Mims/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES, Terrie James/Corp/Enron@ENRON Subject: Video Screens in EB Elevator Cabs Beth, Mark - I think we are ready to move on implementing flat screen monitors in all of Enron Building passenger elevator cabs, i.e. proposal is for two 14"" monitors per cab, one for Corporate content, other for local Houston messages. Will try to flush mount them in the stainless steel cab panels, for a clean, attractive look. Technical details have generally been worked out between our group (Steve Woods and Harry Grubbs) and Enron's IT Dept. such that we know total costs are below $500K (more in $350-400K range plus whatever temporary, non-elevator monitors appropriate for Three Allen Center occupants). We have a 3 month implementation schedule. Content can be anything available on Enron's LAN (developed @ the desk top) or any video signal, i.e. Cable TV stations, tapes, etc. Let me know next steps. We can discuss funding sources. - Bill

Subject:: Phoenix/Equilon Deal; CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY/CLIENT COMMUNICATION
 AND ATTORNEY'S WORK PRODUCT
Body:: Joe R. will be sending out something in greater detail shortly, but it appears that Equilon's management would like to pursue a deal with us on an exclusive basis and that this decision is being forwarded to the Equilon Board for approval. If this acquisition goes forward, we will need to get organized---in the near term---on a number of logistical/due diligence tasks, but one thing we should start thinking about now is the ""disclosure"" issue. If the Equilon Board gives the go-ahead for Equilon to pursue this transaction , Equilon will probably want to sign a memorandum of understanding with us, and this may put us in a ""disclosure"" posture because at that point, we would be looking at a $65 million deal (approx.) with a closure probability of no less than 20% (in my judgment, based upon our past dealings with these people). Even without a signed document, the ""size/probability"" test would still be an issue for us to deal with. Everyone should be thinking about this issue as we await word from Equilon's Board. Thanks.

Subject:: California Public Affairs Strategy
Body:: To make sure that Enron is not missing any opportunities to make our points on competition, we need to develop some key message points and facts. My understanding is that the key story line is that ""COMPETITION IS WORKING AND SHOULD BE PUSHED FORWARD"". We need to be able to give examples of what is happening - deregulation customers are winning. For example, our CSU customers are just fine even with higher energy markets. I think that are some key questions that we need to consider when we put these together: Who is the audience? My answer - California policymakers, key stakeholders, FERC, federal government. Can we use this in the FERC Investigation on Markets? My answer - we have to; California is too big and important not realize that California will play a role in FERC's discussions. What is the timing of message? My answer - Wherever and whenever; needs to be coordinated. This CA legislative process (next 2.5 weeks) may be a possibility. FERC Investigation. Taking the story nationally is good if we have the facts from CA. Who will deliver the message? My answer - Everyone on the Enron team needs to have the same message all of the time. We can't let any opportunity pass us by. Do we demonize the utilities? My answer - if necessary; we just need to make sure that we have as many facts to prove our points if we do attack. How do we prove that ""rolling back"" to regulation is ridiculous? My answer - retain LEGC to develop the hypothetical of what would have happened? NEEDS TO BE DISCUSSED INTERNALLY - LEGC MAY NOT BE THAT FRIENDLY. Next Steps: Jeff Dasovich needs to put out first cut based on our earlier notes and any incremental information from our analysis teams (e.g., TCA, McNally / Temple). Thanks, Jim

Prices showed signs of stabilizing Tuesday,= =20 analysts said.=20 Experts said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's new price-mitigatio= n=20 plan is likely to curb the most severe price spikes. ""This will eliminate t= he=20 astronomical prices,"" said Severin Borenstein, director of the University o= f=20 California Energy Institute.=20 But the plan probably won't bring California a cascade of cheap power,=20 either.=20 Prices likely will bump up constantly against FERC's new price caps, which= =20 will fluctuate from time to time, and they're not likely to go much below t= he=20 caps unless there's a significant glut of energy, said Peter Stiffler of th= e=20 energy consulting firm Economic Insight Inc.=20 ""Traders will always trade in at the price ceiling,"" Stiffler said.

Joseph Lieberman, the former Democratic vice presidential nominee= ,=20 heads the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee that quizzed the FERC=20 commissioners and Davis on efforts to stabilize the chaotic Western=20 electricity market. ?????Davis accused FERC of failing to act aggressively against alleged=20 price-gouging by out-of-state generators. ?????""To date, not a single penny in refunds has been returned to=20 Californians,"" Davis said. ""It is unconscionable for the generators to prof= it=20 from their egregious overcharges. FERC must move quickly to enforce the law= =20 and order the energy companies to give back the money."" ?????Davis said the state is owed refunds of at least $6.7 billion.=20 California's grid operator has estimated that from May 2000 to May 2001,=20 power generators charged the state nearly $9 billion more than a competitiv= e=20 market would warrant, he said. ?????California, the nation's most populous state, has been hit with a seri= es=20 of rolling blackouts, the bankruptcy of its largest utility, and an economi= c=20 slowdown since the power crisis began last year. ?????The state is expected to convene a criminal grand jury to investigate= =20 whether some power generators withheld supplies, shut down plants or=20 exploited the bidding process to drive up prices. Out-of-state generators= =20 deny any illegal activity, saying the high prices simply reflect supply=20 shortages. ?????Today also marks the day that FERC's newly expanded ""price mitigation""= =20 program goes into effect in all 11 Western states with a wholesale price=20 limit of $107.9 per megawatt hour linked to a market formula. The plan had= =20 previously applied only to California during emergency power outages. ?????Since FERC's action earlier this week, Senate Democrats dropped a=20 legislative effort to strictly cap electricity prices in the West. However,= =20 California Democrats in the House were still trying to force a full vote on= a=20 package of energy amendments, including a price cap. ?????The Bush administration and many Republicans oppose price caps,=20 contending they would discourage more power production. ?????Separately, today the U.S. Energy Department issued a study that=20 supported the White House's view that strict price caps would hurt, not hel= p,=20 California. ?????The study found California faces about 113 hours of rolling blackouts= =20 this summer, a level that would double if wholesale prices were capped at= =20 $150 per megawatt because some 3,600 megawatts of generating capacity would= =20 shut down. An alternative approach of setting a price cap based on producti= on=20 costs plus $25 per megawatt would delay or close about 1,300 megawatts of= =20 capacity scheduled to be built in the state, according to the study. ?????However, lawmakers from both political parties have scrambled for some= =20 kind of solution to address the shortages in California well before the=20 congressional elections next year. ?????The FERC plan expands an existing ""price mitigation"" program in=20 California to 10 other Western states. The plan, which runs through Septemb= er=20 2002, means that during nonemergency periods the price for wholesale power= =20 cannot exceed 85 percent of the cost of electricity sold during a Stage 1= =20 power shortage emergency in California. ?????A Stage 1 emergency is declared when electricity supplies fall below 7= =20 percent of demand on the Western power grid. ?????The plan also imposes a 10 percent surcharge on all power sales into= =20 California as financial protection for generators reluctant to sell to the= =20 state's financially weak utilities. ?????Davis was due to meet the two newest FERC commissioners, Patrick Wood = of=20 Texas and Nora Brownell of Pennsylvania, today.

As wonderful as that sounds, the FERC order still allows wholesale= =20 generators to extract enough windfall profits to drive the region into=20 recession.=20 ?????The FERC's approach may also perversely lead to more air pollution and= =20 natural gas shortages.=20 ?????Let's look at what the FERC did right. First, the order approved Monda= y=20 establishes price caps on a 24/7 basis rather than simply during power=20 emergencies--a long overdue reform.=20 ?????Second, the order protects the entire West, not just California. This= =20 regional cap will end ""megawatt laundering,"" whereby in-state generators so= ld=20 power across California lines and then resold it back into the state to eva= de=20 caps.=20 ?????Third, the order closes the ridiculous broker loophole that made the= =20 FERC's previous price caps Swiss cheese. Before, generators could redirect= =20 their sales from the market to energy brokers who were exempt from the pric= e=20 caps.=20 ?????So where did the FERC go wrong? The problem may be traced to the two= =20 competing methods of imposing price caps and the all-important concept of= =20 ""economic rent.""=20 ?????Economic rent, in the wholesale electricity market, is the market pric= e=20 of electricity minus the producer's cost, where cost includes not just labo= r=20 and fuel but a ""fair profit"" on the invested capital as well. In traditiona= l=20 regulation, this fair profit is calculated very simply as the market cost o= f=20 the money borrowed to build the power plant.=20 ?????Under this definition, if the producer's cost is a nickel a kilowatt= =20 hour and he can sell it for 35 cents--as producers in the West have been=20 doing--the producer can extract 30 cents of economic rent from consumers.= =20 ?????In California, the extraction of such economic rent through market=20 manipulation has taken place on a grand-theft scale. In 1999, California's= =20 electricity bill was about $7 billion. Last year, it was almost $30 billion= =20 for roughly the same amount of electricity. This year, California's bill is= =20 well on its way to $50 billion annually.=20 ?????To stop this rip-off, Gov. Gray Davis proposed ""cost-based"" price caps= .=20 Such caps are calculated on a plant-specific basis. Each generator is allow= ed=20 to recover its cost of production, including the fair profit, but not a pen= ny=20 more.=20 ?????Thus, for example, a newer, highly efficient plant generating power at= a=20 nickel per kilowatt hour would collect a nickel. The oldest, least efficien= t=20 plant that generated power for 20 cents would be allowed to collect 20 cent= s.=20 ?????By setting different prices for different plants, the economic rents a= re=20 driven to zero. Yet each generator still has a fair profit incentive to=20 produce. From a public policy perspective, it's the best of all possible=20 worlds. And it was categorically rejected by the FERC. Instead, the FERC se= ts=20 a single price for all generators based on the cost of the ""least efficient= =20 plant.""=20 ?????The obvious problem with this umbrella pricing rule is that it still= =20 allows generators to extract billions in economic rent from consumers.=20 ?????In our previous example, and under the FERC's rule, the least efficien= t=20 plant still collects 20 cents a unit to recover costs. However, the most=20 efficient plant producing power at a nickel-per-kilowatt also collects 20= =20 cents rather than a nickel and thus extracts a full 15 cents of economic=20 rent.=20 ?????Thus, under the FERC's rule, wholesale generators still will be able t= o=20 capture tens of billions of dollars more from consumers and businesses than= =20 under Davis' cost-based rule.=20 ?????The FERC's approach is still subject to the same kind of strategic=20 gaming that has been the hallmark of this crisis. Generators will ensure th= at=20 during peak times, when the price cap is being established, the most=20 expensive possible plant is in operation--whether it needs to be or not. Th= is=20 will peg the price at the highest level.=20 ?????In addition, the FERC provides generators with a perverse incentive to= =20 run their least efficient units more often. Since these least efficient=20 plants are also the highest polluting, the result will be dirtier air.=20 Moreover, the excessive running of these plants may also put a strain on=20 already stretched natural gas supplies. These least efficient plants use up= =20 to 40% more natural gas to produce a unit of electricity.=20 ?????The bottom line: The FERC ""done good."" But it could have done a lot=20 better.

Depending on the=20 available snowpack, hydroelectricity produced at more than 200 dams in the= =20 Columbia River basin generates between 60 and 75 percent of the region's=20 electricity.

The second is the= =20 dams' negative impact on salmon. These dams operate under a federal salmon= =20 recovery plan established under the Endangered Species Act that calls for= =20 more water to be sent over spillways to help push the salmon downstream=20 instead of through the dams' power-generating turbines.=20 That power is sold at cost and transmitted to Northwest consumer-owned=20 utilities by yet another federal agency called the Bonneville Power=20 Administration. These ""cost-based"" rates cover the expense of repaying the= =20 U.S.=20 Treasury for the cost of developing these hydropower projects, moving the= =20 power over massive transmission lines, and supporting efforts to restore th= e=20 dwindling salmon runs.=20 Under federal law, Northwest consumers get preferred access to the relative= ly=20 low-cost power. Any surplus power can be sold, most often to California's= =20 municipal and investor-owned utilities.=20 This Northwest ""regional preference"" to federal power was part of the deal= =20 that led to the construction of the massive transmission lines, called ""the= =20 intertie,"" which first connected the Northwest with California and the=20 Southwest in the late 1960s.=20 For decades, the intertie worked almost flawlessly and to everyone's benefi= t.=20 During the summer, when air conditioners caused California's power use to= =20 peak, many California utilities would supplement their needs by turning to= =20 the Northwest.

For example, the BPA has historically sold surplus= =20 power to California for relatively low prices.

This is a case where= =20 the third time is unlikely to be a charm.=20 As chairman of the Market Surveillance Committee of the California=20 Independent System Operator, the independent committee formed by FERC to=20 monitor the California market, I have analyzed the results of FERC's previo= us=20 attempts. They reveal a misunderstanding of important details of the=20 California electricity market. It is therefore not surprising that they hav= e=20 been ineffective.=20 Starting in November of 2000, FERC acknowledged that wholesale prices in=20 California during the summer of 2000 were unjust and unreasonable. Its=20 December 2000 order implemented the first set of remedies. Both the=20 California Power Exchange Market Monitoring Committee and the committee I= =20 chair pointed out important shortcomings in FERC's analysis of the Californ= ia=20 market and argued that its remedies would most likely harm, rather than=20 enhance, market performance.=20 At this time, FERC also did not order refunds for the unjust and unreasonab= le=20 prices, even though it acknowledged the prices reflected the exercise of=20 market power, which is the ability of a producer to force prices higher. Th= e=20 Federal Power Act requires refunds under these circumstances. But FERC said= =20 it was unable to find specific instances of firms exercising market power.= =20 This makes no sense. If FERC finds that prices indicate market power, then= =20 the generators who bid those prices are exercising market power.=20 Following the implementation of these remedies, conditions in the Californi= a=20 market deteriorated far beyond what had been predicted by the two market=20 monitoring committees. Even though January and February are the lowest dema= nd=20 months of the year, average wholesale electricity prices were almost 10 tim= es=20 higher in 2001 than they were during the same two months of 2000 and almost= =20 double the average price during the summer of 2000. In January, March and= =20 May, California experienced several days of rolling blackouts and had syste= m=20 emergencies almost every day during January and February of 2001.=20 IN April, FERC made another round of market rule changes designed to lead t= o=20 just and reasonable prices. However, in response to growing pressure from= =20 Congress, less than 10 days after these remedies were implemented, FERC=20 enacted its most recent order.=20 Before Congress declares victory, it should verify that FERC's most recent= =20 plan achieves the following two goals.=20 First, the plan should guarantee that the average price of wholesale=20 electricity paid by California over the next two years is equal to the=20 average price that would occur in a competitive electricity market, with=20 California's current supply and demand conditions and fuel costs. The Feder= al=20 Power Act requires not just a high probability of just and reasonable rates= ;=20 it requires that they occur with certainty.=20 The second goal is to alter the incentives faced by all market participants= =20 so that it will no longer be profit-maximizing for a firm to withhold=20 electricity from the market in order to drive up prices.=20 FERC's most recently implemented plan does not achieve either of these goal= s,=20 although it does come closer than any previous attempts.=20 One solution satisfying both of these goals has been proposed to FERC. In a= =20 December report to FERC, the Market Surveillance Committee of the Californi= a=20 ISO proposed a one-time regulatory intervention. This intervention would=20 require that each generator serving California sign a forward contract=20 guaranteeing that California consumers can purchase 75 percent of the=20 generator's expected output over the next two years at a specified=20 competitive benchmark price. Once a firm has signed these forward contracts= ,=20 it is free to sell all remaining energy in the western U.S. wholesale marke= t=20 at whatever price it can obtain.=20 The obligation to provide power under the contracts, and the incentive to= =20 sell 25 percent of power at unrestricted prices, would prevent generators= =20 from withholding power.=20 Unless FERC implements a solution satisfying these two goals, Congress shou= ld=20 require FERC to suspend the market-based pricing authority for all supplier= s=20 in the Western U.S. for the next two years and order all sales during this= =20 period at cost-of-service prices.

Bush addressed a sympathet= ic=20 audience of business executives at the Century Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles a= nd=20 declared that his administration ''will not take any action that makes=20 California 's problems worse, and that's why I oppose price caps'' on=20 electricity .=20 As he spoke, the Democratic governor of California , Gray Davis, sat=20 impassively on the dais, preparing to meet Mr. Bush and then denounce him f= or=20 failing to protect California consumers from an electricity market gone wil= d.=20 Today, the White House halfheartedly welcomed action by federal regulators = to=20 impose throughout the West a system that looks and smells a lot like price= =20 caps -- though the White House said it was something different.=20 ''This is not a price control,'' Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman,= =20 said. ''This is a market-based mitigation plan that now will extend to 11= =20 Western states.''=20 In fact, it bore some resemblance to a proposal made by 10 leading economis= ts=20 who urged a middle ground between fixed prices and a deregulated electricit= y=20 market. Mr. Davis used their proposal to support his position in favor of= =20 limited price restraints when Mr. Bush visited California .=20 The White House shift from outright opposition to price controls to its mor= e=20 nuanced position today exemplifies how Mr. Bush has tempered his embrace of= =20 completely unfettered markets in recent weeks. He didn't have much choice.= =20 As the threat of blackouts loomed, demands for action rose from officials o= f=20 both parties and from consumers in the West. It was almost possible to hear= =20 sighs of relief at the White House today that the Federal Energy Regulatory= =20 Commission -- an independent body in the Energy Department -- had moved to= =20 turn down the political heat.=20 In fact, while some House Democrats are still pressing for firmer caps on= =20 prices, Senators Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California , and Gordon H.= =20 Smith, Republican of Oregon, withdrew a bill that would have placed strict= =20 price controls on electricity sold in Western markets.=20 Senator Feinstein said the White House could call yesterday's regulatory=20 action ''mitigation'' or anything else it pleased.=20 ''A rose is a rose by any other name,'' she said today.=20 And a free market is not always free. Two weeks ago the administration said= =20 it would rescue steel companies and steelworkers who have long complained= =20 about unfair competition from South Korea, Taiwan, China, Brazil, Germany,= =20 Russia and Ukraine. The White House defended the action by saying it was th= e=20 only way for the industry to adjust to a new competitive environment.=20 Last month, with no major announcements at the White House, the Bush=20 administration voted for International Monetary Fund aid to two countries,= =20 Turkey and Argentina, that (like California ) had made some economically=20 disastrous political decisions.=20 In each case, Mr. Bush's economic orthodoxies were tempered by political=20 realities.=20 The California crisis was one thing when it involved a Democratic governor = in=20 a state Mr. Bush lost by a million votes; it was another, one of his aides= =20 conceded today, when congressional Republicans from around the West were=20 warning Mr. Bush that blackouts and sky-high prices could blow up in his=20 first year in office.=20 ''We heard from a lot of members of Congress who feared that Republicans=20 would be tarred with worsening the problem, even though it happened on Gray= =20 Davis's watch,'' the political aide said. ''The president took that on=20 board.''=20 Similarly, the steel decision was partly about enforcing laws against=20 ''dumping'' foreign products in the market -- and partly about Mr. Bush's= =20 desire to convince labor unions not to block his trade agenda. Like=20 Californians coping with higher energy prices, the steelworkers need time t= o=20 adjust to a new world, the administration said.=20 ''Open markets improve the lives of people by increasing opportunity, choic= e=20 and economic freedom,'' Robert B. Zoellick, Mr. Bush's trade representative= ,=20 said in an interview today. ''But compassionate conservatism also recognize= s=20 the reality that the effects of rapid change fall harder on some communitie= s=20 and industries,'' which, he said, need ''vital breathing space to adapt to= =20 change.''=20 While Mr. Bush expressed deep reservations about I.M.F. bailouts during the= =20 presidential campaign, the situation seemed a bit more complicated once he= =20 got to Washington. The State and Defense Departments feared that if Turkey= =20 were engulfed in economic chaos, and blamed the United States for failing t= o=20 come to its aid, its leaders might be less inclined to let American fighter= =20 jets use its territory to mount missions over Iraq.=20 So given the choice between letting the Turkish people pay a high price for= =20 political mistakes -- Californians take note -- and weakening American=20 pressure on Saddam Hussein, Mr. Bush decided that economic niceties were le= ss=20 important than political consistency. Mr. Bush chose the Pentagon over the= =20 Treasury.=20 Administration officials said these actions did not represent a retreat fro= m=20 let-the-markets-prevail orthodoxy.=20 Lawrence B. Lindsey, Mr. Bush's chief economic adviser, said in an intervie= w=20 today that he opposed price caps at the beginning of the California crisis= =20 and that he opposed them now. But he would not criticize the federal=20 commission for ''mitigating'' price spikes in the market.=20 ''What they are trying to do is achieve two incompatible missions --=20 preserving what is called 'just and reasonable pricing' and assuring an=20 adaquate supply of electricity ,'' Mr. Lindsey said. Yet the reality, he=20 added, is that new supplies of electricity will not become available for a= =20 year or more. ''FERC is doing its best to square that circle in the face of= =20 the fundamental problem, which is inadequate supply,'' he said.=20 That is the kind of argument that keeps economists happily arguing for hour= s.=20 It is not likely to be the kind of argument Mr. Bush himself is likely to= =20 engage in for long.

Want to help Millions? Tomorrow you will receive an email that allows you to answer 15 questions via email responses (about United Way, Enron, and other fun items). Participation with correct answers puts you in the drawing for the employees to represent Corp. in a ""Who wants to be a Millionaire?"" game that will be played to benefit United Way on August 9. The lucky and smart representatives will be playing for great prizes. I encourage your participation in the game, but more importantly, encourage your generous participation in Enron's United Way campaign. Thanks for your help and HAVE FUN! Other items: Corp. will be sponsoring DePelchin Children's Center through Day of Caring and other activites during the year. Other Enron business units will choose other UW agencies to sponsor through activities. We need to provide promotions/prizes for our group during the campaign. Do we have Enron Field tickets, dinner at Ruggles at Enron Field, use of Steve's car, etc. that we could use for drawings a couple days after the kick off on August 9? We could send emails to Steve's group encouraging them to get their pledge cards (now online) in early and draw from the early participants.

Body:: Let's talk. While there is always some value in these things it is ususally quite small and consumes more valuable resources in trying to capture the benefit than the benefit itself. From: Michael B Rosen@ECT on 07/13/2001 08:44 AM To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: A&M - Bush Library Foundation & School of Public Policy Steve- We have been approached by the Texas A&M/George Bush Presidential Library Foundation and School of Public Policy to endow additional funds. Enron had made an original contribution to the library foundation back in 1998 totaling $250K over five years. I am working with Community Relations and A/A Recruiting to evaluate the latest request and to discuss where Enron may have interest or find leverage for our Government Affairs, Recruiting, or PR efforts. The Foundation is willing to work with us to establish whatever type of program(s) and/or participatory involvement we would like. We have discussed an Enron speaker series, classroom lectures, advisory committee seats and the likes. I have already had a chance to run this by Rick Shapiro and Rob Bradley. Although Rick was noncommittal regarding his team's time for speaking or lecturing, he seemed supportive of the effort. Rob has already been participating in some speaking opportunities there, and supported expanded efforts. What are your thoughts on contribution levels (another $250K was suggested by CR) and any specific program or relationship opportunities regarding the Library Center or School of Public Policy. Please grab me for quick conversation when you have time. Thanks. Mike

Bushnell and Frank A. Wolak Regulators of electricity markets around the world continue to struggle with the problem of incentivizing generators whose output, due to their location in the grid, has no viable substitutes. Such generators possess 'local' market power. Since these generators also compete in broader regional markets, the actions taken to exploit their local market power can also effect market outcomes over larger areas. In California, a contract structure known as the reliability must-run (RMR) contract was developed to address the problem of local market power. However, the contract form that was in place during 1998 created serious incentive problems. We find that, during the months of June through September 1998, RMR contracts had the effect of raising overall supply bid prices from most producers, thereby leading to higher energy prices in the California regional market. Download this paper in Adobe Acrobat format: ""Electricity Markets: Should the Rest of the World Adopt the UK Reforms?"" (July 1999) PWP-069 by Catherine Wolfram Policy makers everywhere have analyzed and tried to learn from the UK electricity restructuring, adopting some of the same market features but modifying others. Now the British government has embarked on a radical reform of their electricity industry, called the Programme to Reform the Electricity Trading Arrangements or ""RETA."" The changes to the electricity market are slated for September 2000. Some of the changes will bring the UK in line with what other countries have done, but other changes will be unique. Is the UK poised to leapfrog the rest of the world, adopting every market feature that has proved successful and modifying those that have not? Should the rest of the world be following the UK's lead on some of these changes? This paper argues that the answer is a decisive ""no"" to both questions. While proposed reforms to introduce demand-side bidding and encourage financial innovation make sense, the government's proposal to pay suppliers their bids rather than the market clearing price will not help achieve the stated goals of fostering competition and lowering prices.

Knittel Many policy-makers are currently weighing the advantages of deregulating electricity markets over more traditional regulatory methods. However, within this traditional regulatory environment many options exist. In particular, the use of incentive regulation programs in US electricity markets has grown during the past two decades. These programs differ in both their goals and how they attempt to meet these goals. In this paper, I discuss the wide array of programs that have been utilized, and investigate the impact of individual programs on the technical efficiency of a large set of coal and natural gas generator units. Within a stochastic frontier framework, I allow the distribution of inefficient production to be a function of the regulatory environment the plant operates under. The results suggest that while certain incentive regulations increase observed technical efficiency, others have either no effect or even lead to a reduction in efficiency.

In this paper, I attempt to clarify the meaning of market power and show how it can be distinguished from competitive pricing in markets with significant short-run supply constraints. I also address two common myths about market power: (a) that it is present in all markets and (b) that it must be present in order for firms to remain profitable in markets with significant fixed costs. I conclude by arguing that, while a finding of market power in an industry does not necessarily indicate that government intervention is warranted, such analysis is an important part of creating sound public policy.

(August 1999) PWP-066 by Carl Blumstein California electricity consumers can choose a retail electricity service provider, but most have not done so. These consumers remain, by default, customers of the utility distribution companies (UDCs). Pricing electricity for these default customers is now an issue before the California Public Utilities Commission. In California this issue is framed largely in terms of two alternatives: pass through of the wholesale electricity price or a performance-based rate (PBR). Under the first alternative, purchase from the California Power Exchange (PX) would be mandatory; under the second, each UDC would determine where to purchase supply and each UDC's performance would be gauged by comparing its costs to the PX price. This paper identifies issues that should be addressed in choosing between the two alternatives. First the paper examines the effects of the two alternatives on electricity prices. The analysis suggests that, at least in the near term, the choice will not have much effect on prices. Next the paper looks at possible perverse incentives. A central concern here is that, if providing default service becomes profitable, UDCs might use their distribution assets to stifle competition in the retail market. Finally, the paper examines regulatory costs associated with the alternatives and concludes that regulatory costs are likely to be higher under a PBR.

Knittel Electricity and natural gas markets have traditionally been serviced by one of two market structures. In some markets, electricity and natural gas are sold by a dual-product regulated monopolist, while in other markets, electricity and natural gas are sold by separate single-product regulated monopolies. This paper analyzes the relative pricing and investment decisions of electricity firms operating in the two market structures. The unique relationship between these two products, namely that electricity and natural gas are substitutes in consumption and natural gas is an input into the generation of electricity, allows me to gain inferences regarding the efficacy of regulation in both the electricity and natural gas industries. The results imply that both electricity prices and reliance on natural gas generation are higher in a dual-product setting, both suggestive that regulators respond to the relative incentives of electricity and natural gas firms.

We examine the degree of competition in the California wholesale electricity market during June-November 1998 by comparing the market prices with estimates of the prices that would have resulted if all firms were price takers. We find that there were significant departures from competitive pricing and that it was most pronounced during the highest demand periods. Overall, this raised the cost of power purchases by about 22% above the competitive level. We also explain why the prices observed cannot be attributed to competitive peak-load pricing.

We consider the hypothesis that generators are better able to exercise market power when transmission constraints bind, resulting in smaller, more-concentrated markets. We test this hypothesis by comparing equilibrium prices across periods with different demand elasticity and with and without binding transmission constraints. We find some empirical evidence that prices in local markets are higher during constrained periods when demand is less elastic.

To the extent that transmission rights provide their owners with an added level of influence or control over transmission markets, some of the historical industry concerns over vertical market power may need to be revisited. In this paper, I discuss some of the potential concerns over transmission rights and their use for the exercise of various forms of market power. Download this paper in Adobe Acrobat format: ""Power-Grid Decentralization"" (March 1999) PWP-061 by Bart McGuire Most of the literature concerned with decentralized operations in power grids has focussed on partitioning systems initially into two main parts, the transmission system and the market of users (the ""ISO"" and the ""PX""), and asking how the actions of these two subgroups can be properly coordinated. While a number of studies have gone on to examine decentralized operations in the user market of producers and consumers, little attention has been given to how the operation of the transmission system itself might be decentralized. In this paper we propose an organizational procedure for coordinating the actions of the managers of given subgrids of a larger system. Non-invasive price-quantity dialogs are defined that, under fairly general circumstances, bring about perfect short-run coordination of the aggregate grid.

Back to story Most of West in the Same Power Jam as California Utilities: Other states ran their grids at fever pitches as populations swelled and few new energy sources were developed. Now, also facing blackouts, they want to tilt balance of power away from the Golden State and toward themselves. By PETER G. GOSSELIN, Times Staff Writer WINTERSBURG, Ariz.--For more than a century, California ran a simple account with the rest of the West: It demanded and the West supplied, most especially water and power. But as the Western states have ballooned in the last decade--in no small part because of an outbound trek of Californians--this simple, supply-demand relationship has broken down. Fundamentally, the rest of the West has outgrown its electrical system just as California has its own. And it has done so in very much the same way--by adding too many people without enough new power or conservation. Indeed, statistics show that much of the rest of the West would have been on the verge of trouble even without California's help and may yet face the sort of rolling blackouts that have wreaked so much havoc in the Golden State. The booming Southwest has run its power grid at such a fever pitch that its planning reserves--the extra power that utilities build in to handle emergencies--have shrunk to levels that many regulators and industry experts consider dangerous. Almost none of the West save Montana has increased its power production at anything like the pace of its population growth during the last decade. Despite the long economic boom of the 1990s, which smiled especially on the West, several, such as Arizona, have failed to complete a single new power plant. ""We don't know how bad it's going to be yet,"" said Utah's Republican governor, Mike Leavitt. ""We won't know that until May, June, July and August, when everyone in the Southwest turns on their swamp coolers."" In trying to dodge the blackout bullet, many Western leaders are seeking to force a great change on the region: to renegotiate their states' basic deal with California. They want to end an old relationship--that between center and hinterland, colonizer and colonized--and establish a new one that could curtail California's long regional dominance. In the strange chemistry of the moment--when a once-Republican state government has turned Democratic and a once-Democratic national government has turned Republican, when the battle is to a large extent over privately owned electricity rather than publicly controlled water--they could actually meet with some success. ""California spent the 20th century decolonizing itself from Wall Street and the East,"" said Kevin Starr, the state librarian and author of a multivolume history of California. ""Now, all of a sudden, there's a dramatic possibility of it being recolonized, at least in part, by the rest of the West."" Captive Plants Feed Power to California Ground zero for these changes lies 50 miles west of Phoenix in the dry scrublands of Wintersburg. This is home to the Palo Verde nuclear facility, now the nation's single biggest power producer. It will soon be home as well to between three and six new gas-fired power plants that, combined, will produce even more electricity than their giant neighbor. Palo Verde represents a great deal about the old, fraying world of regulated utilities and about the supply-demand relationships that California once maintained with the rest of the West. More than one-quarter of the plant is owned by Los Angeles' municipal utility, the Department of Water and Power, several other California cities and Southern California Edison. A row of steel latticework towers runs off toward California, carrying a transmission line from plant to consumer. California has big stakes in a half-dozen similarly captive plants in an arc of states from Nevada to New Mexico. From California's point of view, the beauty of these projects has been that they provided near-certain power without the muss of meeting state pollution standards or the political hassle of building closer to home. And at least until the mid-1990s, California regulators virtually guaranteed that their owners covered their costs and made profits, even if plants' power wasn't immediately needed. ""The first principle of the old system was that you had to be able to meet demand, no matter what,"" said Paul L. Joskow, a veteran utility economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""If you had too much power, if it cost you a little too much, that was less important than being sure you could meet demand."" And, he added, ""you had regulators watching to make sure you did."" The gas-fired plants that are about to pop up in Wintersburg are also representative, but of the new, deregulated world of power production. Although they will crowd in around Palo Verde and tap into the same California transmission line, they are being built on an entirely different business premise: selling power to the highest bidder. In fact, the reason this empty patch of desert has become such an electricity hot spot lately is not Palo Verde itself, but its huge transmission lines. In addition to the California line, four others fan out from the plant: two back to Phoenix, one east to New Mexico, and one north to Utah and from there to the Northwest. All were built to hard-wire the nuclear project to its owners. But they are now seen as the means by which a new breed of producer can get top dollar by sending power wherever prices are highest. ""It used to be generating capacity was built by people who looked at the market to see if they could meet demand,"" said Jack Davis, president of Pinnacle West Capital Corp., which owns Arizona's major utility and is putting up two of the Wintersburg plants. ""Now,"" he said approvingly, ""it's being built by people who look at the market to see if you can make a lot of money."" Plans Go Awry in Many States Money, not the watchful eye of government, was what was supposed to assure that electricity deregulation worked. The opportunity to make it would cause investors to flock to the electricity business, ensuring that plenty of new power plants got built. If too many went up, it would be investors, not ratepayers, who suffered. If too few, then high prices would attract still more investors, more plants and, ultimately, more power. But to date, almost nothing about deregulation has gone as planned--and not just in California, but in the West in general. Take Arizona. The state has a hands-off attitude toward business, including its utilities. It has almost none of the environmental restrictions blamed for keeping California from putting up the new plants it needs. Its population grew by 40% from 1990 to 2000, according to the Census Bureau. And its demand for electricity expanded at nearly twice that rate, according to industry figures. ""Arizona should have been a power producer's heaven,"" said A. Michael Schaal, a senior analyst with Energy Ventures Analysis Inc., a prominent Washington-area consulting firm. But Arizona's power production rose a mere 4% during the 1990s, mostly as a result of improving existing plants. Until 18 months ago, no one had applied to build a major power plant since Palo Verde in the late 1980s. ""I guess I go on the assumption that the utilities plan with some sort of 10-, 20-, 30-year time horizon,"" Arizona's Republican Gov. Jane Dee Hull said in a recent interview. ""I think what we all worry about is: Are they planning?"" Or Nevada. Its utilities apparently did plan and increased electricity-making capacity between 1990 and 2000 by a substantial 44%. But that wasn't enough to keep up with the state's population, which increased 66%. On Thursday, Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn, a Republican and former energy company executive, indefinitely halted deregulation in his state. Or traditionally energy-rich Washington state. One of its major utilities, Seattle City Light, recently learned that all of its previously planned supply increase for the next four years will be consumed, and then some, by just three new customers: computer server farms being built to handle the growing Internet traffic in and out of the high-tech capital. But it's unlikely to be able to get extra power soon because regional supplies are balanced on a ""razor's edge,"" according to Northwest Power Pool President Jerry Rust. ""We have no cushion."" Indeed, the electricity supplies of the entire West are balanced on a razor's edge, with a variety of forecasters predicting serious shortages this summer. Schaal, the Washington-area consultant, for example, said the region will come up 6% short. ""Westerners can expect 150 to 275 hours of rolling blackouts, most of them in California,"" he said. One of the most striking aspects of the current situation is that, in contrast to what most people think, supplies have not grown short just recently. They have been perilously tight for the last several years--before the start of California's troubles of this summer and fall, and before the near-record dry winter that has left the Northwest dangerously short of water for its hydroelectric dams. The implication is that California did not cause other states to run short of power so much as trigger events that exposed their danger. It did that, according to key observers, with one monumentally inept maneuver. When California required its major utilities to buy power in the volatile spot market and simultaneously prohibited them from passing along higher costs to consumers, it set off a furious price spiral. That effectively stripped the entire region of its energy security blanket, the assurance that it could buy extra power relatively inexpensively if local supplies proved inadequate. The result has been a string of crises across the West. In southern Arizona, for example, the San Carlos Irrigation Project, a tiny public utility that tried to jump into the deregulation vanguard by dropping long-term contracts in hopes of more power at lower prices in the spot market, has announced that its bills are going up 300%. Most of the project's 13,300 poor customers say they can't pay. In Phoenix, utility executives who had confidently said the state was rich with new power projects about to come on line have decided to pull two 50-year-old steam plants out of mothballs and rent a pair of portable generators to reduce purchases from the expensive spot market. In Idaho, the big power company is appealing to potato farmers to skip planting and sell the electricity they would use running irrigation pumps back to the firm. Company executives figure the buyback will be cheaper than purchasing power on the open market--and the potato farmers are likely to do pretty well themselves. Deep Hostility in Rest of the West The subtle difference between California's triggering recent events and actually causing the region's crisis is largely lost in the current atmosphere of apprehension and upheaval. Although leaders of the rest of the West are scrupulously evenhanded in commenting to outsiders about their big neighbor, they are less guarded at home. The normally mild-mannered Leavitt, for example, was recently quoted as warning a Salt Lake City audience that ""California, if given the chance, would put a shunt into our veins and bleed us pretty quickly."" (In an interview, he denied having made the remark.) Such comments reflect an old and easily rekindled view among Westerners that their states are, in the words of historian Bernard DeVoto, ""plundered provinces""--terrain that first Easterners and then Californians have regularly raided for minerals, water and, most recently, power. But this time, some Western leaders think they can change all this. ""A lot of people see an opportunity to rewrite the fundamental relationship with California to their advantage,"" said Stanford historian Richard White. The attempts at rewriting are taking shape across the West. In the Northwest, Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Montana are redoubling their efforts to take over the Bonneville Power Administration, the huge, federally controlled generating system on the Columbia and Snake rivers that is one of California's chief sources of summer electricity. ""The crisis has highlighted the danger that power generated in the region can be exported without the region's consent,"" Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber said in an interview. In Arizona, state officials have gone from having no proposals for new power plants to being buried by them. Regulators recently approved the construction of 10 plants, including several around Palo Verde, and are considering another eight. Although they are requiring the plants to temporarily serve Arizona's needs first, the facilities will soon be able to sell their power for whatever prices they can command, an arrangement that could leave California just one among many bidders. (Federal officials are unlikely to get in the way: Gov. Hull is close to President Bush, who in turn has shown little interest in helping Democratic California.) Perhaps the most aggressive efforts at change are occurring in Utah, where Leavitt is trying something that could become California's worst nightmare--recalling power that Utah produces for the state. Los Angeles' DWP and several other California utilities own three-quarters of the huge, coal-fired Intermountain Power Project in west-central Utah, and have been drawing on it without incident for 15 years. But Utah officials recently unearthed a long-forgotten provision in their agreement with the plant's owners that gives them the right, with proper notice, to recall power for local use. The state has already notified Los Angeles that it is taking back 50 megawatts of electricity capacity this summer and another 170 next summer, and it may be able to take back still more, according to plant general manager Reed Searle. Although the amounts are trivial--the Los Angeles utility either owns or has firm contracts for more than 7,000 megawatts of capacity--Leavitt said Utah will demand similar recall provisions in agreements for any new plants in the state, including a 500- to 750-megawatt facility that Los Angeles is negotiating to build. ""California has chosen not to create its own power generation and has depended on us to do that,"" the Utah governor said. ""That's fine and we're willing to do that. ""But,"" he added, ""there comes a point at which, if demand grows too large, we've got to hold some of this capacity back for ourselves, and for our children and grandchildren."" If Utah and the rest of the West have reached that point, California could be in for a much bigger and more enduring shock than the one from which it now suffers. --- Times researcher Lynn Marshall in Seattle contributed to this report.

Please return the spreadsheets to me by June 21st. If you need any help or have any questions, I'm available at 713-853-3896. Thanks!

Subject:: Re: CI at EBS
Body:: Thanks for the message. Rita Hartfield@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 07/17/2000 02:52 PM To: Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES cc: Anthony Mends/Enron Communications@Enron Communications Subject: CI at EBS Steve, I have heard ""through the grapevine"" that Amy Oberg has relayed to you that EBS will not be doing competitive intelligence and that you were dismayed to hear this. Amy is correct in the fact that EBS is not likely to buy the software Strategy that provides a strategic, top-down focus on competitive intelligence. However, EBS is doing tactical competitive analysis and market research. We are providing the business units with the information that they need to make intelligent decisions at the business unit level. Amy's view is that competitive intelligence (CI) belongs at the corporate level and that CI should drive the strategic direction of the company. You and I both know this is not the way Enron operates. I hope this e:mail does not sound negative but I did want you to know that EBS is providing information and intelligence to its business units -- it is just not in the context that Amy thinks it should be in. If you have any questions, please let me know. Rita Hartfield Phone: 713-853-5854 Cell: 713-304-5428 Fax: 713-646-8861 rita_hartfield@enron.net
