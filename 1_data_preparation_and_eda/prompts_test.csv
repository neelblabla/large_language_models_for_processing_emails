Subject:: Re: Fiber Optic Public Lands Right-of-Way Status
Body:: great news! Keep up the good work. Stephen D Burns To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron Richard Shapiro/HOU/EES@EES James D Steffes/HOU/EES@EES cc: Joe Hillings/Corp/Enron@ENRON Scott Bolton/Enron Communications@Enron Communications Donald Lassere/Enron Communications@Enron Communications Sue Nord/NA/Enron@Enron Cynthia Sandherr/Corp/Enron@ENRON Chris Long/Corp/Enron@ENRON Subject: Fiber Optic Public Lands Right-of-Way Status The fat lady hasn't quite sung yet but I thought it would be a good idea to give you a readout on the current status of the BLM/USFS fiber optic right-of-way issue. In a nutshell our strategy seems to have worked and we've won all the concessions we sought. As you'll recall these were: a) to get the BLM to withdraw any interim policies the first of which split fiber cables into 144 different ROW certifications and a later version that re-packaged the issue mandating that ROW certificates be issued each time a fiber owner subleases or sells capacity on its line with a retroactivity clause that added extra sting b) to get the Forest Service to retract its May 2nd memorandum which changed its fiber optic ROW policy from published fee schedules to individual comparable assessments (the first such assessment which compared ROW fees in urban centers in downtown Portland and Seattle to Oregon forest lands increased the cost of a segment of our FTV fiber build 150 fold) c) to block both agencies from implementing any proposed or final rule in FY 2001 and d) to create an open rule making process that involves all interested stakeholders including Enron. Thanks to the considerable pressure we orchestrated from Congress and the Administration BLM Director Fry and USFS Chief Dombeck have backed away from points a and b above and have agreed to points c and d. The language we inserted in the Interior Appropriations Bill which has been agreed to by the Conferees forces both agencies to revert back to the published fee schedules prevents them from implementing any new policies in FY 2001 and forces them to work with industry and to come up with a common policy for future rent determination. The reference in the opening sentence to gravitationally-challenged women is because the issue still hasn't quite closed. The Interior Appropriations Bill may very well be vetoed. But since our issue was settled at the staff level and is now off the table we're likely to remain safe from being re-examined and challenged. In fact any changes would likely only increase the strength of our hand: some members of our coalition are trying to insert even more detailed language in the report that prescribes exactly how the agencies will proceed to determine the new rental fee schedules over the next 18 months. Through outside consultants we've had a series of constructive discussions with the agencies over the past two weeks that have forged agreements on timing and specific ways forward. Details are forthcoming but Enron would be involved closely in the process. The agencies were clearly surprised by the clout we wielded and are now more than willing to negotiate. But the bottom line again is that we have stopped both agencies from implementing their costly interim policies or launching a rule making process either now (which they originally intended to do) or in the coming fiscal year. And by engaging key Members of Congress and the White House and organizing and leading the 20-member Fiber Optic Public Land Right-of-Way Coalition we've succeeded in branding Enron as a leader in the communications field.

Subject:: Re: Project April - Draft Response

It's fair to say that most did but I believe that the field employees who are organized into self-directed work teams do not go through the PRC process.

Subject:: RE: Senate Reliability Billl
Body:: It would not be accurate to conclude or assert that the NERC language is close to congressional approval. Here is the state of play. There are two interrelated tracks at present: the DeLay et al negotiations of all stakeholders (which I attended and participated in today but did not concern reliability) and the NERC process that is underway to consider how to bring those such as Enron that are not on board with the so-called consensus NERC language (Sarah participated in the Tuesday meeting on this issue where PJM put a proposal on the table that Sarah advises largely tracks our draft this process will continue next week and a follow up meeting the week after). The interrelationship is that it is likely that IF (a big IF) there is an electric title that is added to the congressional bill that will start moving in the House subcommittee next week the NERC version will be included as a place holder with the understanding that if the NERC discussion process yields a different result it will be substituted. Furthermore those who oppose the NERC version would be free to continue opposing it on the Hill and elsewhere. So you might say there is a rebuttable presumption of sorts in favor of the NERC version (which is shorter than the old NERC version) because so many groups favor it but those who oppose it such as ourselves continue to seek allies for a shorter streamlined version. Congress is far from approving any final version.

Subject:: CPUC Hearing in SD on 9/8
Body:: In light of the Commerce Committee Hearing and the FERC Hearing on the 11th and 12th wanted to provide a quick synopsis of the CPUC Hearing in SD. It was the same quasi-legislative format as the previous hearing. Speakers were invited by the Commission and only the ALJ and the Commissioners could cross-examine the witnesses. Commissioners Lynch and Wood presided. Michael Kahn chairman of the Electricity Oversight Board was there and participated in some cross-examination as well. Speakers were: ISO: Kellan Fluckiger COO Anjali Sheffrin Director of Market Analysis Frank Wolak Chairman of Market Surveillance Committee Cal PX: David Jermain former VP Compliance Audits & Reg. Affairs Seth Wilson South Coast Air Quality Management District: Carol Coy Deputy Executive Director CPUC: Harvey Morris Principal Attorney SDG&E: Donald Garber ISO's main message was that many factors contribute to the high prices in the wholesale market: 1. Demand growth over past two years at or around 5% (98-99 99-00) 2. Lack of generation additions in entire west 3. Reduced imports of electricity from NW due to low hydro and policy to retain water in spring. 4. Natural Gas price increases over 1999 at almost 2x's 1999 levels in August 5. Nox emissions trading at or around $40/pound 6. Increased underscheduling from June-August ISO has concluded that the reduction in the price caps (from $500 to $250) have increased the overall cost of electricity with the highest total cost/MWh ($180) experienced in August relative to $167/MWh in June and $118 in July. Reason given is that the caps have reduced markup (could be interpreted as generator profit) in peak hours but supply costs have been driven up in lower load hours. While ISO staff said they will seek an extension of its authority from FERC to be set price caps also raised concerns about the affect any further reductions would have on the market. They conclude that such a reduction would deter new investment preclude generators from recovering fixed costs of production and increase dependence on OOM purchases (as a result of lower imports). ISO staff will make a proposal to the ISO Board October 6 to do the following: 1. File for extension of price cap authority to FERC. 2. Request FERC to institute mandatory forward contract requirement on generators for a significant portion of their capacity. 3. CPUC should allow full peak requirements to be forward contracted and hedged by UDCs 4. CPUC and state should promote price responsive demand programs 5. Maintain sufficient planning reserves. ISO Staff also stated that: 1. Need to create disincentive for underscheduling for load and generation a. Charge OOM cost to underscheduled load b. Charge replacement reserve cost to underscheduled generation c. Additional charge for real-time market transactions 2. Attract and expedite new resources MARKET POWER: While the Commissioners spent the majority of the day picking apart the underlying reasons for the rise in prices the conclusion of the hearing was President Lynch asking the ISO and PX to name names on who has been exerting market power. Both the PX and the ISO said that it would be impossible to determine from the information they have. Secondly the analysis they have done show that no single market participant is consistently exhibiting the ability (opportunity) to exercise market power. Therefore at one point or another nearly every market participant has market power. Wolak suggested that in order to reduce the amount of market power in peak periods require forward contracting OR increase profit incentives in off-peak period where generators many times sell below short-run marginal costs. No further quasi-legislative hearings are planned.

Kelly is on vacation now for the next week and a half and I wanted to check with you to make sure that it is OK to share these documents with him. They are what Kelly reviewed with you in your initial meeting regarding the subject. He only asked for information on the people shifting to Corp not the people on redeployment so I could delete that portion of these documents. Perhaps I could only send him the first document that is about budget but with the redeployment information taken out. Sorry to bother you but I am concerned about doing the right thing and following protocol in Kelly's absence. Thanks Stacy

Bush's=20 misbegotten energy plan and the administration's political clumsiness also= =20 contributed mightily not least by inadvertently giving Davis the chance to= =20 get media exposure he could only have dreamed about.=20 More important there's the defection of Sen.

That those high prices occurred not merely during peak usage but al= so=20 at off-hours when no one had ever seen a price spike before makes those= =20 spikes even more curious.=20 There is in addition the powerful suspicion that the huge increase in=20 natural gas prices that a subsidiary of El Paso Energy Co. now the largest= =20 gas company on Earth was charging on the California side of the=20 California-Arizona border wasn't merely the result of an innocent imbalance= =20 between supply and demand.=20 None of that may be illegal.

It isn't another recital of= =20 Californians worrying about their electric bills or about the stupidity of= =20 the state's deregulation scheme or how Davis dithered in addressing the=20 crisis.

Consider the case of power generated by AES=20 Corp.'s California plants.=20 In 1998 AES made a bold move.

But trading companies closely guar= d=20 their positions.=20 This much can be said with certainty: Electricity that AES sold for less th= an=20 5 cents per kilowatt-hour to Williams changed hands perhaps 10 times in the= =20 wholesale market and emerged at times in recent months with a price tag for= =20 consumers that was 300 percent higher.=20 Williams' trading profits increased by 523 percent in the first quarter thi= s=20 year. Advance sales All this buying and selling creates curious confluences.=20 In their attempt to deflect criticism over high prices generating companie= s=20 such as Duke Energy -- operator of the South Bay Power Plant in Chula and= =20 others in the state -- frequently note that they sell most of their=20 electricity far in advance. But they acknowledge less often that their=20 trading units may also be buying power which could boost the company's=20 electricity inventory.=20 Duke was the fourth biggest electricity trader last year and cited its=20 trading activity as a prime contributor to its wholesale business profits= =20 which soared 324 percent in the first quarter to $348 million.=20 It is a company's power traders who frequently direct plant operators to=20 increase or decrease the generation of power in response to market=20 conditions.=20 Energy companies have little option but to turn to trading for profits. One= =20 of the better kept secrets of electrical deregulation and its promise of=20 competition is that there is remarkably little competition in the productio= n=20 side of the business.=20 For one thing electricity is a commodity power from one company is=20 indistinguishable from that generated by others.=20 More important nearly all modern plants generate power from turbines built= =20 by a handful of manufacturers.

Subject:: Re: Doctoral studies
Body:: I think you have picked the two most interesting industries. Because energy and telecom both have natural monopoly characteristics the government gets involved in economic regulation (not just the usual environment safety labor and other types of regulation which all businesses are subject to). That means that there is constant interplay between policy makers and the business community and that policy makers have alot to say about which business strategies will be successful. Rob Wilson@ENRON 07/24/2000 04:44 PM To: Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES cc: Mike McGowan/ET&S/Enron@ENRON Subject: Doctoral studies Steve Vince Kaminski suggested I contact you I'm the Gov't Affairs rep for NNG in Omaha and begin a doctoral studies program this fall at NU. I plan a research emphasis in regulatory politics specific to energy and telecom market convergence and the public interest. I'd welcome any advice or suggestions you have regarding other potential area's of research based on your professional experience in the public policy arena. I appreciate any guidance I'm in the earliest stages of forming my advisory committee and curriculum of study. My supervisor Mike McGowan sends his regards.

Redding (PS NE) (E-mail) <john.redding@gene.GE.com> Mike Florio (E-mail) <mflorio@turn.org> cc: Subject: FYI. From today's Post. Davis seems to continue to put distance between himself and the contracts. Best Jeff Financial California Changes Stance on Refunds Two Sides Far Apart In Energy Talks Peter Behr 07/06/2001 The Washington Post FINAL Page E01 Copyright 2001 The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity  saying they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43 billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year. Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term contracts whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for Davis. We've made suggestions we've offered various ways in which people could get us $8.9 billion Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday. You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you want to do it it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion. The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr. according to sources close to the negotiations. Yesterday Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach a compromise. What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood Wagner told reporters. In the event we're unable to do that [Friday] at some point I may offer a preliminary assessment. The settlement conference is set to conclude on Monday. Wagner FERC's chief administrative judge has been trying to push both sides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy. Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California 's largest utility drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on. Last Friday Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative Michael Kahn chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in refunds from power generators and marketers was too high sources said. Wagner's settlement conference which has involved more than 100 lawyers for all sides is closed to the public and media. Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a joke that the parties might as well wear clown suits according to a Dow Jones report confirmed by sources close to the talks. But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers led by Reliant Energy Inc. Williams Energy Services Duke Energy and Southern Co. for failing to make serious settlement offers these sources said. The suppliers have offered to refund $600 million provided the state is able to call off various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds sources said. Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds but now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California 's electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher refund figure some energy analysts believe. Davis's tactical change offering to make the long-term contracts part of an overall settlement comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have to pay for energy under those deals. California 's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed deregulation plan which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at volatile spot market prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer so did the state's electricity bills. In response Davis's aide S. David Freeman and his staff began negotiating long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years. That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was paying at the beginning of this year but above current power prices -- and considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade energy analysts say. A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count as a refund because the deals were reached under commercial duress according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations. Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify. There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be said Michael Zenger California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a just and reasonable standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure. It's not rocket science but it does require the regulators to regulate said Frank Wolak a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight committee for the California grid. Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room billions of dollars apart as the talks approached their final weekend sources said.

There is an opportunity for Enron to participate with MEC in the early development of their company but it seems the one thing they want is the one thing we also want people. I would appreciate your thoughts and comments on the possiblity of creating a small team that could work directly with MEC as part of a potential investment and strategic relationship. Given our resource constraints this would most likely be part of the organization that sees the greatest strategic impact from MEC's development. Mark x37408

Subject:: Re: CONFIDENTIAL - Residential in CA
Body:: Agreed. Trying to be too cute with our strategy is difficult. Look about 4 years ago we pulled out of the market. I think that we need to simply accept that these customers are going back sooner or later. NPC won't even pick this up. Jim Paul Kaufman@ECT 04/13/2001 01:06 PM To: Karen Denne/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron Jeff Dasovich Subject: Re: CONFIDENTIAL - Residential in CA I like the idea particularly if we can time any decision to turn the customers back so it falls after the failure to get some action out of Sacto (instead of after our earnings release). The only problem I see is that we would need a decision from the top that we're not going to turn the customers back if we get direct access (so we can end the debate). I don't think it helps us if we get lucky get direct access back then make a decision to return customers to the utility. Karen Denne@ENRON 04/13/2001 10:30 AM To: James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT Sandra McCubbin/NA/Enron@Enron Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron Janel Guerrero/Corp/Enron@Enron Mark Palmer/Corp/Enron@ENRON Susan J Mara/NA/Enron@ENRON Peggy Mahoney/HOU/EES@EES Harry Kingerski/NA/Enron@Enron Dan Leff/HOU/EES@EES Subject: Re: CONFIDENTIAL - Residential in CA Before any decision is made I think we really need to weigh in with EES on the ramifications (both PR and legislative) of turning back 16000 residential customers. I strongly believe that the public hit we will take will be far greater than our actual out-of-pocket losses. We will be crucified by the public media consumer groups legislators governor attorney general etc. and this action will reaffirm our reputation of packing up and leaving when it's not in our interest. The impact of this action would be exacerbated since it is on the heels of UC/CSU. I would also argue that this hurts our national dereg efforts. If we're advocating that competition and choice benefits consumers and then we turn around and pull out of a market and abandon customers when we're not profiting we'll kill any chances we have of ever serving retail customers in California -- or in any other state. We look foolish advocating for direct access when we're not willing to serve our existing -- let alone future customers What about a preemptive strike that engages these 16000 customers to weigh in on direct access -- i.e. a letter that says Enron may be forced to cancel its contract -- call/write/send the enclosed postcard to your legislator and tell them you want to keep your right to choose your energy service provider. Our credibility is on the line. Before we take this action we need to be cognizant of all the long-range strategic implications and we need to seriously weigh the negative impact this will have on our corporate reputation on our legislative abilities and on our commercial success going forward. kd James D Steffes 04/12/2001 09:05 PM To: Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT Sandra McCubbin/NA/Enron@Enron Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron Janel Guerrero/Corp/Enron@Enron Mark Palmer/Corp/Enron@ENRON Karen Denne/Corp/Enron@ENRON Susan J Mara/NA/Enron Peggy Mahoney/HOU/EES@EES Harry Kingerski/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Dan Leff/HOU/EES@EES Subject: CONFIDENTIAL - Residential in CA In the meeting today no decision was made about what to do with Enron's 16000 residential customers. Each of the contracts gives a basic 30 day out right to Enron. That being said I think that we have a short window to push for DA before any public action impacts us in Sacramento. I realize that the ultimate action (which I think is inevitable) makes it harder for our advocacy on DA but real $ are flowing out of the company. EES will give us notice when a decision is reached.

That those high prices occurred not merely during peak usage but al= so=20 at off-hours when no one had ever seen a price spike before makes those= =20 spikes even more curious.=20 There is in addition the powerful suspicion that the huge increase in=20 natural gas prices that a subsidiary of El Paso Energy Co. now the largest= =20 gas company on Earth was charging on the California side of the=20 California-Arizona border wasn't merely the result of an innocent imbalance= =20 between supply and demand.=20 None of that may be illegal.

It isn't another recital of= =20 Californians worrying about their electric bills or about the stupidity of= =20 the state's deregulation scheme or how Davis dithered in addressing the=20 crisis.

Because these questions go beyond a FERC practitioner's expertise we asked Donna to work with a Constitutional Law expert at V&E to determine whether and under what circumstances the President's authority may be extended beyond the authorities discussed in the memo. We will let you know what we learn from that further research. Sarah

Subject:: Challenge to exercise of Eminent Domain - Confidential Attorney
 Work Product
Body:: Although I don't yet have all the facts Steve Hall said that late yesterday (Friday) afternoon the Governor exercised eminent domain over the IOU forward contracts that the PX had been in the process of auctioning to pay PX participants. I would like Bracewell to research at least the following two possible ways this action is unlawful. First this violates the banking provisions of the PX tariff (Section 6). These provisions requires the PX to hold all PX accounts in trust for PX participants. Second these are wholesale contracts and the State only has the right to exercise eminent domain concerning retail service. I don't have any law to support the second idea but think it should be researched nonetheless.

Subject:: Re: Gov Geringer meeting
Body:: I'll do it. I saw Steve Reynolds (the govs assistant) today and told him I would do it. I have a lot of respect for Geringer. I may try to persuade them that they should reach out to FERC and Congress as a state that sees the need for a federal role in transmiission and encourages FERC to act. Any background you have would be most appreciated.

The meeting is on May 30th in Cheyenne. Mr. Lay told the Governor that he would not be able to make it on that date but promised that a senior Enron exectutive would be there. I spoke with Governor Geringer's staff person again this past week and was hoping that Paul Kaufman could be the senior executive but no such luck (unless you give Paul a huge new title!). In talking with Maureen I understand that you have a previous conflict Steve but I am hoping that you can review your calendar to see if you could make an adjustment in order to meet the request of the Governor. Your speech would be in the morning--I've been told about 9 o clock or so---which would allow for you to leave by noonish. I

Subject:: Re: Computer Based Communications Training Initiative - Response
 Reminder for Feedback
Body:: My message cut off... The conclusion is that while we continue to need to address the kinds of issues laid out in your recommnedations we need to look at solutions which may go deeper to adress our communications problems .. . solutions which have become available only recently. Why not have these guys focus on an online training program to both teach people how to make information available and accessible (eg by recording information and updating on the intranet) and demonstrating the importance of this activity to the success of the organization. I think you and your team have done a fine job dealing with the traditional (and perhaps largely insoluble problems) that this group wants to take on. I am pessimistic that the program outlined below will provide anything other than marginal improvements. I am somewhat optimistic though that we may be able to bypass many of these problems (and get to the heart of what people are really complaining about in the survey) by instituting real knowledge management at Enron.

Steven J Kean@ENRON 05/23/2001 06:40 PM To: Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT@ECT Mary Joyce/Enron@EnronXGate cc: Subject: Conversation with Wanda Curry Today Mary Joyce and I met with Wanda Curry. I realize that there is some concern that Wanda is a litigation threat so for the purposes of soliciting legal advice and in anticipation of litigation I am forwarding my recollection of today's meeting to you: Wanda remains very emotional about what she perceives as unfair and discriminatory treatment. When I asked her what she meant specifically (and did she intend those terms to have their legal meaning) she said that she did not intend the legal meaning of those terms rather she on a personal level felt that the company should have treated her better. She mentioned specifically: that no one ever called to explain in detail why she had not been further promoted at Enron or given more responsibility at Enron that she viewed the job in Sally Beck's organization as unsatisfactory (because Sally should be treated as a peer not a superior) and that she felt as though she did not have the support of upper management of the company. I described several options for her: Take the job she was offered in Sally Beck's organization Take the job in Rick Buy's organization (I said I would have to talk to Rick again) Take severence under the standard package Take severence as a business reorg but consult with Enron for a period. At first she seemed most interested in the fourth option (although she wasn't particularly happy about any of the alternatives) but at the end of the discussion expressed interest in the second option. A large part of the conversation involved discussion of Wanda's complaints about how she had been treated. Most of Wanda's concerns focussed on jobs she did not get or jobs she felt were taken from her reduced scope of control and the fact that she felt that her supervisors did not communicate with her sufficiently prior to or subsequent to making their decisions about job assignments. I suggested that there were likely two sides to the story and that most of the problem was insufficient communication or perhaps some insensitivity. I also pointed out that in all my conversations I heard good things about her performance and had no indication that anyone had treated her unfairly. Wanda did complain about many things but never once complained about her pay at Enron. Mary these are my recollections from today. Do you have anything to add?

The Congressman's main request was to include Ken Lay's name on their invitation which Ken Lay graciously agreed to do so the Congressman is most pleased. Thus the remaining request to attend and give additional money is up to you although if we have room in our budget and Ken Lay or Tom White were available I would recommend their attendance.

Subject:: India
Body:: Want to pass on some info on India from a conversation last night with Brenda Meisner a lawyer at Verner Liipfert etc. (Saw her at the NRSC quarterly dinner). As you know her firm represents the Government of India. She initiated the conversation on India and our issues there saying something to the effect that the firm has told the Indian government how important Enron is and how close Ken is to the White House. They also told the Embassy that the issue would NOT likely come up in the Bush meeting with the PM since the Finance Minister will be in town for World Bank meetings and they assumed it would come up at that level. I said I was not handling the issue. She said the firm would be open to trying to work out the issue or help with same in bringing the two sides together. Also reminded me that Sen. Dole is at the firm. All I said on substance was that certainly India understood the importance of this issue on the foreign investment climate there. FYI. John

Subject:: RE: Update - Jeff Skilling Conference Call with John Q Anderson
Body:: Jim -- Will focus on the funding source as one of the issues in the drafts. I assume we would want FERC to have to approve their budget correct? When you say not industry funding -- where else would it come from? I assume we don't want to allow the piper to call the tune so to speak based on who pays the bill? My recollection is that in the NERC version of the bill they walled off the funding in a manner we would find objectionable but let me double check that fact.

EMSHWILLER Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL LOS ANGELES -- California may be struggling to keep its lights on but one thing there is no shortage of is accusations over who is to blame for an electricity crisis that has sent power prices skyrocketing. In recent days top California officials have stepped up their rhetoric against a handful of merchant power companies many of them Texas-based that supply the state with much of its juice. Gov. Gray Davis says companies such as Reliant Energy Inc. of Houston have engaged in unconscionable price-gouging. Loretta Lynch president of the California Public Utilities Commission and a Davis appointee proclaims that a cartel of electricity producers has created artificial shortages. Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante is backing a bill that would make energy price-fixing a felony and as a private citizen he is suing several major power producers in Los Angeles state court. Investigations Under Way About half a dozen investigations are being conducted by entities ranging from state legislative committees to the California attorney general's office. So far these probes -- some of which have been under way for months -- haven't yet yielded either civil or criminal charges. While the energy suppliers are generating unconscionable profits the question remains whether they are illegal profits says California Attorney General Bill Lockyer who has offered rewards of as much as hundreds of millions of dollars for information about lawbreaking in the energy business. Mr. Lockyer says he believes his office will eventually file civil charges against suppliers. He would very much like to add criminal counts. I would love to personally escort [Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth] Lay to an 8 x 10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says 'Hi my name is Spike honey'  adds Mr. Lockyer. Houston-based Enron is a major energy-trading company. Like other such firms Enron has denied wrongdoing in the California market. Mark Palmer Enron's vice president for corporate communications said Mr. Lockyer's comment about Mr. Lay  is so counterproductive that it doesn't merit a response. Investigators and academics say there is abundant evidence that individual firms have been exercising market power. This term is used to denote efforts to influence wholesale-electricity prices such as by withholding supplies. The California Independent System Operator or ISO which manages the state's electric transmission grid estimates that by exercising market power suppliers may have added about $6.8 billion to the cost of electricity in the state since early last year. A single firm exercising such power isn't necessarily illegal says Severin Borenstein director of the University of California Energy Institute. If a company is a large supplier in the state and you're not exercising market power you are not doing your job on behalf of shareholders he says. Mr. Borenstein and others say that there are steps that should be taken against suppliers. They note that under federal power law the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission can order refunds for wholesale prices that are above just and reasonable levels. So far FERC has tentatively ordered California suppliers to make tens of millions of dollars of such refunds as part of that agency's ongoing inquiry into the California market. Critics of the suppliers and FERC say the refunds should be in the billions of dollars. The power industry not surprisingly says there is nothing to accusations of price manipulation or collusion. Executives point to a botched state-utility-deregulation plan that relies heavily on volatile spot-market purchases. Suppliers note that over the past decade California didn't build enough new power plants to keep up with demand growth. The allegations of manipulation are a lot of sound and fury and they won't produce anything says Gary Ackerman executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum an industry trade group. Investigations Aplenty In the year since California's energy deregulation plan began resulting in higher prices and even blackouts a flurry of investigations has gotten under way. Here are the main ones: Agency ????Investigation Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ????Whether generators are charging more than just and reasonable rates as demanded by the Federal Power Act whether El Paso Corp. used its position as a major natural-gas supplier to the state to illegally drive up the price of fuel used to generate electricity. California Public Utilities Commission and the State Attorney General ????Whether generators and power traders have acted illegally through collusion or other means to artificially inflate electricity prices. PUC and California Independent System Operator ????Whether generation plants were shut down for spurious reasons in order to create supply shortages and thus to raise electricity prices. California Electricity Oversight Board ????Whether patterns of bidding and pricing in California's electricity auction indicate collusive or otherwise illegal behavior. Sources: state and federal agencies Power generators also point to sharp increases in some of their costs particularly natural gas which is a major power-plant fuel. This rise in natural-gas prices also has set off a flurry of investigations over possible manipulation. One such case involving El Paso Corp. Houston is the subject of probes by federal and state officials. El Paso denies any wrongdoing. While power-industry officials say they have been cooperating with the investigations law-enforcement officials say they have hit some roadblocks. For instance Mr. Lockyer's office has gone to San Francisco state court to enforce subpoenas against Reliant Houston-based Dynegy Inc. and Southern Co. and Mirant Corp. both of Atlanta after the companies resisted turning over certain business documents they deemed confidential. Investigators have zeroed in on the increased frequency with which plants are going out of service for unscheduled outages. At times several thousand fewer megawatts of capacity are available than a year ago. A thousand megawatts can power about one million homes. 'Forced Outage' Rate Rises Generators say that this increased forced outage rate shows that tight supplies over the past year have required them to run plants some of them more than 40 years old for long periods without routine maintenance. This combination has produced more breakdowns. Plants have been running flat out says Tom Williams a spokesman for Duke Energy Co. Charlotte N.C. which says that its California power plants produced 50% more electricity in 2000 than in 1999. At the same time during periods of lower demand the number of unplanned outages often seems to rise enough to keep supplies tight says Frank Wolak a Stanford University professor and chairman of the ISO's market surveillance committee. Clearly something is going on here. However he and others say that it is almost impossible to tell why a particular pipe failed or whether such a failure was a legitimate reason to reduce output. Some of the most intriguing evidence to date about forced outages surfaced in a federal case. FERC officials said an investigation had raised questions about whether two major power companies had taken plants out of service in order to reap higher electricity prices. The charges against AES Corp. Arlington Va. which owns the plants and Williams Cos. Tulsa Okla. which markets their output asserted that those actions allowed the companies to reap an extra $10.8 million in revenue. In one instance according to case filings a Williams employee indicated to AES officials that his firm wouldn't financially penalize AES for extending an outage at one plant. This conversation which was voluntarily divulged by Williams could be an indication of collusion. Williams and AES settled the case without admitting any wrongdoing by paying back $8 million to the ISO and by taking certain other measures. A Williams spokeswoman says the employee who talked to AES was counseled not to enter into any conversations of that nature in the future. Another issue raised by the FERC case touched on maintenance procedures. According to the filings AES stopped doing a certain procedure to keep its plant's cooling system from getting clogged. The clogging of the system was cited as a reason for one of the forced outages. Mark Woodruff president of the AES unit that operates the plant in question says the company substituted what it felt was an equally effective maintenance procedure. If someone was looking to keep supplies tight and prices high changes in maintenance procedures would be an easy way to ensure that plants particularly old ones have frequent forced outages says a senior utility-industry executive. By restricting maintenance resources he says an operator can simply allow a plant to take itself out of service. Write to John R.

Now California has power watches and power warnings to guide residents through days of summer blackouts. ??Beginning next week forecasters who look at variables like electricity loads and transmission constraints instead of wind speeds and barometric pressure will lay the odds of blackouts being imposed the next day. If those odds appear to be 50-50 or greater they will issue a power warning. ??In addition the California Independent System Operator will issue 30-minute advisories to warn state residents that blackouts are probably imminent. ??The new warnings are in response to complaints that blackouts have taken people by surprise. ??What we're hearing from the public is they wanted a little more heads-up when it comes to blackouts said ISO spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle. ??Meanwhile Gov. Gray Davis was in Chicago Monday to hear firsthand from city officials about how an advance notification program can work. State lawmakers are exploring ways to provide Californians with greater notice of potential blackouts including scheduling them in advance. ??In Chicago where aging lines and structural limitations have produced a string of power outages over the past two summers residents often receive 30 minutes warning a blackout is coming and grid operators work with city agencies and police to ensure criminals don't take advantage of the opportunity. ??California's new warning system has considerable limits. ??The ISO after all does not determine where blackouts occur. They simply tell the three utilities in the system _ Pacific Gas & Electric Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric _ when to shut off power and how much to turn off. ??It is up to the utilities to determine where the blackouts occur. ??PG&E's website posts which of 14 outage blocks is next to be hit so anyone who knows their block number could use information from PG&E and the ISO websites to prepare for a blackout. ??PG&E spokesman John Nelson said the Northern California utility can make tens of thousands of phone calls to businesses and customers who need power for life-support systems and other medical necessities in a very short period of time. ??We think that anything that increases the amount of time that we're given by the ISO . . . is a good thing Nelson said adding that at the beginning of this year the utility was assuming that it would get about 30 minutes notice before blackouts were ordered. ??In another development on Monday state Controller Kathleen Connell issued another warning about the financial toll California's energy crisis is taking on the state treasury. Connell said the state could run out of cash by Sept. 1 if $ 13.4 billion in revenue bonds aren't sold. ??The state plans to sell the bonds in late August to cover the cost of buying electricity needed by financially troubled Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison to serve their customers. ??Even if the bonds go through without a hitch Connell said the state will have to seek more bonds or borrow between $3 billion and $5 billion beginning February 2002 to continue buying power. She said electricity purchases are costing the state more than the governor anticipated and far less has been bought through long-term contracts than Davis planned. ??But the governor's top energy aides challenged Connell's analysis and said they believe long-term contracts now being put in place combined with conservation efforts will bring spending down. Joe Fichera a Davis financial adviser said the state spent $1.8 billion to buy power in April only 1.4 percent higher than the $1.78 billion estimated. ??I think reasonable people can differ in terms of the projections Fichera said. I don't know what's underlying all of her assumptions and such. We do have more complete information . . . . ??To highlight the exorbitant costs of power Connell pointed to an enlarged picture of a $533 million check the state sent the Mirant Corp. for April power purchases. ??Mirant defended its sales. Included in its April sales were $126 million worth of electricity that the company bought from companies unwilling to sell to California but which Mirant purchased and then sold to California at a 12 percent markup according to figures released by the company. ??If the intent was to somehow attack Mirant for its role in the California market in April then I'd have to say that the state has apparently decided to bite a helping hand said Randy Harrison CEO of Mirant's western U.S. operations. ??KRT CALIFORNIA is a premium service of Knight Ridder/Tribune ??(c) 2001 Contra Costa Times (Walnut Creek Calif.). ??Visit the Contra Costa Times on the Web at http://www.cctimes.com/ JOURNAL-CODE: CC LOAD-DATE: May 22 2001 of 85 DOCUMENTS 2001 Copley News Service News Service 22 2001 Tuesday SECTION: State and regional LENGTH: 1066 words HEADLINE: State sends $533.2 million to company part of April bill BYLINE: Ed Mendel DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??One of the biggest single checks ever issued by the state of California $533.2 million went to an Atlanta-based firm Friday for power purchased for California utility customers during a single month April. ??Mirant formerly Southern Energy says more than half of the power came from three plants in the San Francisco Bay Area that it purchased from Pacific Gas and Electric for $801 million under a failed deregulation plan. ??State Treasurer Kathleen Connell who displayed a blown-up copy of the check at a news conference yesterday said she thinks the state has failed to obtain enough cheap long-term power contracts and will have to borrow more than the $13.4 billion planned. ??Connell an elected official who issues state checks said the power bills she had paid by last Thursday totaling $5.1 billion provide no basis for assuming that the price of electricity ''is dropping and that it will continue to drop through the summer.'' ??But a consultant for Gov. Gray Davis said the state which has more long-term contracts than Connell has seen is on track to control power costs with the aid of conservation and that it plans to meet its goals without additional borrowing. ??''I think the public should have confidence that this is not a rosy scenario'' said Joseph Fichera of Saber Partners a Davis consultant. ''It's the expected scenario.'' ??The state plans to issue a bond of up to $13.4 billion in late August that will repay the general-fund taxpayer money used for power purchases about $7 billion so far. The bond will be paid off over 15 years by utility customers. ??Davis has declined to reveal details of state spending for power arguing that the information would be used by power suppliers to submit higher bids. A group of newspapers and Republican legislators have filed lawsuits to force disclosure. ??Connell said she has received 25 contracts from 17 power suppliers. She declined to release details of the contracts saying they are complicated and have varying prices. ??Connell said the check for $533181235 issued to Mirant Friday is one of the largest she has written since taking office in 1995. ??''This purchase was made entirely at spot-market prices'' Connell said ''even though the Department of Water Resources (the state agency that purchases power) has an executed long-term contract with this company.'' ??Mirant said in a statement that at the request of the state its marketing arm gave the state a ''helping hand'' by buying power from suppliers not willing to sell to the state and then reselling the power to the state. ??''We've done the state a tremendous service in purchasing power on its behalf'' said Randy Harrison Mirant's Western chief executive officer ''and it's wrong for the transactions to be misinterpreted and skewed in a negative light.'' ??Mirant said its subsidiaries generated 1.377 million megawatt-hours in April while its marketing arm purchased enough additional electricity to boost the total sold to the state during the month to 2.077 million megawatt-hours. ??The firm said the power was sold for an average of $256.87 per megawatt-hour. That's below the $346 average that the state expects to pay on the expensive spot market during the second quarter of this year from April through June. ??But it's well above the average price of $69 per megawatt-hour said to have been obtained in the first round of long-term contracts negotiated by the state. ??Mirant purchased three power plants from PG&E capable of producing 3000 megawatts during a controversial part of deregulation. The state Public Utilities Commission ordered utilities to sell off at least half of their fossil-fuel power plants without requiring the purchasers to provide low-cost power to California. ??The utilities sold nearly two dozen major power plants capable of producing more than 20000 megawatts. The largest group of plants 4700 megawatts went to AES Corp. of Virginia. Three Texas firms purchased plants producing 7000 megawatts. ??The power supply situation in California remained sound enough yesterday to ward off blackouts although temperatures are on the rise throughout the state. More heat means more air conditioning and a greater strain on the system. ??But starting next month the state's electricity grid managers plan to provide businesses and consumers with better forecasts of potential rolling blackouts. ??The California Independent System Operator will post on its Web site ''power warnings'' when there is at least a 50 percent chance that rolling blackouts might be required during the next 24 hours. The ISO will issue a ''power watch'' when less-critical shortages are anticipated in advance of high demand days. ??The agency also plans to give a 30-minute warning before it orders utilities to cut power to customers posting information about probable interruptions on its Web site. Its Web site address is www.caiso.com. ??''There have been a number of requests from businesses and consumers alike that would like more advance notice and to be able to plan better. That's what we are trying to do'' ISO spokeswoman Lorie O'Donley said. ??O'Donley said many details about how notifications will occur still have to be worked out including whether e-mails or pagers might be used. ??In other developments in the electricity crisis: ???About 1.5 million compact fluorescent light bulbs will be distributed to 375000 households as part of the ''Power Walk'' program that began during the weekend. Members of the California Conservation Corps are going door-to-door in parts of some cities to distribute the bulbs as part of a $20 million conservation program. ???Republican legislative leaders sent Davis a letter criticizing the governor for using taxpayer funds to hire two aides to former Vice President Al Gore as communication consultants for $30000 a month. The Republicans said Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane operate ''a partisan cut-throat political communications firm.'' ???The state auditor general said in a report on energy deregulation that the state is not meeting some of its goals for conservation and for building new power plants. The auditor also said the PUC does not have a process for quickly approving new transmission lines. The state has been importing about 20 percent of its power.

Rose DATELINE: SAN DIEGO BODY: ??San Dieg Gas and Electric's commercial customers are attacking the prospect of paying an average of 29 percent more to cover the state's soaring cost of buying electricity. ??At a California Public Utilities Commission hearing in San Diego yesterday some business customers also noted the irony that only in February did they win the same rate freeze as residential customers. ??''We need rates we can depend on'' said John Roberts who owns an irrigation products business in San Marcos. ??SDG&E customers were the first to bear the brunt of deregulation and the utility's residential ratepayers were the first to win a reprieve when the state passed a 6.5-cent per kilowatt hour cap. ??The SDG&E cap is expected to end for all customers in the coming weeks as the commission moves to increase SDG&E's rates to levels now paid by customers of PG&E and Edison which are about 3 cents per kilowatt hour higher. ??Yesterday's hearing however was for commercial rates. ??Roberts said his San Marcos-based irrigation products company has withstood a tripling of power costs over the past year while having to cut the cost of its products because of competition he said. ??Roberts added that socking businesses with high costs in order to spare residential electricity customers from expected rate hikes could be counterproductive. ??''If businesses leave the state they'll be without jobs and a $30 savings on their power bills won't mean much'' Roberts said. ??The hearing at the County Administration Building was attended by about 30 people. An additional hearing is scheduled at 7 p.m. today in the Community Rooms at the Oceanside Civic Center 330 N. Coast Highway. ??Larger crowds are expected for hearings on residential rate increases.

Gray Davis has one major political goal: running for president of the United States. His recent hiring of two--not one--political aides to be paid for by the taxpayers at a monthly rate more than double the salary of the governor means that Davis has decided that the California taxpayer will pay through the nose to support this goal. ??These consultants are not experts in the energy area which is the biggest problem facing California today but are experienced spin doctors brought in to try to improve the diving image of Davis. I have no problem with the governor bringing in these men at his own expense but for the taxpayer to foot the bill is bordering on criminal. ??Jack Bendar ???o7 Pacific Palisades ???f7 * ??Is anyone as outraged as I am over Davis hiring at California taxpayers' expense damage-control experts to cover his lack of energy policy leadership? The fee of $30000 per month is outrageous and is an insult to citizens.

Davis has the power generating companies. But as Pogo said We have met the enemy and he is us. If Davis and his cronies in the Legislature had the courage to allow retail electricity prices to rise businesses and individuals would have a financial incentive to conserve. ??If Davis and his cronies had had the wisdom to foresee the huge capacity shortfall looming perhaps California wouldn't have wasted the last decade without bringing even one new power plant online.

Gray Davis' decision to spend $30000 a month in taxpayer money to retain communications consultants known for their highly partisan work. ??Labeling consultants Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane as cut-throat Senate GOP leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga and Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks said in a letter to Davis that the hiring undermines the assertions you have made both publicly and privately throughout this crisis. ??Davis announced Friday that he retained the duo and that the state will pay them a combined $30000 a month for at least the next six months. ??We're not going to support the hiring of political hacks on government payroll Brulte said in an interview. Lehane and Fabiani are very talented. The issue is which payroll is appropriate. . . . These are political opposition research attack dogs. If the governor wants them he ought to pay for them with his $30-million political war chest. ??Some consumer advocates also criticized the move citing the consultants' work on behalf of Southern California Edison. In their private consulting business Fabiani and Lehane are working to win over public and political support for Davis' $3.5-billion plan to rescue Edison from its financial difficulties. Legislation embodying aspects of the deal is pending in Sacramento. ??On Monday Brulte and Cox also complained about the consultants' dual role. ??California taxpayers should not be asked to finance political consultants or individuals who have a vested business interest with the state the letter said. ??Fabiani and Lehane had worked in the Clinton administration and in Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign where they gained a reputation as attack-oriented operatives. Lehane on Monday defended the governor's decision to use tax money to pay their fees saying government often hires outside experts and that he and Fabiani will serve as communications advisors to help the governor fight against these generators. ??The Republicans Lehane added ought to be spending time writing letters to George W. Bush to get him to stop the Texas generators from gouging California. . . . That is the real issue here. ??Davis meanwhile returned to California on Monday after a weekend of fund-raisers. He was in Texas on Saturday for a Dallas event that had been scheduled for April 11. It was postponed when Pacific Gas & Electric filed for bankruptcy protection. ??There is a very large fund-raising base for Democrats in Texas Davis' campaign strategist Garry South said of the state that is home to some of the generators that Davis has criticized. ??Davis traveled to Chicago for another fund-raiser Sunday then met Monday with city officials to discuss how Chicago deals with electrical blackouts. ??After blackouts crippled downtown Chicago in the summer of 1999 Mayor Richard M. Daley demanded that the city's electricity provider Commonwealth Edison give advance notice of power cuts. Customers now sometimes receive warnings two or three days in advance. ??Davis emerged from the meeting saying the utilities have got to tell us in advance when they're going to have a planned blackout. ??It was not however readily apparent how Chicago's solutions would translate to California because its electrical problems are vastly different. Rather than suffering a shortage of electricity throughout the grid like California Chicago has the more microcosmic ills of an aging system--an obsolete transformer going down for example leaving several city blocks in the dark until workers can fix it. ??* ??Times staff writer Eric Slater contributed to this story.

BYLINE: DAN MORAIN TIMES STAFF WRITER DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Legislative Democrats today will sue federal energy regulators charging that their inaction threatens elderly people in nursing homes children in day care centers law enforcement and its ability to fight crime and the state's drinking water supplies. ??Rather than focus on record wholesale energy costs the lawsuit takes a new tack homing in on the threat to health and safety posed by California's energy crisis and the blackouts likely this summer. ??A draft of the suit seeks to force the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to set just and reasonable wholesale power rates as a way of ending the crisis before blackouts occur. The action is being filed by veteran trial attorney Joe Cotchett on behalf of Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco) Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks) and the city of Oakland. ??A crisis of unprecedented dimensions is already taking shape in California the draft says. The public health safety and welfare of the state's 34 million residents is in jeopardy due to the tragic consequences of rolling blackouts and punitive prices. ??Suit Says Blackouts Pose Threats ??Until now most California officials including Gov. Gray Davis have been urging that the regulatory commission cap wholesale power prices as a way of limiting costs to the state which has spent more than $6 billion buying electricity since January. ??In the lawsuit Cotchett will be arguing that while higher bills will stretch the budgets of people on fixed incomes frail elderly people are left to wonder if their oxygen tanks drip IVs dialysis machines and electricity-powered therapeutic beds will respond when they are needed. ??Rolling blackouts represent more than just an annoyance for the men women and children with disabilities the suit says. They represent an imminent threat to life health and independence. ??Cotchett said the suit will be filed in the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco bypassing the federal trial court. Cotchett said the circuit court has direct jurisdiction over FERC. ??Joining Cotchett will be Clark Kelso a professor at McGeorge Law School in Sacramento who briefly was insurance commissioner last year after Chuck Quackenbush resigned. Kelso said he initially was skeptical that lawmakers had legal standing to sue. But after Cotchett spoke with him Kelso said he became convinced the suit had merit. ??Let's face it said Kelso a Republican this is the single most important issue that the state faces for the next six months. ??Watching the Water Supply ??The suit cites warnings from governmental agencies about the implications of blackouts including one the state Department of Health Services issued earlier this month to public water agencies statewide. The warning contains a sample notice that local water authorities should give to consumers. ??If the water looks cloudy or dirty the warning says you should not drink it. The warning suggests that if people are concerned about water quality they can boil it or add eight drops of household bleach to one gallon of water and let it sit for 30 minutes. ??Most water agencies have back-up generators. But the suit says that if an agency's water treatment facilities are hit by a power outage a two-hour blackout can result in two-day interruptions in providing safe drinking water because of time needed to bring equipment back online and flush potentially contaminated water from the system.

BYLINE: MIGUEL BUSTILLO NANCY VOGEL TIMES STAFF WRITERS DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Californians will hear an expanded forecast on their morning commutes this summer courtesy of the energy crisis: The 405 Freeway is jammed there's a slim chance of showers and oh by the way there's a 50% likelihood of blackouts. ??By the end of this month the California Independent System Operator the agency that manages the state's power grid expects to issue 24-hour forecasts generally detailing when and where blackouts can be expected. ??It is also piecing together a high-tech system to give businesses government officials and the public at least a half-hour notice of a probable blackout in their area. ??Just how those notices will be issued remains somewhat up in the air but Cal-ISO is talking with private companies capable of notifying more than 10000 customers a minute via fax and phone and millions a minute via wireless communications such as pagers. ??Cal-ISO assembled the plan after complaints from businesses particularly those in the Silicon Valley that last-minute blackouts were costing California millions. The plan also responds to growing political pressure for the public to be kept informed of the barrage of outages that is expected to darken the state this summer because of insufficient supplies of electricity. ??If Californians' electricity use pattern is similar to last year's Cal-ISO has projected the state could suffer 34 days of blackouts making increased notification crucial. ??With a shortage of hydroelectric power imports from the drought-stricken Pacific Northwest and no new power plants coming online until July the agency calculates that there will be a supply-demand gap in June of 3700 megawatts--enough power to supply 2.8 million homes. A national utility industry group painted a more dire scenario last week when it predicted that California will experience up to 260 hours of blackouts this summer. ??The weather report and traffic report are good analogies people know they are not 100% accurate but if [a blackout] really means a lot to them they will check in said Mike Florio of the Utility Reform Network who serves on the Cal-ISO board. ??Details remain sketchy and the programs may be altered when the board meets Thursday. But a Web page called Today's Outlook on the agency's Internet site http://www.caiso.com will be created to illustrate hour by hour how much electricity is available during a 24-hour period and whether there is a predicted surplus or shortfall. ??Media outreach will be expanded to provide news bulletins on electricity conditions a day in advance. They will not only include demand projections and the effects of weather but they also will define the level of emergency that is expected. ??A power watch will be sounded during stage 1 and stage 2 shortages and a more serious power warning if there is a 50-50 chance of a stage 3 which often results in blackouts. (Stage 1 emergencies occur when power reserves drop below 7% stage 2 5% and stage 3 1.5%.) ??Most important Cal-ISO is pledging to provide 30-minute notice of probable blackouts to people in the areas served by Pacific Gas & Electric Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric among others. In addition to giving the warnings on the Internet and through the mass media Cal-ISO will sound alarms to select e-mail addresses and pager numbers on blast lists or massive computer databases that it will assemble. ??The technology is there. This is a war California is in and we should be deploying high-tech solutions said Carl Guardino of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group the Cal-ISO board member who had been pushing hardest for better notification. Every time California goes black the economy sees red. ??Guardino said that businesses and public agencies are now receiving just two- to six-minute warnings before blackouts not nearly enough to react. ??A two-minute warning may be sufficient in a football game but it is insufficient to protect California businesses and the public he said. ??Though businesses and government agencies are expected to make the most of the warnings Florio said residents also will benefit. ??It will be more of a challenge to get the information to individual homeowners but if someone works at home and sets it up to get an e-mail notice they can take advantage he said. ??In other energy news Monday the woman in charge of paying California's power bills warned that a $13.4-billion bond issue to cover electricity purchases will be insufficient and that the state will have to borrow $4 billion more before it runs out of cash in February. ??Calling a news conference in the capital state Controller Kathleen Connell questioned the key assumptions underpinning Gov. Gray Davis' financial plan for overcoming the energy crisis. The plan assumes the $13.4 billion in bond sales will repay state coffers for electricity purchases and cover future power buys for the next two years. ??Connell's opinion is notable because as the state's chief check writer the independently elected Democrat is privy to information about the prices the state is paying for electricity bought on the spot market and through long-term contracts--data that Davis has largely kept secret. ??Davis' advisors and Department of Finance officials dispute Connell's warnings.

Long commutes. Mediocre schools. Housing costs. At the Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area the Valley's answer to Central Park such ordinary concerns about money time and resources stretched too thin for comfort tumbled out again and again during interviews with some two dozen people visiting this green oasis. ??Sprawling northwest from the tangled junction of the San Diego and Ventura freeways the recreation area is a pastoral patchwork of three golf courses bracketed by Woodley Avenue Park to the east and Lake Balboa to the west. It hardly looks like a battleground but the 2000-acre park straddles something of a political fault line in the mayoral contest. ??Both candidates in the June 5 runoff former state legislator Antonio Villaraigosa and City Atty. James K. Hahn have staked out the Valley as prime campaign turf packed with thousands of up-for-grabs voters whose affections might well tip the race. ??And the Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area is wedged between an electoral no man's land--a southern ribbon of the Valley where about 60% of voters shunned both men in the election's first round--and a central Valley region where Villaraigosa took first place in April beating Hahn by roughly a 2-to-1 margin. ??Between them the candidates are expected to spend more than $10 million by election day to get their messages out. But it's not clear whether these impassioned appeals are reaching their intended targets. ??Less than a month before the election many people here are preoccupied with concerns that have little to do with City Hall. And when they do voice interest in local matters some seem unable to connect these issues to a candidate. ??For instance several Valley voters interviewed in the park in early May said that knotted traffic on the San Diego Freeway was a major problem. But no one mentioned a plan Villaraigosa unveiled in March to buy hundreds of new buses and slash fares in a sweeping bid to cut vehicle traffic or a proposal from Hahn to add more carpool lanes on freeways. ??Which raises a fundamental challenge for would-be mayors: Sometimes there's just too much going on in everyday life to tune in to city politics. I know I ought to many people confess sheepishly but I just haven't gotten around to it yet. ??Take Randye Sandel 58 a blond and bespectacled oil painter from Valley Village. Sandel said she plans to vote for Hahn a known quantity in City Hall but a moment later admits that she might change her mind. The thing is Sandel adds she's been really busy setting up an art exhibition at a Santa Monica gallery and has yet to research her mayoral options. I've been totally immersed in my own life she said. ??Same goes for Harold Seay a muscular golfer heading back to his car after playing 18 holes. The 44-year-old music teacher from Encino said he's had his hands full for weeks rehearsing graduation recitals for a Brentwood private school. The news is the last thing I'm paying attention to he said. ??But both voters can easily rattle off their most pressing concerns. Sandel who used to teach art at Valley College said she is particularly worried about education. ??The last few semesters I taught I was horrified by the academic preparedness of the students. They were practically illiterate she said. They couldn't take notes from my lecture because they didn't understand the vocabulary. That bothers me a lot. Who's going to inherit this country? ??Seay who recently moved to Los Angeles from Miami said he is troubled by the air pollution and racial tension he has encountered here. Seay is African American and his wife is Italian he said and their 9-year-old daughter is stuck half-and-half caught in what Seay regards as a troubling black-white divide. That black-white thing really turns me off he said. I care about people getting along. ??As the mayoral race hurtles into its final weeks some of Hahn and Villaraigosa's most spirited skirmishes have erupted over crime and law enforcement issues. Each man is trying to burnish his own crime-fighting credentials while accusing his rival of neglecting public safety. ??The candidates have squabbled especially fiercely over compressed work schedules for police officers--the notion of squashing the police workweek into three 12-hour days or possibly four 10-hour days. The Police Protective League endorsed Hahn who supports the so-called 3-12 schedule favored by the union. Villaraigosa whom Hahn has often characterized as soft on crime seized upon the scheduling issue to retaliate arguing that the three-day week would jeopardize public safety. ??But interviews with people visiting the Valley's biggest park revealed that crime--which has declined significantly since Mayor Richard Riordan took office eight years ago--was not the main issue weighing on these voters' minds. That distinction belongs to something that has walloped wallets far and wide across this car-addled city: the soaring price of gasoline. ??As he cooled down after a six-mile run near Balboa Lake Ray Verdugo summed up the problem facing many gas-guzzlers as prices approached $2 a gallon: I made a big mistake and bought a big SUV lamented the retired Rocketdyne engineer from Winnetka. I'm on a fixed income and [gasoline prices] keep going up all the time. ??Big-city mayors to be sure wield minimal influence over gasoline pumps. Gas prices are swayed by market forces including the international cost of crude oil rising demand and limited refinery capacity. Nonetheless about a third of voters interviewed as they ambled around the Sepulveda Basin named gas prices as a top concern. Half as many said they were worried about crime. ??Some voters said they were troubled by California's electricity woes although Los Angeles residents have been spared shortages and blackouts because the city's municipal utility avoided deregulation. ??I think building more power plants would help said Julie Erickson 27 a figure-skating instructor from Reseda. ??And then there are the things that people aren't talking about. Nobody (at least nobody in an admittedly unscientific sample of voters culled over two days in the Sepulveda Basin) mentioned the Rampart police scandal or the recruiting problems crippling the Los Angeles Police Department. ??No one uttered so much as a peep about neighborhood councils that much-ballyhooed innovation of the new city charter. Even the Valley secession movement--which Villaraigosa has pointed to as the biggest challenge facing Los Angeles--hardly earned an honorable mention from this cross-section of Valleyites. Only one voter referred to secession at all saying that she favored it. ??Instead many people voiced personal gripes the kind of woes unlikely to vault to the center of the mayoral radar screen--but issues that nonetheless embody the high quality of life both candidates envision for Los Angeles. ??One man a sunburned golfer who lives in Van Nuys said he's dismayed that the city hasn't finished building a new golf clubhouse and restaurant at the Woodley Lakes Golf Course. Another frequent park visitor a retired housekeeper from Sherman Oaks complained about the windblown litter she sees as she walks her dog around Balboa Lake. ??But some problems vexing these voters seem frankly beyond the grasp of even the most poll-tested candidate. ??Sandel the oil painter got downright metaphysical after a good 15 minutes spent mulling the troubles facing Los Angeles and indeed the world. Technology she concluded was advancing so rapidly that it was crowding out humanity's intuitive spiritual side. ??I think there's an extraordinary sense of collective despair and psychological uncertainty smoldering just below the surface she said. I don't know what City Hall can do about that. GRAPHIC: PHOTO: Ray Verdugo a retired Rocketdyne engineer says I'm on a fixed income and [gas prices] keep going up all the time.

The agency also promised to give 30 minutes' warning before it orders utility companies to pull the plug on homes and businesses a move that could prevent traffic accidents stuck elevators and costly shutdowns at factories. ??Up to now the agency has refused to give more than a few minutes' warning saying it did not want to alarm people when there was still a chance that a last-minute purchase of power could stave off blackouts. The utility companies also have resisted giving warnings saying they did not want to tip off burglars and other criminals. ??People are asking for additional notice so we're doing our best to make that a reality said Lorie O'Donley a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator. ??The state's power system crippled by a botched effort at deregulation has been unable to produce or buy enough electricity to power air conditioners on hot days. The rolling blackouts move from neighborhood to neighborhood in a sequence that is determined by the utility companies and is difficult for the public to predict. The outages last 60 to 90 minutes and then skip to another neighborhood. ??Because of the lack of notice the six days of rolling blackouts so far this year have led to pileups at intersections suddenly left without stoplights people trapped in elevators and losses caused by stopped production lines. People with home medical equipment fret that they will be cut off without warning. ??The new plan borrows from the language of weather forecasters: Beginning May 30 the ISO will issue a power watch or power warning that will give notice the grid could be headed toward blackouts. It will issue a 30-minute warning to the media and others before any blackouts begin but will not say what neighborhoods will be hit. ??Any time is better than none said Bill Dombrowski president of the California Retailers Association.

Joe Dunn D-Santa Ana (Orange County) who heads a special committee reviewing energy prices called the ramping allegations first disclosed in The Chronicle on Sunday outrageous acts of manipulation. ???Dunn said that even if the practices did not violate current law legislation could be drafted to make such acts illegal in the future. ???We're looking at it yes from the point of view of civil or criminal statutes that may exist but also whether legislation should be introduced to render it a violation for future such acts. ???Dunn's committee already has been investigating charges that power generators gamed the wholesale energy market to boost their profits. ???The Chronicle reported Sunday that power companies used a complex tactic to alter the output of their plants sometimes several times within an hour. ???Sources who work in the plants said the ploy enabled the companies to drive up the prices they receive for electricity. The firms avoided detection by still meeting the terms of their contracts which required them to supply a certain amount of power each hour. The sources said the tactic greatly contributed to deteriorating physical conditions at the plants leading to the record level of outages now plaguing California plants. ???The senate committee which convened in March after The Chronicle reported that power companies had overstated the growth in demand for electricity in California has obtained confidential bidding and generation data for power-generating companies. Dunn said the data will be analyzed to determine which plants employed the ramping tactic. He added that the issue would be examined in a public hearing in the coming weeks. ???Meanwhile pressure continued to mount on generating companies that drove electricity supplies through the roof during the past year. ???Sources said the California Public Utilities Commission which is investigating allegedly unnecessary plant shutdowns has narrowed its focus. It is targeting several plants that had no apparent defects yet went offline during periods when prices were rising because of limited electricity supplies. ???Commissioner Jeff Brown said the names of these plants are under court seal. However Dow Jones reported yesterday that one of them was a San Diego-area plant co-owned by Dynegy Inc. of Houston and NRG Inc. of Minneapolis. Another was a Pittsburg plant owned by Mirant Corp. of Atlanta. The companies denied the allegations. ???On another front Sen. John Burton D-San Francisco and Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg D-Sherman Oaks (Los Angeles County) were expected to file a lawsuit this morning against the Federal Energy Regulatory Committee for failing to carry out its stated duty of ensuring just and reasonable electricity rates. ???Their central failing is that they don't follow the law Burton said in an interview.

A1 LENGTH: 1527 words HEADLINE: Half-hour notice of blackouts planned FAST ALERTS: Power grid operator may send voice e-mail messages SOURCE: Chronicle Sacramento Bureau BYLINE: Lynda Gledhill DATELINE: Sacramento BODY: Californians will receive 30 minutes' warning that blackouts may be imposed -- enough time it is hoped to get out of the elevator or through a dangerous intersection the state's power grid managers said yesterday. ???The California Independent System Operator also will provide a daily power forecast 24 hours in advance so residents and businesses can plan for blackouts the same way people prepare for severe storms. ???We want a system that is proactive said Carl Guardino an ISO board member and president of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group. When the last few rolling blackouts hit there was as little as two minutes' warning. Two minutes may be fine in a football game but it's not fine for California's economy or safety. ???ISO officials also said they are examining high-tech ways of quickly spreading the word about impending blackouts to homeowners and businesses through mass e-mails faxes automated phone calls and pager messages. ???The plan detailed in a report issued yesterday still falls far short of other proposals being pushed in the Legislature. Lawmakers have suggested scheduling blackout days months in advance and having California join with other Western states to form a buyer's cartel that would refuse to pay for power when prices become too high. ???It's not the report I was expecting but 30 minutes of notice is certainly better than two said Sen. Debra Bowen D-Marina del Ray. No matter how you slice it this summer is going to be miserable. The question is whether we want to have planned misery or unplanned misery. ???A spokesman for the California Manufacturers and Technology Association which commissioned a recent report that found unplanned blackouts could cost the state economy $21.8 billion said the ISO policy changes will be a tremendous help to many businesses. ???In this electrically unreliable world any notification manufacturers can get is good said Gino DeCaro a spokesman for the association. While 30 minutes won't be enough for some for most manufacturers it will be sufficient. The ISO will wait for guidance from the governor and lawmakers regarding more complicated issues such as the creation of scheduled blackouts said Michael Florio an ISO board member and official at The Utility Reform Network. ???There are bigger public policy ramifications Florio said. ???The ideas will be discussed in greater detail at an ISO board meeting Thursday. Stephanie McCorkle an ISO spokeswoman said the changes are just updates of policies already in place. ???WARNING OF 'PROBABLE' BLACKOUTS ???The 30-minute advance-notification system scheduled to go into effect early next month would warn of probable blackouts including the amount of load that will have to be curtailed in each service area. ???Until now the agency has refused to give more than a few minutes' warning saying it did not want to alarm people when there was still a chance that a last-minute purchase of power could stave off blackouts. The utilities also have resisted giving warnings saying they did not want to tip off burglars and other criminals. ???The ISO also has been working to upgrade its Web site to provide the most current information about how much electricity is being used and how much is available. It will also establish a system this summer through which that information can be sent in an hourly e-mail. ???This information may make it easier for larger users of electricity to plan their operations said ISO spokeswoman Lorie O'Donley. ???Also planned by the ISO is a Power Watch/Power Warning system that would provide a 24-hour notice of high-demand days. ???Under the two-tiered system a Power Watch would be declared whenever a Stage One or Stage Two alert is likely while a Power Warning would be issued whenever there is at least a 50 percent chance of a Stage Three alert. ???With one report suggesting California may see as many as 700 hours of rolling blackouts this summer lawmakers are hard at work trying to find ways to make the outages easier for power customers to cope with. ???The idea of a buyer's cartel the subject of a Capitol hearing today would have California -- in partnership with other states -- set a firm ceiling on what it will pay power producers for electricity this summer -- and not one dime more. ???The idea which has attracted the support of some key lawmakers and the cautious interest of Gov. Gray Davis could potentially curtail the exorbitantly high prices the state has been paying for electricity. ???The trade-off would be the likelihood of more frequent blackouts than if the state continues to pay any price electricity sellers demand. ???The maximum the state would pay would be set by a formula based on such things as the cost of natural gas. A reasonable profit for power producers would be built in supporters said. ???DESIGNATING BLACKOUT DAYS ???Meanwhile Assemblyman Mike Briggs R-Fresno will introduce a bill today that would require the state's utilities and Public Utilities Commission to designate days for potential blackouts to each block. ???For example a customer located in Block 3 of Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s service area could be told in advance that power will be turned off June 5 if blackouts are needed that day. ???Right now every day is a potential blackout day Briggs said. This way people would know when their potential days are. ??On alert ???-- When demand is high the ISO will forecast peak demand power supply and weather 24 hours in advance. ???-- A power watch will be issued when it is likely the grid will reach Stage 1 (system is within 7% of running out of power) or Stage 2 (system is within 5% of running out of power). ???-- A power warning will be issued when there is at least a 50% chance of a Stage 3 alert (demand is within 1.5% of supply). ???Who calls a blackout? ???Engineers in Folsom at the Independent System Operator keep watch on the state's power consumption. When they determine that energy reserves have dipped below 1.5 percent of available capacity the ISO can order utilities to start cutting juice. Officials said this week they would give 30 minutes' notice before blackouts begin. The ISO tells the utilities exactly how much power to cut. ???Q: Who decides who gets blacked out and for how long? ???A: That's up to the utilities. PG&E has divided its 4.5 million customers into 14 blocks each block is darkened for one to two hours at a time. The blocks are defined by PG&E's network of circuits rather than by geography. Thus neighborhoods in San Francisco Oakland and Pleasant Hill can be blacked out simultaneously. ???Q: How many users are blacked out at once? ???A: Each of PG&E's 14 ???blocks represents about 550 megawatts of electricity. (A megawatt is enough electricity to power 1000 homes.) If PG&E is told to cut more than 550 megawatts it can shut down two or more blocks at a time. PG&E also can black out smaller portions within each block if the ISO's requirements are for less than 550 megawatts. ???Q: How is power shut off? ???A: This is a straightforward matter of shutting off circuits in a power substation by computer or sending a crew to flip the switches by hand. ???Q: How many days of blackouts have we had this year and how many customers have been affected? ???A: A total of 3035000 customers have been blacked out in the six days of rolling blackouts since Jan. 1 2001. ???Q: Which block of customers will be blacked out next? ???A: Some or all customers in Block 1. ???Q: How do I know what block I'm in? ???A: Look for the words Rotating Outage Block followed by a number on your bill. If it says Block 50 you share an electrical circuit with a hospital police station or other essential service that is normally exempt from service cuts. ???Q: What should I do when the lights go out? ???A: Power experts advise: ???-- Turn off all lights and appliances to prevent damage-causing power surges when service is restored. Leave one light on to indicate when the electricity is back. ???-- Use caution when driving because traffic signals may be out. Treat all intersections as a four-way stop. ???-- To protect food open refrigerator and freezer doors only when absolutely necessary. ???-- Keep a flashlight and radio with fresh batteries available. If you light candles observe the usual safety precautions. ???-- If the lights go out check with neighbors to determine if only your home is affected. It may be a downed power line or some other problem in which case you should alert PG&E or your city electrical bureau. ???-- When the power returns turn on one appliance at a time to prevent power surges. ???-- Don't plug a generator into the wall when the lights return it can send a high-voltage current through the system that can electrocute power workers. ???-- Tell children who are home alone to remain calm to turn off the TV and computers and not to use candles. ???Sources: PG&E Chronicle staff ???Chronicle Graphic ??E-mail Lynda Gledhill at lgledhill@sfchronicle.com.

And he's got to stop looking so cozy with business. ??The president's proposal emphasizes stepped-up production and modest conservation measures. It received mixed reviews from an anxious public that appears to want quick relief but sees the plan only helping after several years. ??Although Bush says his program will allow Americans to retain the lifestyle they are accustomed to only 30% of those surveyed said they believe it. Two of three said major lifestyle changes will be necessary to solve the nation's energy woes. ??Nearly half said the Bush plan would not do enough to conserve energy and 43% said the plan would do too little to increase production. ??Americans also were split over the Bush proposal to increase the number of nuclear power plants to generate electricity: 49% for and 46% against. ??The tepid response to the Bush energy plan might have been a factor in raising his job-disapproval rating from 31% a week ago to 36% now the highest of his presidency. His 56% job-approval rating did not change from a week ago. ??Bush's strongest disapproval came from Democrats low-income earners women under 50 and residents of California a state wrestling with electricity shortages. ??California Democratic Gov. Gray Davis was highly critical of the Bush plan. He said it does nothing to address the astronomical run-up in the prices of electricity natural gas and gasoline (and) favors more energy production at the expense of everything else. ??White House spokesman Claire Buchan said the president will continue to press his plan regardless of the polls: The president does not govern by polls. This is a serious issue that has been neglected for years and he has begun a serious dialogue with the American people. It will continue. ??Most poll respondents said they see threats of electricity shortages and the rising price of gasoline and heating fuels as serious problems although only 12% said they see a state of crisis. And most of those polled said Bush is not doing enough to address those problems. ??At the same time most said energy companies have too much influence over the administration's energy polices an argument Democrats raise. ??One in five said the Bush administration deserves a great deal of blame for the energy problems 28% put a great deal of that blame on the Clinton administration.

Maybe that is the reason for his optimism: the north and the south Alaska to Patagonia extend farther suggest a future wider than the American future bounded by coastlines. ??Along with his far northern ambition for the Alaskan wilderness Mr. Bush has broached with the Mexican president Vicente Fox the possibility of building power plants in Mexico for American consumers north of the border. Such schemes reveal him to be perhaps a visionary as much as he seems a man oblivious of the lessons John Muir discovered in California. ??Which is only to say there is a wisdom in the way the Texan sees our American future. ?There is also a wisdom to the way Californians understand that future. ??FRANK LEADS CHARGE ??A group of 22 House Democrats yesterday sent a letter to all U.S. senators urging them to delay the confirmation of solicitor general candidate Theodore Olson until he gives a full and honest accounting of his role in a magazine's investigations of former President Bill Clinton. ??As members of various House committees with jurisdiction over the investigations that resulted from accusations of wrongdoing against President Clinton we became very familiar with the quality of these accusations they wrote. ?To our disappointment we found that there was a consistent pattern . . . of ideological opponents of the president making irresponsible unfounded and often scurrilous charges. ??Led by Rep. ?Barney Frank Massachusetts Democrat the group is asking senators to defeat Mr. ?Olson's nomination if it turns out that he was deeply involved in this disinformation campaign. ??Mr. ?Olson has told the Senate Judiciary Committee that as a member of the American Spectator's board of directors he learned of the magazine's so-called Arkansas Project in mid-1997. He has said he did not take an active role in the investigative project. ??The panel voted 9-9 on party lines last week on Mr. ?Olson's nomination and Senate Democrats are demanding more documents and information about his involvement with the magazine before a floor vote on the nomination. ??BUSH COURTS RIORDAN ??Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan a Republican serving his final days in that office may run for governor against incumbent Democrat Gray Davis in 2002 National Journal reports. ??You can say I'm giving it serious thought Mr. ?Riordan said in an interview with the magazine. ??Previously the 71-year-old Mr. ?Riordan had expressed support for Los Angeles investment banker William E. ?Simon Jr. who has been readying his candidacy for the Republican nomination. ?But that was before a May 1 phone call from President Bush in which the president wished the mayor a happy birthday - and urged him to think about the governorship. ??I think he sees this as a chance to revive the party and the president was extremely encouraging and very persuasive Mr. ?Riordan said. ?As you know the Republican Party in California has been an endangered species now for several years. ??BUSH BETTERS DAVIS ??California Gov. ?Gray Davis blames President Bush for his state's electricity woes but a new survey finds that Californians have a higher opinion of the president than of their governor. ??Only 46 percent of 2001 respondents in a poll conducted by the Public Policy Institute of California gave Mr. ?Davis a positive job-approval rating down from 63 percent in January. ?And only 29 percent of those polled approved of the way the Democrat is handling the electricity crisis. Sixty percent disapprove. ??Mr. ?Bush on the other hand had a 57 percent job-approval rating with 36 percent disapproving. ?Thirty-three percent approved of his handling of the electricity problem while 56 percent disapproved. ??HIS BETTER HALF ??June's Talk magazine recalls the relationship of President Johnson and his wife Lady Bird who was keenly aware that a President might seek out the companionship of other women according to Kati Marton's new book Hidden Power: Presidential Marriages That Shaped Our Recent History. ??If I wanted him to do without the stimulation knowledge or assistance that other women offered him it would after a period have diminished me said Mrs. ?Johnson who had a unique understanding of what she called the 'help and support' of other women according to the book. ??Mrs. ?Johnson managed to keep an eye on LBJ's extramarital liaisons and even learned a thing or two from his mistresses. ?I learned how to dress better from this one to always wear lipstick from another about art or music from another she said. ??It was well-known around the White House that Mr. ?Johnson was a womanizer but such things were kept hidden by the media in those halcyon days. ??Suddenly the President appeared and pulled up a chair recalled one veteran reporter in the book. ?'Now boys let me tell you something. Sometimes you may see me coming out of a room in the White House with a woman. ?You just remember' he said 'that is none of your business.'

The outages last 60 to 90 minutes and then skip to another neighborhood. ??Because of the lack of notice the six days of rolling blackouts to hit the state so far this year have led to pileups at intersections suddenly left without stoplights people trapped in elevators and losses caused by stopped production lines.

However the ISO will not say what neighborhoods will be hit. ??Any time is better than none said Bill Dombrowski president of the California Retailers Association. Obviously we'd like more but we're realistic about what they can do. ??The plan falls far short of what some consumer groups and legislators are demanding. ??State Sen. Debra Bowen has said she envisions giving consumers three to five days' notice that their power will be cut during a particular period so businesses could shut down or shift their operations to non-peak hours such as nights and weekends.

The plant owned by local power wholesaler Pinnacle West Energy will produce enough electricity to serve about 120000 homes though much of it may be sold elsewhere. ??On Monday PG&E National Energy Group a sister of California's financially squeezed PG&E Gas and Electric broke ground for its planned $500 million generating plant west of Phoenix that will use natural gas. ??It's one of up to 11 plants planned for Arizona by out-of-state interests. Three such plants are expected to begin production this summer though much of their power also may be sold to other states. ??That's true of the PG&E National plant too but those who live in the vicinity don't care. ??We have nothing out here now said Elisa Bigbey of Harquahala Valley. We want to get something going. ??The plant will increase the assessed valuation of the area by 17 times and will generate $10.7 million in new property taxes. PG&E already has given the local school district a portable shed in which to store records because the district's only school was damaged by a November fire. ??PG&E also is making a no-strings outright gift to the community of $550000 in 11 annual cash installments. A committee of local residents will decide how to spend the windfall. ??Meanwhile Panda Energy of Dallas and Teco Power Services of Tampa Fla. recently broke ground for a plant south of the PG&E site and Duke Energy North America of Charlotte N.C. and Sempra Energy of San Diego each have started plants in the Arlington Valley. ??Pinnacle West Generating has a plant under construction near the Palo Verde nuclear plant in this same general area. ??Additionally the Desert Basin Plant in Casa Grande is owned by Reliant Energy of Houston. The Griffith Energy Plant near Kingman is owned by Duke Energy and P&L Global. The Southpoint plant set to begin production next month near Bullhead City is owned by Calpine Corp. of San Jose. ??Such plants have come to Arizona because there's lot of space in Arizona water is relatively inexpensive there's access to natural gas regulators are friendly and the plants can be situated at a distance from urban air pollution controls. ??The PG&E plant will produce nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxides that can lead to formation of ozone an air pollution problem against Phoenix has been fighting for years. ??Additionally the plant will use 6500 acre feet of water a year enough to meet the needs of a town of about 30000. PG&E expects to use surplus Central Arizona Project water from the distant Colorado River - but the Harquahala Valley has a good supply of underground water PG&E can tap if the CAP surplus disappears.

The Independent System Operator will also be issuing a daily energy forecast with projected supply and demand and the likelihood of blackouts. Several lawmakers say they'll introduce plans that would give Californians even more notice of blackouts - from one day to one month. ??- The state auditor releases a report on the state's energy crisis saying previous estimates that the state could avoid blackouts this summer are overly optimistic. The Bureau of State Audits also criticized the California Public Utilities Commission saying the commission hasn't responded to the crisis by expediting transmission line project. ??- Gov. Gray Davis is in Chicago speaking with city officials there about blackout procedures. ??- Davis' energy advisers say that the state is meeting its energy goals despite doubts raised by Controller Kathleen Connell and other critics. Connell questioned whether the state can buy enough electricity cheap enough to avoid borrowing more than the $13.4 billion approved by state lawmakers. But Davis adviser Joe Fichera says the state has signed more long-term power contracts that will help keep prices low. ??- Davis' office announces that an eighth peaker power plant has been licensed. The 135-megawatt plant in Gilroy is expected to be online by the end of September. The California Energy Commission says that more than 10000 megawatts of new electricity since April 1999. ??- The California Energy Commission also announces increased rebates for renewable energy systems - such as solar panels fuel cells or small wind generation. Rebates of up to 50 percent on the system are available for residential commercial industrial or agricultural users. ??- Republican legislative leaders criticize Davis for spending tax money on a political communications firm that previously advised Vice President Al Gore. Davis is hiring Gore's former press secretary and deputy campaign manager for six months at $30000 a month to coordinate the governor's communications on energy issues.

PG&E saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state lawmakers filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. ??Electricity and natural gas suppliers scared off by the two companies' poor credit ratings are refusing to sell to them leading the state in January to start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and business customers. The state is also buying power for a third investor-owned utility San Diego Gas & Electric which is in better financial shape than much larger Edison and PG&E but also struggling with high wholesale power costs. ??The Public Utilities Commission has approved average rate increases of 36 percent for residential customers and 38 percent for commercial customers and hikes of up to 49 percent for industrial customers and 15 or 20 percent for agricultural customers to help finance the state's multibillion-dollar power buys.

It is at once a triumph of technology and Western gumption and a reminder of how tenuous it all is. ??The great growth in the West followed a simple recipe: Water plus power equals population. There was always a feeling that the land was so big you couldn't use it up not the resources not the space. ??Today there are signs that's no longer true. In California blackouts. In Oregon and Washington drought. In Arizona arsons to stop construction. And in every rearview mirror more traffic all the time. ??The allure of vast prairies open skies and endless opportunity is what first drew people out West. But as deserts disappear under development possibilities become problems. ??Now with its infrastructure strained by growth the West faces difficult choices: Energy or environment? Freeways or orchards? Water for people or fish? ??We're losing what we've come for this ideal says James Corless California director of the Surface Transportation Policy Project which aims to diversify transportation systems to reduce traffic and pollution caused by growth. And we are loath to change. ??--- ??When the streets went dark in California a light bulb came on across the West. ??The region saw its vulnerability. For one very important resource demand had won out over supply. What about all the others? ??We've got an infrastructure that can't really carry much additional power. We're starting to see the same situation with water says John Maddox president of the Denver-based Center for the New West. ??And people keep coming. ??The West added more than 10 million people in the 1990s making it the fastest-growing region in the United States. In the next decade another 10 million are expected. ??What does that mean? Maddox says. How many new roads new water infrastructure and treatment facilities how many new runways and airports? ??Perhaps more than clogged freeways and periodic droughts the power crisis has brought home the reality that there are limits to growth. ??In California electricity consumption rose 24 percent in the past five years as the economy grew by 29 percent. However no major new plants were built in the state in the past 10 years according to Cambridge Energy Research Associates. ??Several projects to generate new power were shelved in the 1990s because of regulatory red-tape environmental protests economics and wariness over the state's deregulation plan. ??As a result the power ran low and California was forced to go to the open market in search of electricity sending power rates soaring and shutting out the lights in rolling blackouts. ??California officials now predict it will take two to three years before energy production catches up with demand. ??Meanwhile the crisis has crossed state lines. In the Northwest generating capacity grew 4 percent in the 1990s while demand grew 24 percent. That wasn't a problem when abundant rain and snow produced above-average hydropower generation between 1995 and 2000. ??Then drought hit and generation dropped. Washington Oregon Idaho and Montana are about 3000 megawatts short of the electricity they need. ??Now everyone's playing catch-up. California is on a plant-building spree while other states are pushing conservation and looking for alternative fuel sources. ??Even in power-hungry Las Vegas the mega-resorts are cutting back. The MGM Grand refitted its 5000 guest rooms with low-watt fluorescent bulbs and changed its casino-floor lighting. Treasure Island's parking garage is switching to sodium bulbs that use 30 percent less energy. ??But a feeling of dread is gripping some Westerners. If the lights can go out what's next? Dry faucets? ??The thing I worry about is water says Carol Ann Heggie-Hall a retired science teacher who moved from Queens N.Y. to Henderson Nev. in 1999. Is there enough water for everyone and their plants? ??Much of the West is facing the worst drought in a quarter-century prompting warnings of environmental degradation forest fires and agricultural decline. Nevertheless experts say the West isn't in danger of running out of water. The challenge is determining who gets how much. ??It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that if the faucets ran dry in Scottsdale there are places to go to get water says Joe Hunter a power and water specialist at the Center for the New West. But it means shifting it from one use to another. ??About 80 percent of water in most Western states is used to irrigate crops a percentage that could drop if residential supplies were strained Hunter says. ??Western states and cities must also do more to share water. ??California has long used more than its allocation from the Colorado River which supplies drinking water to seven Western states. An agreement allows California to receive surplus water if it implements conservation measures that will reduce its reliance on the river in the future. ??In the meantime Western cities are looking elsewhere to sustain the supply. The Las Vegas Valley predicts it will reach its annual Colorado River allocation by 2007 so its regional water authority is negotiating to store 1.2 million acre feet of water in Arizona for the next 15 years. ??Beyond power and water other infrastructure problems persist. In the Vegas area which added 700000 people in the '90s road closures due to highway expansions are a daily occurrence. ??There are few roads you can drive on that aren't under construction admits Jim Gibson mayor of Henderson a city south of Vegas that is among the country's most rapidly growing communities. ??Without the new roads Vegas transportation officials estimate there would be 2289 miles of congestion by the year 2025 compared with 341 miles last year. ??Highways alleviate congestion but also drive more growth. ??Interstate 5 the north-south freeway through Washington and Oregon became a growth magnet. In Colorado Interstate 70 has opened the mountains to staggering growth west of Denver. ??-- ??In the fastest-growing metro area in the fastest-growing state in the fastest-growing region of the country Greg Cox and Dale Stark are unloading dirt on a Las Vegas street crammed with construction workers. ??The landscapers are a rare breed in a town teeming with newcomers: Cox has lived here all his life Stark moved from Southern California in 1979. ??Both grumble about the changes they've seen and both vow to leave. ??I moved here when this town was nice Stark says. Now you can't drive down the road without getting cut off and flipped off. ??Cox complains he can barely get around at all. A drive across town used to take 20 minutes. Now he grunts You've got to pack a lunch. ??Both agree: Even Las Vegas the city built on the very idea of unlimited resources and space is reaching its limits. ??The sentiment is spreading across the West: Unbridled growth must stop. ??Planning experts insist cities must reinvest in old neighborhoods rather than build new ones and provide incentive to plan for growth in a way that incorporates existing infrastructure. ??Portland Ore. has been a national leader with its urban growth boundary. In San Francisco a program provides federal money to developers who build homes near transit stops. ??Still when initiatives to rein in growth were placed on the ballot in several Western states last November most of the big measures failed - including one in Arizona to force developers to pay for new infrastructure. Opponents warned that growth controls would be bad for business. ??In Las Vegas despite infrastructure challenges the official line remains that growth is good. ??As long as you can take care of the social problems and quality of life problems there's never such a thing as too much growth declares Mayor Oscar Goodman. Once you stop growing you stagnate. ??And so for now the fountains flow the marquees shine. ??And the people keep coming. ??On the Net: ??Center for the New West: www.newwest.org/ ??Sierra Club sprawl campaign: ??Census stats: ??Las Vegas growth topics website: ??Surface Transportation Policy Project: http://www.transact.org/ ??Brookings Institution's Center on Urban and Metropolitan Policy: ??EDITOR'S NOTE - Pauline Arrillaga is the AP's Southwest regional writer based in Phoenix. ??End ADV for May 26-27 GRAPHIC: AP Photos NY372-375 of May 21 AP Graphic WESTERN GROWTH AP LOAD-DATE: May 22 2001 of 85 DOCUMENTS Associated Press The materials in the AP file were compiled by The Associated Press. ?These materials may not be republished without the express written consent of The Associated Press. ????????????????????????May 21 2001 Monday BC cycle SECTION: Domestic News Business News LENGTH: 648 words HEADLINE: California will forecast blackouts and warn the public BYLINE: By JENNIFER COLEMAN Associated Press Writer DATELINE: SACRAMENTO Calif. BODY: ??Californians will soon be waking up to the weather the traffic - and a blackout forecast. ??The operator of the state's electricity grid said Monday it will start issuing forecasts 24 hours ahead of expected rolling blackouts. ??The agency also promised to give 30 minutes' warning before it orders utilities to pull the plug on homes and businesses a move that could prevent traffic accidents stuck elevators and costly shutdowns at factories. ??Up to now the agency has refused to give more than a few minutes' warning saying it did not want to alarm people when there was still a chance that a last-minute purchase of power could stave off blackouts. The utilities have also resisted giving warnings saying they did not want to tip off burglars and other criminals. ??People are asking for additional notice so we're doing our best to make that a reality said Lorie O'Donley a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator. ??Californians have been warned that rolling blackouts could be a regular feature this summer. The state's power system crippled by a botched effort at deregulation has been unable to produce or buy enough electricity to power air conditioners on hot days. ??The rolling blackouts move from neighborhood to neighborhood in a sequence that is determined by the utilities and is difficult or impossible for the public to predict. The outages last 60 to 90 minutes and then skip to another neighborhood. ??Because of the lack of notice the six days of rolling blackouts to hit the state so far this year have led to pileups at intersections suddenly left without stoplights people trapped in elevators and losses caused by stopped production lines. People with home medical equipment like oxygen fret they that they will be cut off without warning. ??The new plan by the ISO borrows from the language of weather forecasters: Beginning May 30 it will issue a power watch or power warning that will give notice the grid could be headed toward blackouts. ??The ISO will issue 30-minute warning to the media and others before any blackouts actually begin. However the ISO will not say what neighborhoods will be hit. ??Any time is better than none said Bill Dombrowski president of the California Retailers Association. Obviously we'd like more but we're realistic about what they can do. ??Assemblyman Fred Keeley the Legislature's point man on energy acknowledged that scheduling blackouts could attract criminals and open the state to legal liability for accidents at blacked-out intersections. ??That is a genuine problem and genuine concern Keeley said earlier. I think we would have to work with local governments so they could have a sufficient advance notice to be able to foresee that and try to deploy their resources appropriately. ??The ISO said it also is looking into high-tech ways it can get word of an impending blackout quickly to homeowners and businesses through mass e-mails faxes automated phone calls and pager messages. ??The plan falls far short of what some consumer groups and legislators are demanding. ??State Sen. Debra Bowen has said she envisions giving consumers three to five days' notice that their power will be cut during a particular period so businesses could shut down or shift their operations to non-peak hours such as nights and weekends. ??State Assemblyman Mike Briggs said he plans to introduce a bill that would have the Public Utilities Commission notify businesses and homeowners as much as one month ahead of time when they would have their power cut. ??We owe the people of this state some kind of schedule Briggs said. If businesses and individuals knew what days their power could potentially be shut off or blacked out they could plan for that blackout accordingly. ??On the Net: ??California Independent System Operator: http://www.caiso.com LOAD-DATE: May 22 2001 of 85 DOCUMENTS Associated Press The materials in the AP file were compiled by The Associated Press. ?These materials may not be republished without the express written consent of The Associated Press. ????????????????????????May 21 2001 Monday BC cycle SECTION: Domestic News LENGTH: 229 words HEADLINE: Survey: Gov.

Gray Davis and the economy has plunged in the face of a statewide energy crisis according to a poll released Monday. ??This crisis and general economic uncertainty have severely undermined public confidence in California's future and in its leaders said Mark Baldassare director of the survey by the Public Policy Institute of California. ??The institute a nonprofit organization that researches economic social and political issues interviewed 2001 adult California residents in English and Spanish between May 1 and May 9.

Forty-four percent believe it is on the right track. ??The poll also found that Californians blame the electric utility companies more than anyone else for the energy crunch. Thirty-two percent said they fault utilities while 26 percent blame former Gov.

And if generators don't lower the price the state should schedule blackouts to cut consumption he said. ??The report by Navarro and the Utility Consumers' Action Network says the state's current method of highly disruptive random rolling blackouts needs to be revamped. ??UCAN suggests that the state be divided into blackout zones that utilities could notify ahead of time that power would be cut at a specific time and for a certain duration. ??Scheduling blackouts could attract criminals to outage areas Keeley acknowledged and possibly could subject the state to legal liability for traffic accidents or other incidents if power is deliberately shut off. ??That is a genuine problem and genuine concern Keeley said. I think we would have to work with local governments so they could have a sufficient advance notice to be able to foresee that and try to deploy their resources appropriately. ??Critics of the planned blackouts said power producers simply could sell their unused electricity to other states or trim back production to keep supplies short. ??Assemblyman Mike Briggs R-Fresno plans to introduce a bill this week that would have the Public Utilities Commission notify businesses and homeowners as much as one month ahead of time when they would have their power cut. ??We owe the people of this state some kind of schedule Briggs said. If businesses and individuals knew what days their power could potentially be shut off or blacked out they could plan for that blackout accordingly. ??The Central Valley Republican said the ability to plan for outages would be especially benefit farmers who need power to irrigate their crops. ??Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg who convened a special subcommittee on blackouts has also suggested the state should consider scheduling daily blackouts to cut the state's power use and drive down prices. Democratic Assembly members plan to introduce their own version of a blackout plan. ??Sen. Debra Bowen D-Marina del Rey has said she envisions giving consumers three to five days notice that their power will be cut during a particular period so businesses could opt to shut down or shift their operations to nonpeak hours such as nights and weekends. ??And by treating blackouts as a first option rather than a last resort the state could cut its peak power needs and drive down prices Bowen said. California power consumers would in essence form a reverse cartel to stop the market manipulation and the price gouging she said. ??The planned blackout suggestions come as state officials grow increasingly concerned that power prices will keep rising this summer even beyond the extraordinary levels the state already has been paying on behalf of three cash-strapped privately owned utilities. ??Gov. Gray Davis said the state paid $1900 per megawatt hour at one point last week. ??The state has dedicated $6.7 billion since mid-January to purchase power for Pacific Gas and Electric Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric. ??Those expenditures will be repaid this summer when the state issues $13.4 billion in revenue bonds. The bonds will be repaid by ratepayers over 15 years. ??--- ??On the Net: ??California Independent System Operator: http://www.caiso.com/ LOAD-DATE: May 22 2001 of 85 DOCUMENTS ???????????????????The Associated Press State & Local Wire The materials in the AP file were compiled by The Associated Press. ?These materials may not be republished without the express written consent of The Associated Press. ????????????????????????May 21 2001 Monday BC cycle SECTION: State and Regional LENGTH: 901 words HEADLINE: 'Baseline' becoming key word for electric customers BYLINE: By KAREN GAUDETTE Associated Press Writer DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO BODY: ??A little calculation on electric bills is fast becoming a big concern for millions of residential customers of California's two largest utilities. ??Sitting near the top of Southern California Edison electric bills and near the bottom of the last page of Pacific Gas and Electric bills is a number called baseline which guarantees a certain amount of electricity at the lowest price utilities charge. ??This number which differs from customer to customer based on a host of factors is the benchmark for determining how much more residents will pay for electricity come June - when the largest rate hikes in California history start showing up on bills. ??Now with deregulation and prices being so much higher it's going to require that people educate themselves about their bills the same way they had to do when long distance telephone service was deregulated said Commissioner Carl Wood of the Public Utilities Commission. ??Under a rate-hike allocation plan approved Tuesday by the PUC everyone who exceeds baseline by more than 30 percent will pay progressively more for that additional electricity - with the heaviest residential users facing a 37 percent average hike on their overall bill translating to an increase of roughly $85 a month. ??State law ensures that residential customers who don't use more than 30 percent above baseline will not face the rate hikes. The PUC figures around half of PG&E and Edison customers now fall into that category. ??But consumer rights groups and even the utilities think the PUC is underestimating residential electric use given the recent proliferation of home computers cell phone chargers and the like. ??They think baseline is set too low for many customers and say families and people who work at home will pay more than their fair share of the rate hikes. ??It's an anti-family action. People with kids have a hard time staying within baseline said Mike Florio senior attorney with The Utility Reform Network. A rate hike of 30 to 40 percent could be 100 percent for people with large households. ??Since 1982 when lawmakers created baseline - given in cents per kilowatt hour per month - to ensure a minimum amount of affordable power and encourage conservation the PUC has determined baseline by dividing the state into climatic and geographic regions. ??PG&E has 10 such regions within its service territory in northern and central California Edison has six in central and southern California. ??The PUC then finds the average amount of electricity use for customers within each region. The baseline quantity is 50 percent to 60 percent of that amount and up to 70 percent of that amount during the winter months if a customer uses only one type of energy (electricity or natural gas). ??Customers who depend on electronic medical equipment such as suction breathing and dialysis machines can apply for a slightly higher baseline. ??A family living in the scorching hot Coachella Valley would have a larger allotment of lower-priced electricity than a family living in breezy Monterey given that air conditioning for the former is necessary to survival. ??Since baseline is based on averages a single apartment dweller and a family of four who live in the same region could have the same baseline. That makes it more likely for the family to get hit with rate hikes and less likely economists fear that the apartment dweller has a financial incentive to conserve. ??Where it is imperfect is that it has no ability to make any adjustments for the size of the family said John Nelson a PG&E spokesman. ??Focusing baseline on household size gets complicated Florio said. Does PG&E come by and do bed checks? ??Along with raising $5.7 billion to replenish the state's general fund for power buys since January the rate hikes approved March 27 by the PUC and allocated on Tuesday were also meant to trigger conservation that could help avoid rolling blackouts this summer. ??Baseline has not been reassessed since the early 1990s. PUC president Loretta Lynch and fellow commissioner Wood say they may hold hearings as early as this coming week on possible inequities and ways to update the system. ??There was plenty of testimony at public hearings that people suspect that baselines are not appropriate or are not calculated right Wood said. ??Wood said when baseline first was created nearly 20 years ago houses were smaller and many lacked central air conditioning. ??Though the PUC has updated baseline amounts through the years living standards have changed housing standards have changed and it may be that average usage is different from what it was Wood said. ??Florio said giving baselines a second look could go either way for consumers. There are typically more electronic gadgets in homes these days but many of those gadgets and appliances are more energy efficient than their ancestors. ??Add that to increased conservation statewide Florio said and there's a slim chance baselines could actually go down and expose more customers to rate hikes. ??It's a percentage of average use historically and people have used energy more efficiently through the years Florio said. ??--- ??On the Net: ??California Public Utilities Commission: http://www.cpuc.ca.gov ??Pacific Gas and Electric Co.: http://www.pge.com ??Southern California Edison Co.: http://www.sce.com LOAD-DATE: May 22 2001 of 85 DOCUMENTS ???????????????????The Associated Press State & Local Wire The materials in the AP file were compiled by The Associated Press. ?These materials may not be republished without the express written consent of The Associated Press. ????????????????????????May 21 2001 Monday BC cycle SECTION: State and Regional LENGTH: 273 words HEADLINE: New poll suggests Californians haven't been this gloomy for years DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO BODY: ??Not since the mid-'90s have more Californians believed the state is headed in the wrong direction. ??And it may get worse. ?Nearly 60 percent of state residents expect the economy to worsen in the next year while about 40 percent see a brighter horizon according to a new poll. ??The telephone survey of 2001 adult Californians was done over eight days in early May by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California.

Headlines proclaimed a crisis and legislative leaders shifted into an I told you so mode. ??Hold the phone. ??This is not California. There is no crisis. Customers with interruptible service contracts have always been subject to cutoffs in times of peak consumption or when generators are down. ??It may not be fair to suggest that Alliant Energy chose to idle three of its biggest generators to make the case for changing the law but the timing is nonetheless convenient. The Legislature is set to convene a special session in a few weeks and among the business left over from the regular session could be a bill to make it easier for power companies to build electric generating plants. ??While crisis is not imminent Iowa does face the prospect of consuming more electricity than the state's utilities are able to generate themselves. ... ??While Iowa's law may need some streamlining which could be dealt with in a special session that should not be the end of the matter. Ultimately the Legislature must fashion a long-range energy policy for this state that takes a regional view of energy that reflects new market and regulation realities and that seizes the potential for conservation and renewable alternatives to fossil fuels. ??Legislative session: ??TELEGRAPH HERALD ??Even after a marathon legislative session - this one lasted 121 days - why does it always seem the big-ticket items are pushed through in the final days? ??This year's session started out strong passing a bill to save taxpayers money by eliminating the sales tax on residential utility bills. It finished up by coming through with $40 million for teachers' pay. ??But just what happened in those middle 100 or so days is a little murky. There was plenty of hand-wringing about the budget shortfall the usual banter about dove hunting and a fair amount of partisan bickering. ... ??-Legislators didn't get around to a ... bill to close a loophole in Iowa's Open Records law. The way it stands now a governmental body can use a private contractor to investigate problems within the department and keep that contractor's report confidential under the law's whistle-blower provision. ... ??-The Legislature didn't want to get into a full-blown gambling debate so it didn't address a tax freeze at racetracks. ... The issue of fairness needs to be addressed. ??Floating casinos pay a 20 percent tax while racetracks pay a gradually increasing tax that now stands at 30 percent. Under the law enacted in 1997 that tax will grow to 36 percent by 2004. ??-Other things that legislators talked about but didn't get around to include: cutting state income tax on Social Security income and a pair of bills addressing the state's bottle-deposit law. ??So the 2002 Legislature will have its work cut out for it. Here are some jobs for next year's to-do list: ??-Amend the Open Records Law. Allowing agencies to keep information about government activities secret simply because it is in the possession of an outside contractor is a hole in the law that needs to be fixed. ??-Carry the ball on increasing teachers' pay. The $40 million shot in the arm will have been a waste if the program is left hanging unfunded. ??-Freeze the amount of tax racetracks pay where it stands and stop the hemorrhaging of dollars into state coffers. The disparity between racetracks and riverboat casinos needs to be righted. ??And if they're worried that the discussion will draw an all-out gambling debate lawmakers might want to bring it to the table before May. ??IOWA CITY PRESS-CITIZEN: ??We agree with Gov. Tom Vilsack that the new state budget approved by legislators will cause hardship for people and families across our state. ??That's what happens when you face a $300 million revenue shortfall and you don't have as much money as you wanted. ??But we disagree that for 3 1/2 months they did very little. ??On the contrary Vilsack got what he said all along would be the high mark of this session - $40 million for teacher pay raises and a new system for teacher pay. ??And the Republican-led Legislature also agreed to phase out the sales tax on utilities long a goal of Vilsack's Democratic Party. ??Are we happy with the budget? No. ??Is it the best we likely can do under the circumstances? Yes. ??Vilsack should sign budget legislation rather than vetoing it and calling a special session of the Legislature this summer. ... ??Plant Sciences Institute: ??DES MOINES REGISTER: ??Iowa needs more people especially young people. Iowa needs more jobs that pay well - the kinds of jobs that cause other businesses small and large to spring up here. So why did Iowa lawmakers blow the single best opportunity for both? ??They blame it on a tight budget. Blame them for failing to grasp the big picture. The fledgling Plant Sciences Institute at Iowa State University could become a major force in the fast-growing field of biotechnology related to agriculture - yet the 2001 Legislature provided no new money. ??It did continue the $4.67 million approved in 2000. It did not add $3 million a meager increase proposed by the governor. It allowed ISU to keep money from the sale of land with proceeds to be used for the institute's Roy J. Carver Co-Laboratory to be completed by 2002. It should have added at least $10 million in cash. ... ??Because of legislative inaction promising initiatives must slow down or may never take place. ... ??The institute had hoped to hire another top researcher in the field of corn genomics ... ??Ag-biotech companies have been appealing to the state for help putting together a protein-extraction facility ... Such a facility might extract protein from conventional or genetically modified plants for such uses as pharmaceuticals food additives or chemical enzymes for industrial processes. The Plant Sciences Institute has a small pilot protein-extraction facility. New money from the Legislature would have allowed it to assist businesses in establishing a commercial facility. But now? The people interested in this will probably go elsewhere said Director Stephen Howell. ??Why wouldn't they? Plenty of other states are serious about fostering biotech industries. The Iowa commitment is hardly encouraging. ... ??Iowa has a budget crunch because its economy and population are not growing fast enough. Investing in biotechnology - the technology that is expected to drive the next great wave of economic growth - is the most promising way to make Iowa's economy and population grow. Stinting on that investment is stunningly shortsighted. ??Ten million dollars next session should not be out of the question. The question should be what sort of future will Iowa have if it does not make the most of the potential the Plant Sciences Institute holds. ??Hunting requirements: ??AMES TRIBUNE: ??In April the Iowa House and Senate rejected a measure that would have required wild turkey hunters to report their harvest to the Department of Natural Resources saying it was just another hassle for hunters. ??Then the House hiked the fees for hunting licenses in some cases up to 218 percent. A non-resident who wants to hunt deer in Iowa under this plan will have to shell out $308 including a hunting license and habitat fee. The current total is $156. ??Hassle? You got it. We might as well hang a sign on Iowa borders that says we don't much care about managing our wildlife and we don't want you here either. Add to the mix a federal whammy in the Freedom to Farm Act which has all but eliminated any fence rows and hunting as a potential tourism draw to Iowa blows away in the wind. ... ??Instead of having accurate information on how much hunting is affecting turkey populations Department of Natural Resources wildlife managers are now left to guess. ... ??Surrounding states which capitalize on their resources require even more harvest registration and it hasn't slowed interest. ... ??The DNR asked for the fee increases for good reasons - license fees have not increased for a decade while the costs of salaries travel and equipment have begun to eat into funds available for facilities and land acquisition. And we're in favor of using fees to support wildlife management. ??We also would allow that some of the increases do not seem to us to be egregious. A $3 fish habitat fee for instance isn't a great deal to pay. Nor is a $30 tab for a non-resident 7-day fishing license out of line. ??But some fee hikes were too much. ??In particular the non-resident fees for deer hunting are high especially in comparison to surrounding states and are more than most ordinary people are likely to pay. Wisconsin charges non-residents $135 to hunt deer. Missouri charges $125. License fees in Iowa are likely to result in less money coming in not more. What out-of-state hunter will be drawn to Iowa when surrounding states are managing their herds better and charging less to visit? ??Iowa worries that the farm economy is in the tank. We wring our hands as our young people rush to other parts of the country. We say that our natural resources here can be an attraction that will draw people back. Yet these votes run counter to sound wildlife management and increased tourism. ??Public official recruits: ??QUAD-CITY TIMES: ??More Iowa school districts and local governments are using professional companies to help find high-level administrators such as superintendents but that recruiting tool is making the process less accountable to the public. ??In effect it allows private firms to dictate public policy and that's troubling. ??One example of this trend is the Camanche School District where six finalists for the superintendents job were in town for interviews recently. They met with school board members district staff and some residents yet the board does not intend to reveal the names of the candidates. The Cedar Rapids headhunter firm that has contracted with the district advised the school board not to announce the names. ??Headhunters also are advising candidates to request their names be kept confidential. Under Iowa law a public entity such as a school board must honor such a request. ??Some public officials justify this secrecy by arguing that finalists don't want the public to know if they didn't get the job offer or worry that identification may jeopardize their current position. ... ??Those arguments aren't justified for reasons including: ??-There is nothing dishonorable in not being chosen for a top-level post. Indeed being considered a finalist for such a job may serve only to enhance a candidates attractiveness for another position ... ??-Identifying the finalists for the public also allows citizens to ask questions and provide other information critical or supportive that could be useful in helping officials make a final choice. ??-And being upfront with the public lends credibility to the entire process ... ??We prefer a process similar to one used by the City of Clinton during its recent search for a city administrator. The five finalists were not only identified they took part in an open house to meet the public. A headhunter firm was used but City Attorney Bruce Johansen himself a candidate who did not get the job said he made it clear to the agency that the finalists names should be made public. ??We applaud that effort ... ??Meanwhile the Iowa Legislature this spring modified a state law that has been the basis of confidentiality claims for candidates seeking public positions. The change would require that official communication between private contractors and the public entities they serve be open to public inspection. Whether that law will be interpreted to include headhunter firms remains to be seen. ... ??We encourage school boards and local governments to resist confidentiality and test the new law when it takes effect July 1. ??Train service: ??CEDAR RAPIDS GAZETTE: ??Who'd have thought that the selection of the secretary of the federal Department of Human Services last winter might affect whether Davenport Iowa City and Des Moines get rail service. ??But consider that HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson who resigned recently from the Amtrak board had been a strong advocate of expanded rail service here in the Midwest while he was governor of Wisconsin. Thompson had hoped to remain chairman of the Amtrak board after he went to Washington. But the Associated Press reports that a 1997 law that restructured the Amtrak board says only one of the seven seats can be held by a member of the Cabinet - and the Bush administration wants Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta on the governing board. ??Few people around are as passionate as Thompson about Amtrak and Iowa could have benefited. It's hard to ride a national passenger train service that doesn't go where the majority of Iowans live. Maybe the service will be expanded here. But maybe with the changes in the governing board that train has already left the station. ??Smoker identification: ??LE MARS DAILY SENTINAL: ??Have you heard the news from Walgreen's? They're going to card everybody who wants to buy a package of cigarettes a box of cigars a can of chew. ??Everybody. Not under 18. Not 27 and under. Everybody. ... ??That can't have been an easy decision. Within a year they're looking at software that will require clerk's to enter a customer's birth date into a computer before a tobacco sale can be completed. Until then they're asking their clerks to card everybody. Good for them. ... ??Yes it will take a little extra time ... Evidently the owners/corporate bigwigs think the time is well spent if it eliminates the fines and bad publicity. ??A convenience store association spokesman told reporters that other stores are likely to duplicate Walgreen's efforts. Yes. We certainly hope so. ??We all have heard terrible numbers of deaths caused by tobacco of underage users ... Many if not most of us know someone who hacks and coughs who died from smoking who cries because someone died from smoking. When you think of them it doesn't seem so outrageous to card everyone. It seems downright brilliant. ... ??It won't stop it entirely. Young wanna-be-smokers will have somebody older do the buying or swipe a carton. There will always be a way to get around it there always is. ??Still carding everyone says This is important we mean it and we're not going to make it easy for you.

Jones - Business Video ?????????????????????SHOW: CNBC/DOW JONES BUSINESS VIDEO 21 2001 Monday # 052100cb.y50 TYPE: INTERVIEW SECTION: Business LENGTH: 807 words HEADLINE: PG&E Chairman & CEO - Interview GUESTS: Robert Glynn BYLINE: Mark Haines Joe Battipaglia BODY: ?THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. MARK HAINES CNBC ANCHOR SQUAWK BOX: One company that is hurting a lot in all this is PG&E the parent of Pacific Gas and Electric. They filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April. PG&E has about $9 billion in unrecovered power costs. A California bankruptcy judge says the company cannot raise retail rates to recoup those losses. The stock is on a steep decline this year trading in the 52 week range of 6 to 32 last at about 11 1/2. Joining us to tell us where things are now and where they could be going Robert Glynn PG&E's Chairman and CEO. Mr. Glynn good to see you again. ROBERT GLYNN CHAIRMAN & CEO PG&E: Good morning Mark. HAINES: So where do we stand now? GLYNN: Well we're working our way through the federal bankruptcy proceeding where we affirmatively stepped in order to resolve issues between ourselves and our creditors. We have a plan of reorganization under development and we're getting close to the time when we can begin to share that plan with the creditors who after all need to get paid. HAINES: So let's first talk about time. How much time do you think this might take before PG&E emerges from bankruptcy? GLYNN: Well it's very hard to tell for one reason. There have not been very many utility bankruptcies and I don't know of any that has had these complexities to it. The shortest possible time or shortest likely time that I've heard about has been six to eight months and that's probably shorter than it will take. The longest that I've heard about is about four years and that's an awful lot longer than I want it to take. HAINES: In the meantime you are selling electricity transmitting and selling electricity on a retail level. Are you still losing money on your operating? GLYNN: Well the potential area for continuing loss exposure is the issue of whether the California independent system operator is still buying on behalf of our company instead of buying directly on behalf of our customers. And that's an issue that's before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for decision making right now. HAINES: Well I guess my question is who is paying the bills right now? GLYNN: Well the electric rates in California have just been raised by the California Public Utilities Commission in order to have the state the Department of Water Resources be able to recover all of its costs because that's what of course it wants to do. It doesn't want to go any deeper in debt than it has to. So this most recent large rate increase has applied as best as we can tell exclusively to cover the state's cost increases and not to cover some of the ones that we're responsible for. JOE BATTIPAGLIA: Mr. Glynn the brownouts continue in California. What's the status of supply of electricity into the state putting aside for a moment how you pay for it? GLYNN: Well the California electricity crisis at its heart is a supply shortage and the outlook for this summer and next summer are pretty bleak. Every responsible entity that has reviewed the situation is forecasting that there will be a large number of rolling blackouts occurring over the summer of 2001 and probably 2002 as well simply because there's not enough power to go around. BATTIPAGLIA: Does that spread from California to other states as the draw down becomes perilous? GLYNN: Well the California electricity market and the Pacific Northwest markets have had a very nice symbiotic relationship over many many years shipping power back and forth to one another. That has been interrupted because of the supply shortage in California which means that California is trying to be a net importer all the time. And it seems like the Pacific Northwest won't have the kind of surplus energy to send south to California that it's had in the past. HAINES: Does this ultimately end with retail electricity distribution transmission and distribution being done by a state authority and no longer by privately held or publicly held companies? GLYNN: I don't think it ends there at all Mark. And I certainly don't think that it's in the state's interest to try to get into businesses that can be done by private capital when the state has so many other important things to use its capital on like education and infrastructure. And I do think that this supply shortage has got to be resolved. It's got to be resolved by building new supply. There's simply no alternative to that and that's going to take another couple of years before that new construction is fully completed. HAINES: All right sir. Thank you very much for the update. We appreciate it. Robber Glynn PG&E's Chairman and CEO.

BUSH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Everything I know about the spoken word I learned right here at Yale. ??(LAUGHTER) ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??ANNOUNCER: Now Judy Woodruff takes you INSIDE POLITICS. ??JUDY WOODRUFF CNN ANCHOR: Thank you for joining us. ?We begin with the Bush administration responding to pressure to get more involved in promoting Middle East peace. ??As an escalating cycle of violence between Israelis and Palestinians continued today Secretary of State Colin Powell appointed a diplomat to help the two sides end the fighting and resume talks. ?And he urged the parties to use the report of a commission appointed by former President Clinton as a springboard to peace. ??Let's get more now from CNN national security correspondent David Ensor -- David. DAVID ENSOR CNN CORRESPONDENT: Judy Ambassador William Burns the U.S. ambassador to Jordan who is Mr. Powell's pick to be the next assistant secretary for the Middle East has been asked to work with other recommendations for Mr. Powell and for President Bush on how the U.S. can best proceed from here trying to use the recommendations of the Mitchell committee report to try to get the violence to de- escalate to try to get the two sides talking instead of shooting at each other. ??Here is how Mr. Powell put it today. ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??POWELL: It is now up to the leaders in the region to show that they have heard this clarion call from this committee in a loud-and- clear way and take actions that are available to them on both sides to let's have a cessation of hostilities then we can begin the confidence-building measures and move toward negotiations. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??ENSOR: Now this report makes very specific recommendations and urges very specific actions by both sides: in both cases quite difficult actions. ?First it calls for the Palestinians and the Israelis to declare an immediate unconditional cessation of violence. That's the first step and that's the step that Secretary Powell repeatedly emphasized today must come first and must come right away or else nothing else will work. ??But the report goes on to make specific recommendations. ?For example it urges that Israel put -- freeze all settlement development all development of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories. ?It recommends that Israel resume paying the money that's collected in taxes back to the Palestinian Authority. ?It recommends a whole range of action many of them to be taken by Israel which the reports says would help bring the tone back to where it needs to be would help bring the two sides back to where they could once again be negotiating instead of shooting at each other and letting off bombs. ??The -- the secretary Secretary Powell said that this is not the time however for him to get involved in shuttle diplomacy. ?He wants first to have Ambassador Burns and the others come up with recommendations over the next week two weeks or three and then he and the president will try to figure out where the U.S. can go from here. ??But clearly this is -- clearly this is a first step by an administration that until now has tried to keep its -- keep its powder a bit dry in the Middle East. ?They are now engaging somewhat because they're so concerned about the situation out there Judy. ??WOODRUFF: David the report the Mitchell report suggesting that the Israelis more responsible here or at least that they have more to do in order to get things back on the peace track than the Palestinians? ENSOR: The report is very even-handed. ?It doesn't blame either side for the situation. ?It for example does not blame Ariel Sharon's visit to the Temple Mount for the following Intifada Intifada II it's been called. ?But it says that there needs to be a series of actions by both sides to bring down the tensions and if you look at the list of what it's asking for there are more steps that the Israelis would have to take than the Palestinians. ??WOODRUFF: And David why is it that the administration is saying at this point that it is not prepared to get back in -- in a -- in a day-to-day way in an energetically involved way the way the Clinton administration was? ??ENSOR: Well I think the administration this administration feels that the Clinton people got -- got to the point where they were micromanaging the thing a little bit. ?It was too much presidential involvement and it was too much of a day-to-day hand-holding operation. ?They feel they need to hold back a little bit and try to get the parties to talk to each other. ??However the situation is deteriorating pretty rapidly and so now they realize they have to have some greater involvement. ?And that's why Ambassador Burns has been asked to prepare these recommendation Judy. ??WOODRUFF: All right. ?David Ensor reporting for us from the State Department. ??For more on the Middle East conflict stay with us for a special half-hour report. ?That's beginning at 6:00 p.m. Eastern. ??Now we turn to questions about the Bush administration's political fund-raising tactics. ?Tonight Vice President Dick Cheney is scheduled to host some 400 big GOP donors at his official residence in Washington. ?A spokeswoman for the Democrats says that that event smacks of in her words hypocrisy. ??The Democrats say the reception at the vice president's home is comparable to Clinton-era events such as White House coffees and Lincoln Bedroom sleepovers for big donors which drew heavy criticism from Republicans. ?Among them: presidential candidate George W. Bush. ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??BUSH: I believe they've moved that sign The buck stops here from the Oval Office desk to the buck stops here on the Lincoln Bedroom. ?And that's not good for the country it's not right. ?We need to have a new look about how we conduct ourselves in office. There's a huge trust. ?I see it all the time when people come up to me and say I don't want you to let me down again. ??And we can do better than the past administration has done. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??WOODRUFF: Despite that sort of criticism then the Republicans are defending their fund-raising tactics now. ?Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott had this to say about the reception for big donors at Vice President Cheney's home tonight. ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??SEN. TRENT LOTT (R-MS) MAJORITY LEADER: I'm sure it's being done in an inappropriate way or Dick Cheney wouldn't -- wouldn't be doing it. ?So if there's any question I'd suggest you address it to them. ?Unfortunately I think that most of us will not be able to be there. ?We're going to be here voting giving tax relief. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??WOODRUFF: Virtually all of those GOP contributors who will mingle with Vice President Cheney at his home tonight have given at least $100000 to the Republican National Committee. ?They will also attend a major RNC fund-raiser tomorrow night that features President Bush as the main speaker and is expected to net some $15 million in soft money. ??Now let's bring in our White House correspondent Major Garrett. ??Major tell us about what this event is about tomorrow night. ??MAJOR GARRETT CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well it's the first official Republican National Committee event to honor the president and the first lady as you said. The targeted haul is $15 million. Republican National Committee officials tell CNN that it's about 70 percent of that 15 million will be soft money. ?About 30 percent will be hard dollars -- that is dollars that are regulated under the existing campaign finance scheme -- and that it is a big event one that the Republican Party has held for years and years in Washington. ??As for what's happening in the vice president's residence tonight White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer told me this is a way of saying Thank you in his words to those Republicans who as Ari Fleischer said did so much to help win the selection. ??And he draws a distinction with the Clinton-era coffees and sleepovers describing them as quote organized schemes to bring people through the gates of the White House to get money or to persuade others to do so. ??Mark Minor who is the communications director for the Republican National Committee also said that no one paid to go to the vice president's residence. No checks will pass between hands there. There is no quid pro quo and that some people who will be at the vice president's residence tonight are not in fact RNC donors -- Judy. ??WOODRUFF: So Major again clarify the distinction between money events that are given as a thank you and events that are given as an encouragement to give more money. ??GARRETT: Well it's a distinction this White House wants to draw as clearly as it possibly can. ?In the words of Ari Fleischer thanking someone whether it's on government property or not on government property is a completely legitimate activity for the president or the vice president to engage in. ?The distinction he is drawing is that during the Clinton era people were brought to the White House to these coffees and as was disclosed in the Thompson report that was conducted by the Senate investigating that there was some evidence of actually targeted lists: that people who were brought in money was described to bringing in for a coffee. ?A certain dollar amount was attached to donations to the Democratic National Committee a larger amount if they in fact slept here at the White House in the Lincoln Bedroom. ?That is the key distinction the Republicans say: that there is no targeting necessarily of these people to come to the vice president's residence. ??They also point out that the original letters inviting these big donors to Washington did not in any way suggest there would be a reception at the vice president's residence: the point there being these people donated without any expectation of having dinner or reception with Lynne Cheney and Dick Cheney in the vice president's home. ??WOODRUFF: And Major just to clarify the 400 people invited tonight to the vice president's how many are they saying did not give money? ??GARRETT: They're not disclosing any numbers. ?They're only saying that some have given. ?They clearly and readily acknowledge that. ?Some are lobbyists. Some represent large corporations. ?But others they say are just Republican National Committee officials. And others of an undisclosed nature -- not fund-raisers not Republican Party officials -- who will be there tonight. Don't have any numbers for you on that though. ??WOODRUFF: All right Major Garrett reporting at the White House. Thank you very much. ??Vice President Cheney maybe taking some heat for fund-raising tactics not to mention his role in creating the Bush energy plan. Look that this: ??Our new poll shows Cheney's job approval rating is 4 points higher than the presidents. ?While Mr. Bush's approval rating has held pretty steady in the past couple of weeks he has lost ground since late April. ?Cheney's approval rating has dipped as well. ??For more on Mr. Bush's ratings and how they relate to his policies we are joined now by our senior political analyst Bill Schneider. ??Tell us Bill which of Mr. Bush's policies is the most popular? ??WILLIAM SCHNEIDER CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well you might guess energy given the high ratings for Dick Cheney that you just reported -- but you would be wrong. ??Because what Americans like best is the tax cut. ?Two thirds of the public now favors a substantial tax cut. ?That's up from 60 percent earlier this month. Well why not? ?What's wrong with getting some money back from the government? ??Actually most people do not think the tax cut could benefit them much financially. ?They like it because they believe it will help the economy. ?And that is why so many Democrats find it very difficult to oppose. ??WOODRUFF: What about the energy plan? ??SCHNEIDER: Not such a success. ?Not like the tax cut. ?Americans are actually divided over the president's energy plan. ?Why? ?It's not because the public blames the Bush administration for the nation's energy problems. ?Most people blame the oil companies. ??In fact more people blame Congress and the Clinton administration and environmental laws and American consumers than blame the Bush administration. But most Americans still give President Bush low marks on energy. ?The core criticism of his energy plan is: it doesn't do enough. ?55 percent of Americans say President Bush is not doing enough to solve the country's energy problems. ??What doesn't the plan do? ?It doesn't do much right now. ?Only 8 percent of Americans believe the plan will help the nation's energy problem immediately. Most people think oh it will help but only after several years. ?It's a long-run solution. ?Americans want help now. ?Right now. ?With electricity in California. ?And with gas prices all over the country. ?Long-term solutions are important but politics is a short-term business. ?If the problem is now people want results now. ??And they don't see what the Bush energy plan is going to do about $2-a-gallon gasoline now. ??WOODRUFF: Why do people think the energy plan fails to do that? ??SCHNEIDER: Because they think this administration is run by oilmen. ?Oilmen like $2-a-gallon gasoline. ?Maybe even 3. ??By nearly two to one the public believes energy companies have too much influence over the Bush administration's policies. ?In fact Americans are split when you ask them whether the Bush energy plan is designed to further the country's interests or the energy companies' interests. ?That sounds like breathtaking cynicism. ?But any administration that's run by Texas oilmen is automatically suspect. ??WOODRUFF: All right Bill Schneider thank you very much. You're not suspect. ??SCHNEIDER: I am certainly not. ??WOODRUFF: At least as far as we know. ??Do Californians blame President Bush for their energy crisis? We've heard a little bit from Bill on that. ?That answer and more on the issue later this hour. ?Plus: ??Just what kind of tax cut is the Senate considering? ?Jonathan Karl crunches the numbers. ?Also: ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have no ability to bring up the amendments. ?You don't set the agenda every day and that is real power in the House. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??WOODRUFF: The trials and tribulations of the minority leader as he considers the present and the future. ?And later: ??Rewarding a president's most controversial decision. ?A political Profile In Courage. All ahead on INSIDE POLITICS. ??(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ??WOODRUFF: President Bush today donned the traditional commencement robes and gave the graduating class at Yale University a few bits of advice. ?The president also included a glimpse at his less-than-perfect college years. ?As CNN's Kelly Wallace reports today's speech was a departure from how the President's dealt with his alma mater in the past. ??(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ??KELLY WALLACE CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A homecoming of sorts George W. Bush who has only been back to his alma mater once since graduating in 1968 returns to address those at the top and the bottom of Yale's graduating class. ??BUSH: And to the C students... ??(LAUGHTER) ??I say you too can be president of the United States. ??(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) ??WALLACE: The president offering a self-deprecating account of his days as the undergraduate when as a history major he earned modest grades and was known more as a fraternity boy prankster than a rising political star. ??The visit was not without controversy with some students protesting and some professors boycotting charging that Mr. Bush was not yet deserving of an honorary degree. ??PETER BROOKS YALE UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR: It doesn't seem at present to represent the intellectual ideals and the service to humanity in which we think that Yale stands for. ??WALLACE: The president has kept his distance from this Ivy League institution for most of his political life painting it as a symbol of elitism even during his days at Yale. TERRY JOHNSON BUSH'S YALE ROOMMATE: What George -- does not respond well to are people who are snobs whether you are a social snob or an intellectual snob or any other kind of snob. ??WALLACE: Mr. Bush rarely mentions what he did on this day that he was born in New Haven when his dad the former president was an undergraduate at Yale. ??BUSH: My life began just a few blocks from here but I was raised in West Texas. ?From there Yale always seemed a world away. ??WALLACE: The president for years had been miffed with Yale for not awarding an honorary degree to his dad until 1991 the third year of his presidency. ?But it appears now all is forgiven. ??BUSH: In my time they spoke of the Yale man I was really never sure of what that was. ?But I do think that I am a better man because of Yale. ??WALLACE: Mr. Bush the son and grandson of Yalies and now father of a current student seems very proud that Yale is a part of his past. ??Kelly Wallace CNN New Haven Connecticut. ??(END VIDEOTAPE) ??WOODRUFF: And looking now ahead to 2004: the Reverend Al Sharpton says that he will explore seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. ?The civil rights activist said yesterday that the party did not protect the rights of disenfranchised voters in Florida in the last presidential race. ??If he runs Sharpton said that he would promote issues that concern blacks and progressives and his effort would not be just symbolic. ?Sharpton ran unsuccessfully for the Senate in New York in 1994 and for mayor of New York City in 1997. ??Reverend Sharpton and former Republican presidential candidate Gary Bauer will discuss President Bush's faith-based plan to help the poor tonight on CROSSFIRE. That's at 7:30 p.m. Eastern. ??Another note from New York: a state supreme court justice today barred Rudy Giuliani's girlfriend from the mayor's official residence Gracie Mansion. ?The judge ruled in favor of Giuliani's estranged wife Donna Hanover who had requested a restraining order barring Judith Nathan from the residence. ?The ruling says that Nathan may not enter the residence as long as the Giuliani children continue to live there. ?The judge also denied Giuliani's second attempt for a gag order in the couple's divorce proceedings. ??And we'll have the latest on President Bush's tax cut when we come back. ??(COMMERCIAL BREAK) WOODRUFF: This evening the Senate is expected to vote on the latest version of the now $1.35 trillion tax cut plan. ?Republican leaders hope to give President Bush the tax cut for approval before Memorial Day. ?But as Jonathan Karl reports taxpayers will have a longer wait before reaping any of the measure's benefits. ??(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ??JONATHAN KARL CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Senate's $1.35 trillion tax cut would be the biggest in a generation but don't spend your tax windfall yet. ?Most of the cuts will not take effect for several years to come. ??Relief from the so-called major penalty will not start until the year 2005. The estate tax won't be repealed until 2011. ?That means even if President Bush is re-elected it wouldn't take effect until two years after he completed his second term. ?The IRA contribution limit would be raised from $2000 to $5000 but that also wouldn't happen until the year 2011. ??The tax cut calls for doubling of the child tax credit but that takes 10 years too. ?The credit would rise from $500 to $600 this year slowly increasing in $100 increments over the next 10 years until it finally reaches $1000 in the year 2011. ?The cuts in income tax rates would be phased in even more slowly. ??SEN. CHARLES GRASSLEY (R-IA) FINANCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: You are right some of them do not -- are phased in over a period of time. But there is real relief in this tax bill for every taxpayer starting January 1 2001. ?They don't have to wait until next year. ??KARL: That immediate tax relief amounts to $300 for individuals and $600 for couples filing jointly but just how that money gets back to taxpayers is still to be worked out. ?The option favored by the president is a simple rebate check sent directly to taxpayers an idea opposed by many Senate Republicans who call it impractical. ??But the rebate would represent a fraction of the overall tax cut which Democratic opponents say will explode in cost after it's fully phased in two years from now. ??SEN. KENT CONRAD (D) NORTH DAKOTA: This plan is fully back- loaded. ?That means simply that it is disguised in terms of its full cost. ?This decade it cost $1.35 trillion. ?In the next decade it will cost from 3.5 to $4 trillion. ??KARL: But there's a little noticed provision of this tax cut that may make that point moot. ?The tax cut includes a sunset provision that means all the tax cuts in the bill would expire in the year 2012. ?For the tax cuts to remain in place Congress would have to pass them again. ??(END VIDEOTAPE) ??KARL: Now the Senate is expected to vote on a series of amendments to the tax cut later on today paving the way for a final vote on the tax cut here in the Senate tonight. ?But it will not end there. ?This still needs to be reconciled with the tax cut that was passed in House the House passing almost exactly the president's tax cut including much deeper cuts in income tax rates preferred by Republicans. ??The Senate and the House will have to work out their differences. They're expected to do so this week setting the stage to send this final tax cut down Pennsylvania Avenue and onto the president's desk by Memorial Day -- Judy. ??WOODRUFF: Jon when you talk about the plan providing 300 or $300 a year per individual divided by 12 that's $20-some a month. Is this the kind of money the president was talking about when he said the tax cut would help people with higher gasoline prices? ??KARL: This was exactly what he had it mind. ?This was exactly what he was talking about directing the money right into the hands of taxpayers directly into the hands of those people paying higher gasoline prices at the pumps. ??This is an idea that his Treasury secretary Paul O'Neill strongly favors the idea of direct cash payments or check payments to taxpayers. ?But one big problem with this Judy is that taxpayers over the course of time move they change addresses some of them die. The question is how do you make sure you get all the right checks to those people at current addresses? ?It's not an easy proposition. ??WOODRUFF: And Jon one other subject we know the president's nominee to be solicitor general of the United States has run into a real problem in the Senate committee. ?Where does that stand right now? ?The last we heard the Senate Judiciary had split 9-9 on the nomination of Ted Olson. ??KARL: Well the Senate leaders Trent Lott and Tom Daschle are now actively involved in this trying to come to some kind of an agreement an agreement that will allow the Democrats to get access to some information they want about Olson especially information that was compiled by independent council Robert Ray looking to just what Olson's involvement was in that Arkansas Project by the American Spectator magazine the investigation into Bill Clinton's personal life. ??They want information from the independent council to look at just how involved Olson was in that project to see whether or not he was truthful in his testimony when he said he was not very involved at all. ?There's some movement to try to get the Democrats on the committee more of the information also maybe to release more of it to the public. ??If that's all done it would set the stage for a vote on the Olson nomination before the full Senate but probably not until after Memorial Day. ?The Senate goes on recess at the end of the week they will be off all of next week you probably won't see a vote on the Olson nomination until after they return. ??WOODRUFF: All right Jon Karl at the Capitol thanks. In the House of Representatives Democrats are finding themselves drowned out by the Republican majority. ?Add to that critics who say the party is lacking leadership and strategy. ?And life in the House minority begins to look bleak. ?Our Kate Snow caught up with the House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt to talk about the balance of power and his political future. ??(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ??REP. DICK GEPHARDT (D-MO) HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: We need to say what are we for and that's what... ??KATE SNOW CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Dick Gephardt will tell you it's frustrating being a Democrat these days stuck in the minority without the backing of the White House. ??GEPHARDT: Well you take what you -- what you are given. ?I mean the people run this country. ?We don't. ?And so you fight for what you believe in as hard as you can and if you really believe in it then you're frustrated if you're not able to those policies through. ??SNOW: Gephardt says the Democrats are forced to play defense responding to Republicans. ??GEPHARDT: I think we slowed down a little bit the amount of the tax bill -- not enough in my view -- but we lowered it some so that the potential deficits out there in the future won't be so large. ?I think we cooperated with the president on the educational bill at least the substance of it but we still haven't been able to convince him or the Republicans to put enough money into education to really make the program happen. ??On energy I think that we've got a very very positive alternative that I hope people will listen to. ?People in California and Oregon and Washington need help now. ??SNOW: That was last week's theme. ?First at a gas station the lawn of the Capitol the next day and then in a underground war room. ??Gephardt is a master at staying on message often spending hours talking to the press his strategy: agree with Republicans when he thinks they're right and hammer at home when he disagrees. ??GEPHARDT: If we do not learn from history we are forced to repeat it. ?This is a mistake that we will pay for for years to come. ??I try not to yell. ?I try to get ideas across as good a way as I can. ?But there are times when you need to show your emotion. ?You need to let people know that you really care about this. ?And you really want the country to go in a different direction. ?And I think you can't appear too tentative or too laid back or too uninterested. ??SNOW: But is the strategy working? ??I have talked to some Democrats who say that they are truly unhappy. Some of whom say that they are unhappy with your leadership. ?They don't feel that you're doing an effective job. ?Do you feel that there is trouble within the ranks? ??GEPHARDT: I don't. ?I think that -- I think the ranks and the Democratic Party are largely unified. ?They are marching together and working together in ways that I've never seen them before. ?I always tell them that it's me and we. And we have to be a team. ??I would never tell you that anybody is ever going to be pleased every day with everything that happens but largely I think that we've achieved real unity and real effectiveness in being the loyal opposition here in Washington. ??SNOW: How much of your days are spent thinking about 2002 in the next election? ??GEPHARDT: Well I want to win the majority back. ?I think it's really important not for the party and not for me but for the country. ??SNOW: Is it more important to win back the majority than it is to win legislatively for the next couple of years? ??GEPHARDT: I think it is in the House for sure because the minority is really out of power totally in the House. ?You have no ability to bring up amendments you don't set the agenda every day. And that is real power in the House. ??SNOW: There is a lot of focus on 2004 a lot of talk about your ambitions do you have plans to run for president? ??GEPHARDT: I really think that if you don't stay totally focused on the goal that is ahead of you then you lessen your chances of reaching that goal. ?And my goal is to win back the majority in the Congress in 2002. ?I think as usual in our system we all want to look ahead and start calling the next race after that for president but that is not what I'm doing and not what I should be doing. ??SNOW (voice-over): Gephardt insists he's not planning ahead though he's scheduled to attend four events in New Hampshire in two weeks. ??GEPHARDT: The future will take of itself. ?I have no idea what will happen and I'm not worried about it and I don't spend time worrying about it. Because again I've got to do this in 2002. ?This is what we're trying to do. ??SNOW: So are you committed to staying minority leader through 2002? ??GEPHARDT: Absolutely. ?I'm totally committed to winning this House back and I think we are going to do it. ??SNOW: Speaker of the House you said to me last fall that that had a nice ring to it? GEPHARDT: It works for me. ??(END VIDEOTAPE) ??WOODRUFF: Kate Snow talking with House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt. ?They talked today. ?And later this week Kate will sit down with House Speaker Dennis Hastert. ?You can look for that report on Friday. ??On another term for the another high-profile Republican and two nationally known Democrats with apparent home state ambitions. ??INSIDE POLITICS will be right back. ??(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ??To no one's surprise Charlton Heston was reelected today to an unprecedented fourth term as president of the National Rifle Association. ?The 77-year-old actor was chosen at the NRA's annual convention in Kansas City. ?The group changed its rules last year to allow Heston a third term and a spokesman said there really wasn't much discussion by the board before deciding to elect him once again. ??Former Attorney General Janet Reno may be looking for a new line of work. Now back in her native Florida Reno says she finds the idea of running for governor appealing. ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??JANET RENO FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL: I love Florida very much. I was born and raised there. ?I have lived there most of my life. ?And I want to make sure that I do everything I can either as governor or otherwise to serve the interest of the people of Florida. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??WOODRUFF: Reno says she does not believe that her Parkinson's Disease would keep her from running and she expects to make a decision before the end of the year. ??Governor Jeb Bush says possible opponents do not factor into his decision on whether to run for reelection. ??House Minority Whip David Bonior may trade in his Congressional seat for a run at the governor's mansion. ?The 13-term Congressman from Michigan filed his paperwork today to become a candidate in Michigan's 2002 governor's race. ?His aides say that a formal announcement will come later. ?With Michigan slated to lose one House district Bonior's seat may be vulnerable to the state's Republican controlled redistricting efforts. ?Republican Governor John Engler cannot seek reelection because of term limits. ??Californians and the energy crunch: are they pointing fingers at the president? ?We'll check new poll numbers from the Golden State and discuss power politics in the state when we return. ??(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ??WOODRUFF: At ground zero on the energy crunch: more than half of Californians say they disapprove of the way President Bush is handling that state's power woes according to a new poll. ?But the survey shows more Californians are placing blame for the problem on utility companies former Governor Pete Wilson and current Governor Gray Davis than on President Bush and the federal government. ?The Democrats are trying hard to convince Californians that Republicans should be held accountable for the power problem. ?Here is a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ad that begins airing in Los Angeles today. ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??NARRATOR: California's energy crisis is deepening with summer blackouts predicted and rate hikes of up to 80 percent. Yet President Bush has offered no relief to hard-pressed rate payers. ?His spokesman saying The president continues to believe that the issue is mostly a California matter and our representative Stephen Horn has joined with Bush in opposing a temporary cap on electricity prices. ?Call Congressman Horn and tell him we need action now. ??That is if you can find the phone. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??WOODRUFF: The Democratic committee said that it has bought significant air time for that spot part of a month-long radio and TV ad campaign targeting Republicans on energy. ?Let's talk more now about energy politics with the director of that Public Policy Institute of California poll we just told you about Mark Baldassare joins us now from San Francisco. ??Mark first of all this poll finds Californians pessimistic in general did that surprise you? ??MARK BALDASSARE CALIFORNIA POLLSTER: It did. ?For the past three years we've been in an incredible time of optimism in California. ?Two-thirds of Californians have said that the state is going in the right direction. ?Most Californians felt that economic times would continue to be good and most Californians also were highly approving of the governor and the legislature. For the first time we've seen a dramatic drop in optimism about the state about the economy and ratings of the governor. ??WOODRUFF: And why do you think that is? ??BALDASSARE: Well eight in ten Californians say they have been closely following the electricity situation in the state and most Californians are telling us in our survey that they consider it the top issue and 80 percent of Californians say it's a big problem and moreover a problem that is going to effect the economy. ?So there's been a great deal of uncertainty that's been created by the electricity situation and because of that uncertainty people are beginning to feel very nervous about our state. ??WOODRUFF: So you're saying because of the electricity crisis if you want to call it that in California it's now driving people's views of everything: population the economy across-the-board. ??BALDASSARE: We -- for the past few years people have been focused on improving the schools for instance. ?Now only 6 percent in our most recent survey said that's the issue that concerns them most in the state. ?And we see that there is growing pessimism at the same time that there is growing concern that this electricity situation is not under control and could affect the state's economy. ??WOODRUFF: Explain for us Mark who people are blaming. ?We were -- Bill Schneider reported earlier on the program that Americans overall are having mixed views about to what extent President Bush is responsible. ?Here we're learning in California they hold President Bush far less responsible than they do local leaders. ??BALDASSARE: Yeah well we are at time right now in California where people haven't experienced the rate hikes yet. ?They've certainly heard about them. They haven't experienced for the most part frequent rolling blackouts but they hear that they're coming. And so when we talk about blame people are focused on what happened five years ago to put us into this situation. ?And for that of course they don't blame either the current governor or the current president. ?Now as we go forward over the next few months people are going to be re-assigning blame as well as re-evaluating the solutions that are in place and that's why I think both the Democrats and Republicans are very urgently trying to get their message out right now about who they think is to blame and who they think has the best solutions. ??WOODRUFF: Well Mark what is your reading on this? ?Are ads like the ones we just saw the Democrats running out there are those likely to have an effect on people's views? ??BALDASSARE: I don't think so. ?I think that what is will most going to have a effect on people's views over these next few months is how the crisis is actually resolved. ?And if people feel that these electricity hikes have really you know altered their lifestyle or they're going to impact the economy if they feel blackouts are really going to you know put them in an uncomfortable situation going through the summer then my guess is they are going to give blame both to Bush and to Davis. ??WOODRUFF: All right Mark Baldassare of the California Public Policy Institute. ?Thanks very much good to see you again. ??BALDASSARE: Thank you. ?Same here. ??WOODRUFF: As California tries to ease its energy problems there are concerns about the cost not only for consumers but for the environment. ?CNN's Rusty Dornin takes a closer look at the issues being raised by one California plant's effort to expand. ??(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ??RUSTY DORNIN CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): An aging giant known as the Mighty Moss. ?The 50-year-old Moss Landing Natural Gas plant along California's coast owned by Duke Energy. ?A face lift and an expansion will soon make this the largest power generator in the state providing 2.3 million homes with light heat and air conditioning. ?But all that power takes water to cool the turbines water that's home to otters fish herons and other wildlife. ??CAROLYN NIELSEN PLANT OPPONENT: Every day Duke will use 333 football-size fields -- pools of water that are 10 feet deep. ?That is just incomprehensible. ??DORNIN: Water from the wetlands run through the plant returning to the ocean 30 degrees warmer. ?Been that way for 50 years. ?Now environmentalists worry that increasing the intake will sterilize any creature sucked in. ??PATRICIA MATEJCEK SIERRA CLUB: Everything that lives in that volume of water: eggs from fish from clams diatoms young fish everything in it will be killed. ??DORNIN: Environmentalists say the Mighty Moss got a break on the approval process as regulators here faced the state's energy crisis. It took 14 months. Permitting for smaller plants in the state is down to 21 days. ??KAITILIN GAFFNEY CENTER FOR MARINE CONSERVATION: It's so fast that my concern is that we wouldn't even catch really obvious problems because we are just are not taking a hard look at these plants at all. ??DORNIN: But here's the twist as part of the permit process: local environmental groups signed off on the Mighty Moss renovation plan. ??GAFFNEY: So at the eleventh hour we were able to work out this deal with Duke to at least ensure that the scientific monitoring will go on. ??DORNIN (on camera): Duke Energy will spend more than $8 million expanding the wetlands and in donations to local environmental groups. There will also be an independent monitor who will assess any damage to the environment. ??TOM WILLIAMS DUKE ENERGY: This will more than compensate any potential effects that the new power plant will have on the habitat. This state is in an energy crisis. ?The new plant we're bringing on is cleaner more efficient than virtually any plant in the country today. ??DORNIN: Environmentalists made a deal here but many fear in a power-hungry state taking what they can get may be their only option. ??Rusty Dornin CNN Moss Landing California. ??(END VIDEOTAPE) ??WOODRUFF: A very different kind of power politics circa the 1970s is being seen in a whole new light in some circles. ?Former President Ford is honored for granting a famous -- some would say infamous -- at pardon. ??That's next on INSIDE POLITICS. ??(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ??WOODRUFF: It is something that many Americans that lived through the Watergate era might never dream they would see. ?An award named for a Democratic icon presented to the man who angered many Democrats by pardoning Richard Nixon. ??CNN's Bruce Morton has an inside view of this twist on political history. ??(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ??CAROLINE KENNEDY SCHLOSSBERG JOHN KENNEDY'S DAUGHTER: He placed his love of country ahead of his own political future. ?We are honored to present you President Ford with the John F. Kennedy Profile In Courage Award for 2001. ??(APPLAUSE) ??BRUCE MORTON CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Gerald Ford now 87 got the award because as a new unelected president he pardoned his predecessor Richard Nixon who had resigned in disgrace to avoid impeachment over the Watergate scandal. ??RICHARD M. NIXON 37TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow. ??MORTON: Our long national nightmare is over the new man said of Watergate. But really what would end it? ?Nixon could still face charges. ??GERALD FORD 38TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: My conscience tells me that only I as president have the constitutional power to firmly shut and seal this book. ??MORTON: And so he granted: ??FORD: A full free and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon. ??MORTON: Many Americans thought that was a mistake. ??SEN. TED KENNEDY (D) MASSACHUSETTS: I was one of those who spoke out against his actions then but time has a way of clarifying past events. ?And now we see that President Ford was right. ??MORTON: Not everyone agrees. ?Ford's press secretary at the time Gerald Ter Horst resigned to protest the Nixon pardon and still thinks it was wrong. ??JERRY TER HORST FORMER FORD PRESS SECRETARY: He was going to go off scot-free whereas all of his minions -- the people who worked at the White House from the chief of staff on down to Ehrlichman Chuck Colson and others -- they were going to have to do prison time they were not going to get pardons. MORTON: And it may have cost Ford the 1976 election. ?It was a close election. Many things could have swung it but the pardon was surely one. ?Jimmy Carter who beat Ford thanked him Inauguration Day. ??JAMES EARL CARTER 39TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: For myself and for our nation I want to thank my predecessor for all he has done to heal our land. ??MORTON: Accepting the award Ford talked about the need for courage today in a politics dominated by partisan jockeying at the expense of public policy. ??FORD: I sense a longing for community a desire on the part of Americans to be part of something bigger finer than themselves. ??MORTON: Historians may still argue about the pardon. ?They agree he cared about his country and its politics and did what he thought was right. ??Bruce Morton CNN Washington. ??(END VIDEOTAPE) ??WOODRUFF: Also cited for political courage today Democratic Congressman John Lewis of Georgia who was beaten as he and others challenged segregation during the freedom rides through the South in 1961. ??Lewis was given a special Profile of Courage Award for Lifetime Achievement. ??Former president Ford Congressman Lewis and Caroline Kennedy will all be guests tonight on WOLF BLITZER REPORTS.

Subject:: ATTORNEY/CLIENT COMMUNICATION//////CONFIDENTIAL and Privileged
Body:: Article II of the NONCOMPETITION AGREEMENT entered in connection with the sale of HPL to AEP (which closed as of June 12001) provides: ENA [for 3 months post-close] will not solicit negotiate or enter into any contract agreement or arrangement for the purchase of natural gas on the HPL Pipeline from any Person which is a supplier or producer of natural gas connected to the HPL Facilities provided however nothing herein shall be construed or interpreted as prohibiting ENA from entering into any such contract agreement or arrangement which is less than one month in duration and involves or is related to an Enron Online transaction. This is not the most clearly drafted provision as it was the subject of much negotiation....and was significantly narrowed from the original scope proposed by AEP. Thus please consult with me prior to entering into any solicitation agreement or arrangement which might arguably be covered by our limited covenant not to compete on the supply side for 3 months. There are many aspects of the post-close transition which will require cooperation between Enron and AEP/HPL and thus it behoves us to carefully weigh the risks and rewards of stepping too close to or over the line. Furtheralthough a technical reading of the non-competition agreement only applies to ENA no ENA UPSTREAM deals which would violate this covenant if there were to be done as ENA should be done without clearance from Brian Redmond and me. Please communicate this restriction to those who report to you and have need to be aware of this limited restriction. Sincerely BNG Dan J Hyvl 06/07/2001 04:59 PM To: Barbara N Gray/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Jeffrey T Hodge/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: ONEOK Energy Marketing and Trading Company Barbara This appears to be supply deal for deliveries at Katy that would be subject to the 90 day non-compete.

Subject:: Re: House and Senate Energy Hearings Today on California/Western
 Electric Situation
Body:: I left Hartsoe a voicemail on this issue too. I'm not sure we can convince Massey and others not to cap the secondary market for example but they need to understand the facts before they run off attacking the pipelines: gas utilities in California opposed interstate capacity expansions into the state. gas utilities had just as much opportunity as anyone else to participate in open seasons for capacity. gas utilities fialed to fill storage. gas utilites have failed to build adequate take away capacity at the Cal border I suspect Socal gas is using its interstate capacity and its in state storage to line its own pockets. In short if FERC wants to get to the bottom of the problem they need to look in California not outside. Ray Alvarez 05/04/2001 09:02 AM To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: House and Senate Energy Hearings Today on California/Western Electric Situation Steve I've been thinking about the intense preoccupation with gas prices lately and decided to pass this info along because I think it's a red flag. My concern is that there might not only be a backlash affecting our interstate pipelines but that our gas marketing efforts might be adversely affected. It might well be found that the holders of the firm capacity (i.e. marketers?) and not the pipes themselves are at fault for the large basis differentials between the basins and the CA delivery points. Whoever is blamed might not really matter. My gut feeling is that the other shoe is about to drop with calls for price caps on gas commodity prices into the West. This of course could affect years of effort on the gas marketing side in establishing competitive markets. Pipeline open access is of no avail if there is government intervention in the gas markets. Commissioner Massey Senator Feinstein and other Western Senators were saying some very concerning things about gas prices the impacts in their states and that something needed to be done. FERC responded with an announcement of their technical conference on interstate pipeline capacity and intrastate take away capacity (which by the way doesn't appear to address storage). Everyone wants an explanation as to why the basis differential is much higher than in other states since they thought it should only consist of transport costs. Ray -----------------

Body:: THE FRIDAY BURRITO ...more fun than a fortune cookie and at least as accurate. =0FAre those folks smoking crack?=0F he asked in an outrage. My friend = Ol=0F' Dave in Houston has trouble understanding the workings of our power business here in California. In fact so do I. Yesterday=0F's Joint Senate/Assembly Committee on Energy and Natural Resources did nothing to improve either Dave=0F's or my understanding of the national embarrassment California is perpetrating with electricity deregulation. =0FThe next thing you know they will be taking property and forcing utilities to build power plants and transmission=0F he mused between sips of Dixie longneck beer and chomps of jalapeno peppers. =0FCome to think of it Dave they did say something about that. Yeah=0F I recalled =0FSenator Peace was expounding on his favorite idea which is forcing the ISO or the utilities to build peakers and not let the market build them. I can=0F't remember if that was before or after he suggested to EOB Chairman Kahn that the ISO and the PX should be folded into State agencies under the direction of the Electric Oversight Board.=0F I know what you are thinking right now. The next thing you know California will have regulated retail rates. That recipe should be out of the PUC=0F's oven sometime next week. =0FWell the power marketers are jigging the system bidding up to the ISO=0F's bid cap. There is no way you can tell me that a generator planned to make $750/MWH in its pro forma=0F Dave added. =0FSo you agree with Herr (Hair) Peace! You don=0F't believe in markets=0F I retorted. = =0FOh I believe in them but I remember when I was short on a 300 MW trade and without any notice or advanced warning the price in the Midwest market went against me=0F Dave recalled. =0FI called everyone who I tra= ded with and they had nothing. I finally called XXXXX and I asked what will it cost for 50 MW?=0F =0FWhy didn=0F't you ask for 300?=0F I wondered. =0FI didn=0F't want to= show him my position. You get hosed when you show the buyer your position. Ask for 50 first=0F Dave chided. =0FWhat happened?=0F =0FOh they offered to sell for $150/MWH. I said I= =0F'd take it and then said I needed another fifty. He asked $300. I took that and he priced the next 50 MW at $600=0F lamented Dave. =0FHe just wanted to see how far he could push me. That=0F's what I mean when I say the traders are jigging it.=0F =0FBut Dave you old communist your forgetting the trading function is what mitigates the risk. The traders are the in between people who guess at the price. Sometimes they guess right and sometimes they guess wrong. But the damage or the reward is on their book not passed on to the ultimate consumer. It has nothing to do with the marginal cost of a generating plant.=0F And there you have it. Put in a price cap and the traders have a target for which to shoot. I can=0F't prove the following yet but I=0F'l= l wager with any of you that as the price cap level dips down the average trading price climbs even as the so-called =0Fdysfunctional=0F price spik= es are eliminated. Consumers get hosed and the fundamental economic principle is upheld which is one can never be made better off with the imposition of an additional constraint. I feel better already. Here is what is on our short agenda this week. >>> Things in the Mailbag >>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings @@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market >>> Odds & Ends (_!_) >>> Things in the Mailbag It has been awhile since we put the mail feedbag on and had a munch. Here is what my friends have been writing me. FPL Energy=0F's Steve Ponder was only too quick to tell me =0FPlease Gary=  no more whining about your computer. How old are you?? Is this the year you get the AARP letter??? A very depressing moment. Do you really not know how to spell Morro Bay??? Please let us know what is going on with your son's hockey team?? Don't forget the cigars for Moron??? Bay!!!!=0F It is good to have friends like Steve. They make the pain of separation so much easier. And Steve when you FPL guys get that Entergy merger sorted out in a dozen years or so you let us know. I want to participate in the name selection for the new entity. How about Fentergy PLus? Next from the PX=0F's Mark Hoppe who writes =0FAs you've heard from others I don't know quite how you manage to knock out all this material each week. The burrito is informative humorous and usually contains a sprinkle of irony tragedy (ISO Drama). Though you are usually neutral regarding the PX you are not unduly negative which I appreciate. I think we do a pretty good job over here and so often people in the industry forget the amount effort and challenge it took the PX to successfully open this market.=0F Thanks Mark. I just want you to know that my ability to write this stuff every week is not constrained by the facts or evidence. I have learned from watching Herr (Hair?) Peace that as long as you can talk (write too) fast and have conviction in your statements regardless of how groundless they may be you will have a willing and eager audience. A few weeks ago I received from the PX=0F's Jennifer Sherwood a note which she wants you to know are her opinions not necessarily the PX=0F's. It=0F's okay Jennifer. I paid Georgeyesterday the $20 I owed him for that sham Rose Bowl bet (remember? Stanford lost) and your opinions are cool with us. =0FJust curious - has anyone been comparing high unleaded prices to high CA electricity prices? What I mean is we are up in arms about how we should protect the unfortunate San Diego consumer who can't afford to keep the AC on. But what about the inflated unleaded gas prices the whole country has seen over the last few months? No effort is made by the government to shield the consumer from how much it costs to fill their gas tank. No mention is made of those who can't afford to drive to the grocery store because they can't afford the extra 15 or 20 cents a gallon. The costs are passed along to the consumer without pause. Granted there are differences between the unleaded market and the electricity market in terms of demand-side responsiveness but then again is it that much different to say =0F`I can't drive today because gas is too expensive=0F' vs. =0F`I can't turn up the AC today because it's too expensive.=0F'=0F Finally from one of our [secret] Washington readers and I am not telling who I received the following: =0FI ... broke down and listened to the [ISO Governing Board] discussion and vote. Ugh! I too noted that the speak fast was applied to everyone but Herr Peace. My goodness what a mess we have. I loved Jerry's picture in USA Today -- it spoke volumes. My sources at FERC tell me though that we should keep an eye out for {FERC Chairman] Hoecker to do something really ... [Censored] ... for political reasons. Given no Commission meetings til September the only way to act is by unanimous consent so I would hope he can't do all that much.=0F >>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report Several of you people commented to me that the ISO=0F's reply to the PUC/EOB report was very good. I decided to excerpt the best sections of it for the Burrito. The full document can be found on the ISO=0F's website. =0F... the [PUC/EOB] Report asserts that the suspected activities of certain generators on June 13 created frequency instability leading to the Bay Area blackouts the following day. In fact the events of June 13 and June 14 were completely independent of one another. The voltage instability on June 14 was caused by system conditions on that day alone -- exceptionally high loads insufficient generation in the specific local area and transmission constraints that prevented the import of generation from outside the area. =0FThe Report states that the ISO =0Fnever tried=0F to call upon consume= rs to reduce demand in order to avoid the Bay Area blackouts. In fact the ISO had in place on June 14 a number of demand response programs designed to reduce load including the Summer 2000 Demand Response Program under which customers have agreed through a prior solicitation to curtail energy use in exchange for a fee =0FThe Report makes a number of assertions concerning the prices paid by =0F`purchasers=0F' of energy as a result of the recent price spikes (e.g. $= 1.2 billion in the month of June alone). These assertions leave one with the mistaken impression that these prices reflect amounts actually paid by the UDCs and/or passed through to customers. However in determining the total cost of energy one must determine the impact of any forward contracts entered into by the UDCs in advance of the wholesale energy markets. These contracts which are designed to =0Flock-in=0F a specific price in advance of real-time or near real-time market activities are specifically designed to mitigate the impact of price volatility and are standard in all commodities markets. We have reason to believe that some of the UDCs were substantially hedged during the period of the recent price spikes. =0FIn a similar vein the reports asserts that California =0Fmight well= =0F have saved $110 million dollars had a $250 price cap been in place in May and June. This assertion assumes that all energy purchases would have been made at or below the $250 bid cap. In fact during times of peak demand when all of the state=0F's generation has been exhausted the ISO competes with neighboring regions for available generation. In order to secure the necessary power the ISO must purchase on a bilateral basis this energy from resources located outside of the ISO=0F's control area. =0FThe Report asserts that California power markets =0Fare not now competitive=0F and implies erroneously in our view that this is the normal state of affairs. It is not. The Market Surveillance Committee has noted that =0Fmarket power in the California energy market appears to arise primarily during periods of peak demand=0F and warned that demand growth would increase the incidence of market power during the summer of 2000. =0FThe Report asserts that the ISO is answerable only to a self-interested board and not to the citizens of California. This simply is not the case. The ISO is subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act and to the rules and regulations of FERC which dictate in part that wholesale energy rates must be just and reasonable and in the public interest. The ISO further operates under a detailed tariff reviewed and approved by FERC. Every change to our market design and virtually every aspect of the ISO=0F's business is subject to review and scrutiny by FERC. The FERC process provides substantial opportunities for input by the state agencies and such agencies have in fact been active participants in the FERC proceedings. =0FThe Report asserts that California supply conditions have been affected by restructuring and that somehow the restructuring choices have made California more vulnerable to supply shortages. This assertion is unfounded. Significant load growth in California and neighboring states coupled with a lack of significant infrastructure investment in both generation and transmission have caused this vulnerability. Restructuring has increased proposed power plant applications many fold. Only by immediate and sustained attention to streamlining approval and siting processes for both of these critical infrastructure elements will this significant shortage be addressed.=0F >>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings If you want to imagine a scary sight imagine then twelve California legislators gathering together in one hearing room to rectify the wrongs of electric restructuring. Also imagine as if you are in the Twilight Zone witnesses that are slow on their feet and reckless in their facts. Then you get a glimpse of what yesterday=0F's Joint Senate/Assembly hearing was like. It started over two hours late. The Senate was busy congratulating one of their own who is term-limited out next session and they wanted to heap on the glory. That said the show began with CEC Commissioner Bill Keese. Mr. Keese has one story and regardless how well he tells it and he does it is always the same story. It is the heat storm story. One can imagine in the heat storm story a lead character who is a single-mom call her Lady-Bird Bowen who travels across an angry land with her precocious pre-teen child Stevie Wonderboy. They are searching for electric power plants in the dessert which by the grace of God have been shipped to other countries which have more liberal returns on investment. Being the first speaker Mr. Keese took at least half the heat (storm) of the day. The rage of the Energy Fuhrer was palpable. Last week San Diegans shed 350 MW of load last week to save the entire system and did not receive one penny of compensation (I=0F'm not making that up ... He said it). He is sick of hearing about demand management as being a solution for the problem over the last five years and he is about done listening. People in San Diego are depressed by the sudden price hikes. Yikes! Keese did mention that the California reserve margin has sunk to 7% but in neighboring Arizona the reserve margin is -1% or -2%!! Mr. Keese correctly pointed out that electric power is not solely a California problem it is a regional problem. One member of the Committee asked what the legislature could do to speed up the power plant siting and construction process? Keese referred to Governor Gray Davis=0F' Executive Order issued last week to which the CEC plans to respond soon date uncertain that lays out a 6 month permitting time line. The six months are enough if the applicant has the land secured zoning okayed transmission access and air offsets. Hmmmmmm. That alone might take six months before you get to the CEC. The next panel included Mr. Kahn of the EOB and Ms. Lynch. I went too hard on her last week calling her Let=0F's Do Lynch. That was a 0.8 TPC. Sorry. I promise to be nicer starting now. The Energy Fuhrer instructed Ms. Lynch to use her authority to order SDG&E to divert the pass through of funds from the customers to the PX until the dysfunction of the market is cured. Put it in an escrow account. Ms Lynch promised to review this option at her August 21 PUC Meeting where she will enact SDG&E rate caps (told you). The star of the day I thought was FERC General Counsel Doug Smith. Mr. Smith comes to Sacramento. Isn=0F't that a switch? Mr. Smith came in place of Mr. Hoecker thank the Lord. Mr. Smith put into FERC-eese what these 12 legislators could not get through their heads any other way. The 12 angry legislators were looking for a way for FERC to declare the wholesale market as non-competitive and then ask the generators to give back the money they over collected. When can we do that? Mr. Smith answered as only a FERC attorney can answer. There is a process. It takes time. You must have evidence. FERC uses a three-part criteria for assessing whether or not market based rates are allowable. It=0F's based on market concentration and dominance not the existence of high prices. You would have to sue FERC in federal court and the best you could hope for is for FERC to reconsider its decision upon remand from the US Court of Appeals. Slowly the wind came out of the sails of the gang of 12. They were stumped. Herr (Hair?) Peace screamed couldn=0F't you Mr. Smith of FERC today use your authority to declare the markets non-competitive that generators who had market based rates have exercised market power and retro-actively implement a $250 rate cap across the Western region? Like a wheezing accordion Mr. Smith played back and forth the familiar strains of music like a solo street musician on the corner. Back and forth: the process the process the process. There have been times in the past I hated the process at FERC. Today I have a renewed respect for what process affords me and you ... Freedom from the tyranny of a mob. For the remainder of the hearing they focused on remedies that could be undertaken by the PUC. >>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California @@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market Well the official title is =0FOrder Instituting Investigation into the Functioning of the Wholesale Electric Market and Associated Impact on Retail Electric Rates in the Services Territory of San Diego Gas & Electric Company=0F. I like my title better. This Order or OII was issued at the last business meeting of the Commission on August 3. It calls for an investigation of the wholesale markets responses from the three UDCs and a pre-hearing conference in San Diego on August 29 at the San Diego Convention Center. Here are the questions the PUC wishes us to address: =0F=07 What bill payment options should be provided to assist residential a= nd small commercial customers? (What does this have to do with the functioning of the wholesale market?) =0F=07 Should SDG&E be authorized to participate in bilateral contracts or other supply procurement activities? How should the Commission assess reasonableness? Are SDG&E=0F's purchasing activities serving its customers on just and reasonable terms? =0F=07 What is SDG&E=0F's obligation to minimize energy costs for its curre= nt customers? =0F=07 How should the Commission Attorney General EOB ISO and PX coordinate to investigate wholesale market events behaviors and irregularities? How should state/federal concerns be addressed? =0F=07 What are the causes of the price increases? Are anticompeititve practices causing some of the price increases? Are there mechanisms the Commission can employ to make ratepayers whole? >>> Odds & Ends (_!_) As promised last week I have a message from our event coordinator Barb Ennis regarding the upcoming WPTF General Meeting on October 5 and 6.

The object of humor notwithstanding and seeing how the flow of new material has slowed a bit my wife provided this week=0F's laughter. She didn=0F't have to attend the Senate hearing. Subject: The Brilliance of Women There were 11 people hanging onto a rope that came down from a helicopter. Ten were men and one was a woman. They all decided that one person should get off because if they didn't the rope would break and everyone would die. No one could decide who should go so finally the Woman gave a really touching speech saying how she would give up her life to save the others because women were used to giving up things for their husbands and children and giving in to men. All of the men started clapping. Have a great weekend y=0F'all [applause] gba

The EEF is an international leadership exchange program that promotes international understanding and productivity through the exchange of information ideas and perspectives among emerging leaders throughout the world. Ken Lay is a member of the EEF Board of Trustees. Enron will be hosting three EEF visitors from India on Wednesday October 18 2000: Mr. Sanjeev Ahluwalia Secretary of the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission Mr. Sreenivasan Jain Newscaster New Delhi TV and Mr. Jawed Usmani Joint Secretary Office of the Prime Minister. I am preparing a day program at Enron for the three persons two of whom - Sanjeev Ahluwalia and Jawed Usmani - are interested in learning more about the US regulatory environment. Mr. Ahluwalia also wants to learn more about US environmental policy in both local and global contexts (please refer to attached bios for more details). I would be grateful if either Steve or Jim could meet with the above persons for 30-45 minutes to discuss regulatory issues. Similarly if Mike could be available to meet with Mr. Ahluwalia re environmental issues. Please let me know if you are available either between 10:00 - 12:00 noon or 3:30 - 5:00 p.m. on Wednesday October 18 2000. If you are unavailable it would be appreciated if one of your other colleagues could assist in this regard. Many thanks Johan - AHLUWALIA bio.doc - CV1.doc

Subject:: nan
Body:: When we have described the problems and solutions for California we have focussed on generation siting and flexibility to hedge. We have stayed away from transmission issues on the assumption that California with its ISO and PX does not suffer from the same discrimination issues as other parts of the country. Is this true? Does California's system layer in priorities for utility use of the system -- eg doesn't PG&E control path 15? Does that control provide advantageous access to PG&E? Are there other examples and are there links between these preferences and the current problems in California? As we are trying to convert reliability and pricing concerns into FERC action these would be helpful arguments to have available to us.

Subject:: Re: Greenpeace letters to Enron Europe concerning our position on
 Kyoto
Body:: I think Jeff should be the point person on putting the response together on this (and future air and climate change position inquiries). Jeff - please make sure you get the comments of all involved. Jeffrey Keeler 04/17/2001 05:02 PM To: Michael Terraso/OTS/Enron@ENRON Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron Kelly Kimberly/Enron Communications@Enron Communications Lauren Iannarone/NY/ECT@ECT Catherine McKalip-Thompson/Enron Communications@Enron Communications Lisa Jacobson/ENRON@enronXgate Mark Palmer/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Subject: Re: Greenpeace letters to Enron Europe concerning our position on Kyoto All: I would like to discuss how we might respond to this letter from Greenpeace if at all. The letter is attached way at the bottom of this e-mail and was received in several Enron European offices as a copy of what was sent to Jeff Skilling and other CEOs of major companies. I have not confirmed our receipt of such a letter from any of you but am assuming it was delivered. I think we could respond in a very positive constructive manner to Greenpeace based on the statements we've already documented and the strategies we are developing. Lisa Jacobson and I are currently working on developing some tighter climate change and clean air messages that we can use in multiple areas ASAP -- upcoming Ken Lay speeches and interactions with the Administration revising the Statement for the 2001 Corporate Responsibility Report Enron Business articles and other internal uses responses to environmental group inquiries and shareholder meeting Q&A and use in everyday speeches and advocacy work. The Greenpeace questions are tricky and set up no-win answers for the most part. I doubt they will get any direct answers to questions like: Does your company support President Bush in his opposition to the protocol? In my opinion we can respond to Greenpeace without directly responding to these types of questions. Addressing Kyoto directly is a slippery slope -- its best to stick with the solution-oriented approach we've always taken. For this reason I was a bit concerned to see in the e-mail chain below a characterization of Mark Palmer's statement on Kyoto (given to Jackie Gentile in London) -- Enron has always taken the view that the Kyoto protocol was not a workable solution to dealing with CO2 emissions. However it is not the principles behind Kyoto that we take issue with rather it is the vehicle that has been devised to deliver the results. I believe it is dangerous to make such statements for a number of reasons -- Greenpeace would absolutely beat us over the head with it Friends of the Earth could step up its shareholder initiatives etc. Also this sets you up for a number of follow up questions that I don't think we have answers to like: What about Kyoto is not workable? What would make it workable and would we help make it workable? If not Kyoto what is Enron's preferred vehicle? I'd really rather stay with a constructive solution-oriented approach and avoid reference to Kyoto altogether. I will talk with Kate Bauer in Enron Europe about this but I think we need to decide on a global corporate-wide response to Greenpeace. I would be happy to set up a quick conference call on the subject or just field comments by e-mail -- whatever works best. Thoughts?

Subject:: I would like to help you succeed with this challenge.
Body:: Jeff The attached Rough & Tumble is an electronic clipping service targeted at California politicos and policy wonks. It carried the LA Times version of the Lockyer comments a couple days ago. Today it has the NY Times article on Ken Lay. It's pretty clear that in the near-term Enron and it's leadership are at risk of being engulfed in a political firestorm which bounces from coast to coast gaining strength each step of the way. However it is the long-term challenge that draws my attention. From my research to date I am left with the strong impression that the Enron's capacity for acquiring distilling and assessing business information is much stronger than it's abilities with public policy information. Ken Lay you and your team have shaped a innovative and entrepreneurial company rooted in agile arbitrage of business knowledge. Like Goldman Sachs it is hard for the man on the street to understand precisely what Enron does. However because of your presence in businesses that play out daily in homes schools and small businesses Enron will be scrutinized in a way the Goldman couldn't imagine in it's worst nightmares. From my perspective the success of Enron's business model demands a sure footing in both business and public policy. Going forward these two areas of expertise need become intertwined to assure the success of the highly sophisticated ethical innovative and insightful global corporation known as Enron.

Now they must decide whether those companies have done anything illegal. State Attorney General Bill Lockyer said Thursday he believes the evidence ``strongly suggests'' power companies acted illegally to drive up prices. He has said that he would love to put top energy executives in jail. Brandon Bailey and Chris O'Brien in the San Jose Mercury -- 5/25/01 Davis blackout warnings -- a significant policy change aimed at minimizing business and consumer disruptions Gov. Gray Davis ordered state officials Thursday to enact a three-tier blackout warning system. Forecasts of blackouts will be issued 48 hours beforehand Davis said. General areas will be identified in warnings issued 24 hours before likely outages. Precise locations will be announced an hour before the power is cut he said. Dan Morain and Nancy Vogel in the Los Angeles Times Greg Lucas and Lynda Gledhill in the San Francisco Chronicle Noam Levey and Dion Nissenbaum in the San Jose Mercury John Hill in the Sacramento Bee Ed Mendel in the San Diego Union Robert Garrett in the Riverside Press Michael Coit in the Santa Rosa Press -- 5/25/01 Davis' popularity plunges in poll -- With California's energy crisis mounting Democratic Gov. Gray Davis has suffered a precipitous fall in his job approval rating and image among state residents according to a Field Poll released yesterday. For the first time since his November 1998 election more Californians have an unfavorable view of Davis' performance than favorable. Carla Marinucci in the San Francisco Chronicle Hallye Jordan in the San Jose Mercury John Marelius in the San Diego Union -- 5/25/01 Poll puts Riordan Davis in tight race -- Californians' assessment of Gov. Gray Davis has plummeted drastically as he has struggled to handle the state energy crisis placing outgoing Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan in a virtual dead heat with him for the 2002 governor's race according to a Field Poll released Thursday. Though Riordan has given no clear indication that he intends to run for governor 42 percent of registered voters said they would support the Republican mayor should he challenge Davis the Democratic incumbent. Forty-three percent said they would vote for Davis. Emily Bazar in the Sacramento Bee -- 5/25/01 California to gain from GOP's loss -- A single party switch in the Senate on Thursday handed California's Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer new clout with key leadership roles likely on issues ranging from military base closings to environmental cleanups. Vermont Sen. James Jeffords' announcement that he was quitting the Republican Party to be an independent affiliated with Democrats set up a takeover in which the Democrats with a de facto 51-49 majority will assume all Senate leadership posts and committee chairs. Bill Hillburg in the Los Angeles Daily News -- 5/25/01 PUC and 'baseline' rates -- Nine days after structuring the largest electricity rate increase in California history state regulators on Thursday launched a reexamination of the unpopular baselines used to determine how much each residential customer will pay. If the indicators are revised upward as most expect that would grant some customers relief from the rate hike but could necessitate future ones to generate enough revenue for power purchases. Tim Reiterman in the Los Angeles Times Michael Bazeley in the San Jose Mercury Carrie Peyton in the Sacramento Bee -- 5/25/01 Enron Bush -- Curtis H?bert Jr. Washington's top electricity regulator said he had barely settled into his new job this year when he had an unsettling telephone conversation with Kenneth L. Lay the head of the nation's largest electricity trader the Enron Corporation. Mr. H?bert chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said that Mr. Lay a close friend of President Bush's offered him a deal: If he changed his views on electricity deregulation Enron would continue to support him in his new job. Lowell Bergman and Jeff Gerth in the New York Times -- 5/25/01 Lockyer comes out swinging at oilman Davis has plenty of company in depths of poll -- The reaction from Gov. Gray Davis' camp to yesterday's poll showing him in the dumper was quick and blunt. Tell me something I don't already know adviser Paul Maslin said after being hit with the news that the latest Field Poll showed Davis' job rating down 18 points since January. None of this is news to us Maslin said. Matier & Ross in the San Francisco Chronicle -- 5/25/01 Water and power -- The California Public Utilities Commission authorized an increase in American States Water Co.'s rates at the Bear Valley Electric customer service area of its Southern California Water Co. unit to recover $2.4 million in deferred electric power costs. The amount will be recovered from customers over a five-year period. Sam Favate Dow Jones Newswires -- 5/25/01 Muni power -- Gov. Davis said he received a pledge Thursday from municipal utility officials that their agencies will sell excess power to the state at prices much lower than in the past. Despite simmering resentment at subjecting their customers to rolling blackouts the muni officials promised Davis they will keep cooperating with the state. Municipal utility customers including those in the Modesto Turlock and Merced irrigation districts will continue to face power blackouts officials said afterward. Jim Miller in the Modesto Bee -- 5/25/01 Edison merit raises -- Southern California Edison which is struggling to stay out of bankruptcy will hand out $19 million in merit raises to its 12000 employees today but top executives will forgo the raises because of the company's financial woes. Edison has doled out hefty merit raises in the past. But this year the company will pay the minimum under its variable compensation program which rewards employees for meeting certain company goals. Kate Berry in the Orange County Register -- 5/25/01 Cities with own utilities ask FERC to bar blackouts -- More than 15 California cities that have municipal utilities including Anaheim are asking federal regulators to exempt them from electricity blackouts ordered by the state's Independent System Operator. The city of Vernon was first to ask the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to rule that the ISO cannot force it to participate in California's rolling blackouts to serve demand in other areas. Vernon's utility argued that it was ridiculous to subject its customers to blackouts when it had enough power to keep the lights on. Amy Strahan Butler in the Orange County Register -- 5/25/01 Utility tax windfall -- As electricity rates rise consumers will get hit with a double whammy because of an obscure utility bill tax that many California cities have quietly been collecting for years. A member of the state Board of Equalization charges that some cities will reap windfalls from the utility user tax and he is backing a grass-roots movement to slash or repeal it. Few local governments are hurrying to forfeit the money saying that they need it to pay their own higher energy bills. Wendy Thermos in the Los Angeles Times -- 5/25/01 An air of discontent over diesel backups -- Gov. Gray Davis said yesterday that he may ask companies to run their emergency generators during Stage 3 electricity alerts as a way to stave off blackouts. And when blackouts do occur thousands of tractor-trailer-size generators will whir to life powering elevators and lights hospital equipment even assembly lines. But that prospect has created major concerns. Most of those industrial- strength generators run on diesel oil a highly polluting fuel. Because they were intended for emergency use generators have escaped most environmental regulations. What's more they are likely to be called into service on the hottest smoggiest days of the year. Carolyn Said in the San Francisco Chronicle -- 5/25/01 Power price controls -- The House Energy and Commerce Committee delayed consideration of a major energy bill Thursday as Republicans and Democrats met privately to explore a possible compromise placing price controls on soaring wholesale electric rates on the West Coast. The negotiations hinted at a possible watershed change in the Republicans' staunch opposition to price controls. An earlier effort to include such controls in the bill turned contentious and was defeated on a mostly partisan vote in subcommittee. Les Blumenthal in the Sacramento Bee -- 5/25/01 For seniors the heat can kill doctors warn -- As summer slouches toward Sacramento amid a drumbeat of calls to conserve electricity doctors and advocates for the elderly are sounding a counter-theme. Heat can kill. And most often it kills seniors. Year after year heat waves around the United States are deadlier than hurricanes or floods tornadoes or earthquakes according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Carrie Peyton and Nancy Weaver Teichert in the Sacramento Bee -- 5/25/01 Outages could be fatal for disabled -- Around the clock an electric pump supplies supplementary oxygen to 66-year-old Benny Pritchett's diseased lungs. Pritchett worries that a rolling blackout might kill him. The electricity goes out I'm a dead man said the San Bernardino apartment dweller and former chain-smoker. I've got a (back-up) oxygen tank. It lasts two hours. When it runs out I'm dead. Rolling blackouts aren't expected to last much more than an hour say Southern California Edison officials but their Web site recommends that any customer dependent on electrically operated life-support equipment buy an emergency generator. Richard Brooks in the Riverside Press -- 5/25/01 Gasoline prices -- Average gasoline prices statewide are nearly $2 a gallon and the Los Angeles region has once again been dubbed the nation's hub of traffic congestion. So what's a good Southern Californian to do? Plan a road trip. Hugo Martin in the Los Angeles Times -- 5/25/01 Offshore drilling -- A federal advisory panel Thursday urged the Bush administration to identify the five most promising areas to drill for natural gas in coastal waters off California and other states which have been off limits to drilling for nearly 20 years. Citing the nation's unmet energy needs the advisory group to Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton suggested that locating the top reservoirs of natural gas would help determine if there are grounds and support for a limited lifting of moratoriums on offshore drilling. The ban now covers 610 million acres of ocean off the Pacific Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Kenneth Weiss in the Los Angeles Times -- 5/25/01 Judge demands straight answers from El Paso Corp. -- An irate judge threatened yesterday to subpoena the president of a Texas energy firm accused of manipulating California natural gas prices saying he couldn't get straight answers out of another high-ranking company executive. The eruption by Curtis Wagner Jr. the administrative law judge presiding over a federal probe of alleged market manipulation by El Paso Corp. prompted the company to schedule voluntary testimony by President William Wise today in Washington D.C. Bernadette Tansey in the San Francisco Chronicle -- 5/25/01 El Paso executive and collusion -- The head of a Texas energy conglomerate personally endorsed a deal between two subsidiaries accused of manipulating the natural gas market in Southern California to drive up prices a senior official of the firm testified Thursday. The testimony in a trial-like hearing before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission raised questions about whether top officials of Houston-based El Paso Corp. violated FERC rules requiring arm's-length dealings within a corporate family. The admission by El Paso executive Ralph Eads marked a shift from his previous testimony and was elicited through sharp questioning by an angry judge who threatened to subpoena Eads' boss. Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar in the Los Angeles Times -- 5/25/01 Riverside no blackouts -- Southern California Edison won't immediately challenge Riverside's decision against using rolling blackouts to save energy this summer a spokesman said Thursday. Edison doesn't care how the city of Riverside curtails its energy use as long as the city makes the required cuts during a statewide power shortage Edison spokesman Steve Hansen said. Dan Lee in the Riverside Press -- 5/25/01 Energy crisis hits muni bonds -- Investors fled the California municipal bond market last month taking with them a net $3.5 billion their departure prompted in part by the state's energy crisis and taxes a fund analysis firm said Thursday. The withdrawals in April marked the worst such outflow in years and it comes as the state is preparing this August to issue a record $13.4 billion in bonds to bail out utilities. Loretta Kalb in the Sacramento Bee -- 5/25/01 With a perfectly negative crisis record Davis desperate for a win -- So far Gov. Gray Davis has amassed an unblemished record in his handling of the energy crisis. Not one major aspect of the situation has moved in the positive direction Davis said -- and clearly hoped -- it would to wit: Dan Walters in the Sacramento Bee -- 5/25/01 Hot days don't cut the power -- A combination of factors kept the state's beleaguered system out of the red this time. The heat wave didn't hit all areas of the state at the same time and cooler weather in the Pacific Northwest got power flowing from that region to California again. Also there have been no new power-plant malfunctions and many of the smaller generating facilities that were AWOL a few weeks ago when the last blackouts hit are operating again. A huge potential contributor to blackout avoidance -- but one that's difficult to quantify -- is conservation. Jack Katzanek in the Riverside Press -- 5/25/01 Long Beach Boeing layoffs -- Reflecting a sagging market for 100-seat jetliners the Boeing Co. will lay off about 600 employees this year at its commercial factory in Long Beach the company confirmed Thursday. That decision followed an internal study by Boeing that was completed earlier this year said spokesman Warren Lamb who did not elaborate. Ian Hanigan in the Long Beach Press -- 5/25/01 Hahn -- His job is to both prosecute and defend. And with that tricky mandate Los Angeles City Atty. James Kenneth Hahn for 16 years has led a law office that in sheer numbers would rank among the biggest in the country. With some 450 attorneys responsibility for both criminal and civil cases and an annual budget of $70 million the office like the city it serves is big diverse complex. But a review of Hahn's record suggests that his performance has been mixed--deliberate and plodding pragmatic and obstinate. Greg Krikorian and Patrick McGreevey in the Los Angeles Times -- 5/25/01 Villaraigosa and Hahn and housing -- It doesn't fire up voters like a stump speech on crime schools or traffic congestion. But the sheer magnitude of the city's housing shortage has placed it squarely--albeit quietly--on the agendas of both candidates running for mayor of Los Angeles. Eight years of a widely criticized lack of mayoral attention to the housing problem combined with a high concentration of low-wage workers has earned Los Angeles a reputation as one of the most unaffordable overcrowded metropolitan centers in the country plagued by low home ownership rates and slum conditions. Lee Romney in the Los Angeles Times -- 5/25/01 Villaraigosa and Hahn annd crime and gangs -- Mayoral candidates Antonio Villaraigosa and City Attorney James Hahn continued Thursday to compare their plans to deal with crime as they near the June 5 runoff election. Hahn filing papers in court to seek injunctions against two Wilmington gangs touted his efforts over the past several years to control gang activity throughout the city. The root of the violence is drugs and ... for turf and control Hahn said of the two gangs -- but which he added applies to most gangs in the city. Rick Orlov in the Los Angeles Daily News -- 5/25/01 Dean Andal -- State Board of Equalization member Dean Andal is expected to announce today that he plans to run for state controller next year. The 41-year-old Republican from Stockton said he will run on a platform that includes lowering utility taxes paid by residents and businesses in Los Angeles which are 10% and 12.5% respectively. The story is in the Los Angeles Times -- 5/25/01 Jim Rogan -- President Bush on Thursday nominated former Congressman James Rogan to be undersecretary of commerce for intellectual property and director of the U.S. Trademark Office. The job pays $130200 a year. Bush's selection of Rogan which will require confirmation by the Senate could be a positive sign for Hollywood which has been lobbying for increased enforcement of copyright laws including a crackdown on Internet piracy. Bill Hillburg in the Los Angeles Daily News -- 5/25/01 Living wage -- While attorneys speculated on the constitutionality of Santa Monica's newly approved living wage law hotel housekeeper Blanca Mendez was just hoping Thursday that she can benefit if a raise to $10.50 an hour goes into effect next summer at large downtown and beach-side businesses. It would be fantastic said Mendez who now earns $8.50 an hour after seven years at the Streamline Moderne-style Shangri-La Hotel near the ocean. The economy is very difficult everything is getting expensive like gas like energy. Oscar Johnson and Ofelia Casillas in the Los Angeles Times -- 5/25/01 9 tribes' casino plans put on hold -- Gov. Gray Davis won't approve any more agreements with Indian tribes to allow casinos until the federal courts resolve a legal challenge to California's Indian gaming law. So far the governor's moratorium on new Indian gaming compacts announced in a letter to nine California tribes doesn't appear to affect three Sonoma County tribes that have announced plans for casinos. But it could delay the progress of the nine other tribes that have asked the governor to negotiate gaming agreements including the Round Valley tribe in Mendocino County. Steve Hart in the Santa Rosa Press -- 5/25/01 Charity foundations growth -- California's charitable foundation assets--which were relatively modest as recently as two decades ago--are now growing at a rate faster than those in the rest of the country according to a study by the new USC Center on Philanthropy and Public Policy. In 1978 California held 8% of national foundation assets in 1998 it accounted for 14% the study said. During the same period the state's share of foundation grants grew from 7% to 11% of total giving nationwide it said. California is catching up and jumping forward said Marcia K. Sharp a research fellow at the USC Center on Philanthropy and Public Policy and a co-author of the study. Anne-Marie O'Connor in the Los Angeles Times -- 5/25/01 Documents seized in S.F. minority contract probe are inadmissible -- In a potential blow to prosecutors a U.S. judge said that federal investigators violated a San Francisco city official's privacy rights when they searched her office looking for evidence of fraud in a city minority contracting program. The FBI seized hundreds of pages of records from the San Francisco Human Rights Commission office of chief contract compliance officer Zula Jones in August 1999. Chuck Finnie and Lance Williams in the San Francisco Chronicle -- 5/25/01 Feinstein fast-tracks water storage plans -- California can't forestall a water crisis without building more storage facilities Sen. Dianne Feinstein said yesterday in responding to environmental critics of her bill to reauthorize the CalFed ecosystem restoration program. Eric Brazil in the San Francisco Chronicle Michael Gardner in the San Diego Union -- 5/25/01 Californians' recycling efforts hit skids -- Californians are recycling a lower percentage of redeemable plastic glass and aluminum beverage containers than they have in more than a decade the state Department of Conservation reported Thursday. While officials note the recycling drop is partially due to an increasing number of products available for redemption they also point to research suggesting consumers' habits may be slipping. Ed Fletcher in the Sacramento Bee -- 5/25/01 UC admissions policy -- A UC Berkeley request to be exempted from a University of California admissions policy is creating concern among administrators and faculty who object to looking at one campus in isolation. Instead they said the Berkeley request probably should be folded into a systemwide review of admissions already under way. Tanya Schevitz in the San Francisco Chronicle -- 5/25/01 Irvine cash crop: business -- Irvine One of the largest commercial developments in the county could be built in the next five to seven years replacing checkered fields of strawberries and other crops. The 670 acres of fields and a scattering of industrial buildings just outside Irvine's northeastern border is large enough to host 12 Disneylands but The Irvine Co. has other plans. Laura Corbin Jennifer Hieger and Elizabeth Aguilera in the Orange County Register -- 5/25/01 Like a Rolling Tone -- It looked like a scene from the hotel karaoke lounge where the microphone-hogging guy won't stop belting Tom Jones tunes and a few cocktail-sipping patrons keep their eyes glued to their drinks in embarrassment. But it was official state business at the state Capitol on Thursday when members of the Assembly attempted to pay tribute to Bob Dylan on his 60th birthday by feebly singing along with his 1973 recording of Forever Young. Lesli A. Maxwell in the Fresno Bee -- 5/25/01 Joe Lockhart -- Barely six months after joining Oracle Corp. as a communications consultant to chief executive Larry Ellison former White House press secretary Joe Lockhart has left the database software firm. Both sides yesterday denied a rift between the two men and blamed Lockhart's frequent trips from his home in Washington D.C. to Oracle's Redwood Shores headquarters for the departure.

Subject:: California Refund Proceeding Privileged and Confidential Attorney
 Work Product Attorney-Client Communication
Body:: In our litigation meeting last Tuesday we learned that netting of spot purchases and sales is of paramount importance in limiting our exposure to refunds under the FERC's July 26 Order in both the California and Pacific Northwest proceedings. However in the California proceeding we are also afforded the opportunity in the Order to offset our receivables against any refund that would otherwise have to be paid by us. Also to the extent that our receivables exceed the refund amount the Order provides for payment of interest to us in accordance with CFR Section 35.19a. At present I am aware of the existence of three receivables. As you will recall I mentioned at Tuesday's meeting that we should be able to treat as a receivable for purposes of offset the revenues due us from the application of the CAISO underscheduling penalty. I communicated the possibility of offsetting this receivable against any potential refund at this mornings Western Wholesale conference call and subsequent research conducted by Alan Comnes indicates that the CAISO owes us $30MM as per the CAISO's own numbers. The CAISO also owes us approximately $40MM due to nonpayment for one to two months of business. These two figures alone totalling approximately $70MM exceed the estimate of our potential exposure in the California proceeding. Finally the negative CTC issue is another receivable due us by IOU's that under the plain language of the Order could potentially be used to offset any refund amount. I am not aware of the magnitude of this receivable but do understand that there are some sensitivities regarding this issue including concerns about revealing the amount of the credit due us. It is likely that the amount would become public if it is presented in the California proceeding. Please give us your thoughts as to the use of the CTC receivable to offset potential refunds in the California proceeding.

EMSHWILLER Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL LOS ANGELES -- California may be struggling to keep its lights on but one thing there is no shortage of is accusations over who is to blame for an electricity crisis that has sent power prices skyrocketing. In recent days top California officials have stepped up their rhetoric against a handful of merchant power companies many of them Texas-based that supply the state with much of its juice. Gov. Gray Davis says companies such as Reliant Energy Inc. of Houston have engaged in unconscionable price-gouging. Loretta Lynch president of the California Public Utilities Commission and a Davis appointee proclaims that a cartel of electricity producers has created artificial shortages. Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante is backing a bill that would make energy price-fixing a felony and as a private citizen he is suing several major power producers in Los Angeles state court. Investigations Under Way About half a dozen investigations are being conducted by entities ranging from state legislative committees to the California attorney general's office. So far these probes -- some of which have been under way for months -- haven't yet yielded either civil or criminal charges. While the energy suppliers are generating unconscionable profits the question remains whether they are illegal profits says California Attorney General Bill Lockyer who has offered rewards of as much as hundreds of millions of dollars for information about lawbreaking in the energy business. Mr. Lockyer says he believes his office will eventually file civil charges against suppliers. He would very much like to add criminal counts. I would love to personally escort [Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth] Lay to an 8 x 10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says 'Hi my name is Spike honey'  adds Mr. Lockyer. Houston-based Enron is a major energy-trading company. Like other such firms Enron has denied wrongdoing in the California market. Mark Palmer Enron's vice president for corporate communications said Mr. Lockyer's comment about Mr. Lay  is so counterproductive that it doesn't merit a response. Investigators and academics say there is abundant evidence that individual firms have been exercising market power. This term is used to denote efforts to influence wholesale-electricity prices such as by withholding supplies. The California Independent System Operator or ISO which manages the state's electric transmission grid estimates that by exercising market power suppliers may have added about $6.8 billion to the cost of electricity in the state since early last year. A single firm exercising such power isn't necessarily illegal says Severin Borenstein director of the University of California Energy Institute. If a company is a large supplier in the state and you're not exercising market power you are not doing your job on behalf of shareholders he says. Mr. Borenstein and others say that there are steps that should be taken against suppliers. They note that under federal power law the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission can order refunds for wholesale prices that are above just and reasonable levels. So far FERC has tentatively ordered California suppliers to make tens of millions of dollars of such refunds as part of that agency's ongoing inquiry into the California market. Critics of the suppliers and FERC say the refunds should be in the billions of dollars. The power industry not surprisingly says there is nothing to accusations of price manipulation or collusion. Executives point to a botched state-utility-deregulation plan that relies heavily on volatile spot-market purchases. Suppliers note that over the past decade California didn't build enough new power plants to keep up with demand growth. The allegations of manipulation are a lot of sound and fury and they won't produce anything says Gary Ackerman executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum an industry trade group. Investigations Aplenty In the year since California's energy deregulation plan began resulting in higher prices and even blackouts a flurry of investigations has gotten under way. Here are the main ones: Agency ????Investigation Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ????Whether generators are charging more than just and reasonable rates as demanded by the Federal Power Act whether El Paso Corp. used its position as a major natural-gas supplier to the state to illegally drive up the price of fuel used to generate electricity. California Public Utilities Commission and the State Attorney General ????Whether generators and power traders have acted illegally through collusion or other means to artificially inflate electricity prices. PUC and California Independent System Operator ????Whether generation plants were shut down for spurious reasons in order to create supply shortages and thus to raise electricity prices. California Electricity Oversight Board ????Whether patterns of bidding and pricing in California's electricity auction indicate collusive or otherwise illegal behavior. Sources: state and federal agencies Power generators also point to sharp increases in some of their costs particularly natural gas which is a major power-plant fuel. This rise in natural-gas prices also has set off a flurry of investigations over possible manipulation. One such case involving El Paso Corp. Houston is the subject of probes by federal and state officials. El Paso denies any wrongdoing. While power-industry officials say they have been cooperating with the investigations law-enforcement officials say they have hit some roadblocks. For instance Mr. Lockyer's office has gone to San Francisco state court to enforce subpoenas against Reliant Houston-based Dynegy Inc. and Southern Co. and Mirant Corp. both of Atlanta after the companies resisted turning over certain business documents they deemed confidential. Investigators have zeroed in on the increased frequency with which plants are going out of service for unscheduled outages. At times several thousand fewer megawatts of capacity are available than a year ago. A thousand megawatts can power about one million homes. 'Forced Outage' Rate Rises Generators say that this increased forced outage rate shows that tight supplies over the past year have required them to run plants some of them more than 40 years old for long periods without routine maintenance. This combination has produced more breakdowns. Plants have been running flat out says Tom Williams a spokesman for Duke Energy Co. Charlotte N.C. which says that its California power plants produced 50% more electricity in 2000 than in 1999. At the same time during periods of lower demand the number of unplanned outages often seems to rise enough to keep supplies tight says Frank Wolak a Stanford University professor and chairman of the ISO's market surveillance committee. Clearly something is going on here. However he and others say that it is almost impossible to tell why a particular pipe failed or whether such a failure was a legitimate reason to reduce output. Some of the most intriguing evidence to date about forced outages surfaced in a federal case. FERC officials said an investigation had raised questions about whether two major power companies had taken plants out of service in order to reap higher electricity prices. The charges against AES Corp. Arlington Va. which owns the plants and Williams Cos. Tulsa Okla. which markets their output asserted that those actions allowed the companies to reap an extra $10.8 million in revenue. In one instance according to case filings a Williams employee indicated to AES officials that his firm wouldn't financially penalize AES for extending an outage at one plant. This conversation which was voluntarily divulged by Williams could be an indication of collusion. Williams and AES settled the case without admitting any wrongdoing by paying back $8 million to the ISO and by taking certain other measures. A Williams spokeswoman says the employee who talked to AES was counseled not to enter into any conversations of that nature in the future. Another issue raised by the FERC case touched on maintenance procedures. According to the filings AES stopped doing a certain procedure to keep its plant's cooling system from getting clogged. The clogging of the system was cited as a reason for one of the forced outages. Mark Woodruff president of the AES unit that operates the plant in question says the company substituted what it felt was an equally effective maintenance procedure. If someone was looking to keep supplies tight and prices high changes in maintenance procedures would be an easy way to ensure that plants particularly old ones have frequent forced outages says a senior utility-industry executive. By restricting maintenance resources he says an operator can simply allow a plant to take itself out of service. Write to John R.

Now California has power watches and power warnings to guide residents through days of summer blackouts. ??Beginning next week forecasters who look at variables like electricity loads and transmission constraints instead of wind speeds and barometric pressure will lay the odds of blackouts being imposed the next day. If those odds appear to be 50-50 or greater they will issue a power warning. ??In addition the California Independent System Operator will issue 30-minute advisories to warn state residents that blackouts are probably imminent. ??The new warnings are in response to complaints that blackouts have taken people by surprise. ??What we're hearing from the public is they wanted a little more heads-up when it comes to blackouts said ISO spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle. ??Meanwhile Gov. Gray Davis was in Chicago Monday to hear firsthand from city officials about how an advance notification program can work. State lawmakers are exploring ways to provide Californians with greater notice of potential blackouts including scheduling them in advance. ??In Chicago where aging lines and structural limitations have produced a string of power outages over the past two summers residents often receive 30 minutes warning a blackout is coming and grid operators work with city agencies and police to ensure criminals don't take advantage of the opportunity. ??California's new warning system has considerable limits. ??The ISO after all does not determine where blackouts occur. They simply tell the three utilities in the system _ Pacific Gas & Electric Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric _ when to shut off power and how much to turn off. ??It is up to the utilities to determine where the blackouts occur. ??PG&E's website posts which of 14 outage blocks is next to be hit so anyone who knows their block number could use information from PG&E and the ISO websites to prepare for a blackout. ??PG&E spokesman John Nelson said the Northern California utility can make tens of thousands of phone calls to businesses and customers who need power for life-support systems and other medical necessities in a very short period of time. ??We think that anything that increases the amount of time that we're given by the ISO . . . is a good thing Nelson said adding that at the beginning of this year the utility was assuming that it would get about 30 minutes notice before blackouts were ordered. ??In another development on Monday state Controller Kathleen Connell issued another warning about the financial toll California's energy crisis is taking on the state treasury. Connell said the state could run out of cash by Sept. 1 if $ 13.4 billion in revenue bonds aren't sold. ??The state plans to sell the bonds in late August to cover the cost of buying electricity needed by financially troubled Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison to serve their customers. ??Even if the bonds go through without a hitch Connell said the state will have to seek more bonds or borrow between $3 billion and $5 billion beginning February 2002 to continue buying power. She said electricity purchases are costing the state more than the governor anticipated and far less has been bought through long-term contracts than Davis planned. ??But the governor's top energy aides challenged Connell's analysis and said they believe long-term contracts now being put in place combined with conservation efforts will bring spending down. Joe Fichera a Davis financial adviser said the state spent $1.8 billion to buy power in April only 1.4 percent higher than the $1.78 billion estimated. ??I think reasonable people can differ in terms of the projections Fichera said. I don't know what's underlying all of her assumptions and such. We do have more complete information . . . . ??To highlight the exorbitant costs of power Connell pointed to an enlarged picture of a $533 million check the state sent the Mirant Corp. for April power purchases. ??Mirant defended its sales. Included in its April sales were $126 million worth of electricity that the company bought from companies unwilling to sell to California but which Mirant purchased and then sold to California at a 12 percent markup according to figures released by the company. ??If the intent was to somehow attack Mirant for its role in the California market in April then I'd have to say that the state has apparently decided to bite a helping hand said Randy Harrison CEO of Mirant's western U.S. operations. ??KRT CALIFORNIA is a premium service of Knight Ridder/Tribune ??(c) 2001 Contra Costa Times (Walnut Creek Calif.). ??Visit the Contra Costa Times on the Web at http://www.cctimes.com/ JOURNAL-CODE: CC LOAD-DATE: May 22 2001 of 85 DOCUMENTS 2001 Copley News Service News Service 22 2001 Tuesday SECTION: State and regional LENGTH: 1066 words HEADLINE: State sends $533.2 million to company part of April bill BYLINE: Ed Mendel DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??One of the biggest single checks ever issued by the state of California $533.2 million went to an Atlanta-based firm Friday for power purchased for California utility customers during a single month April. ??Mirant formerly Southern Energy says more than half of the power came from three plants in the San Francisco Bay Area that it purchased from Pacific Gas and Electric for $801 million under a failed deregulation plan. ??State Treasurer Kathleen Connell who displayed a blown-up copy of the check at a news conference yesterday said she thinks the state has failed to obtain enough cheap long-term power contracts and will have to borrow more than the $13.4 billion planned. ??Connell an elected official who issues state checks said the power bills she had paid by last Thursday totaling $5.1 billion provide no basis for assuming that the price of electricity ''is dropping and that it will continue to drop through the summer.'' ??But a consultant for Gov. Gray Davis said the state which has more long-term contracts than Connell has seen is on track to control power costs with the aid of conservation and that it plans to meet its goals without additional borrowing. ??''I think the public should have confidence that this is not a rosy scenario'' said Joseph Fichera of Saber Partners a Davis consultant. ''It's the expected scenario.'' ??The state plans to issue a bond of up to $13.4 billion in late August that will repay the general-fund taxpayer money used for power purchases about $7 billion so far. The bond will be paid off over 15 years by utility customers. ??Davis has declined to reveal details of state spending for power arguing that the information would be used by power suppliers to submit higher bids. A group of newspapers and Republican legislators have filed lawsuits to force disclosure. ??Connell said she has received 25 contracts from 17 power suppliers. She declined to release details of the contracts saying they are complicated and have varying prices. ??Connell said the check for $533181235 issued to Mirant Friday is one of the largest she has written since taking office in 1995. ??''This purchase was made entirely at spot-market prices'' Connell said ''even though the Department of Water Resources (the state agency that purchases power) has an executed long-term contract with this company.'' ??Mirant said in a statement that at the request of the state its marketing arm gave the state a ''helping hand'' by buying power from suppliers not willing to sell to the state and then reselling the power to the state. ??''We've done the state a tremendous service in purchasing power on its behalf'' said Randy Harrison Mirant's Western chief executive officer ''and it's wrong for the transactions to be misinterpreted and skewed in a negative light.'' ??Mirant said its subsidiaries generated 1.377 million megawatt-hours in April while its marketing arm purchased enough additional electricity to boost the total sold to the state during the month to 2.077 million megawatt-hours. ??The firm said the power was sold for an average of $256.87 per megawatt-hour. That's below the $346 average that the state expects to pay on the expensive spot market during the second quarter of this year from April through June. ??But it's well above the average price of $69 per megawatt-hour said to have been obtained in the first round of long-term contracts negotiated by the state. ??Mirant purchased three power plants from PG&E capable of producing 3000 megawatts during a controversial part of deregulation. The state Public Utilities Commission ordered utilities to sell off at least half of their fossil-fuel power plants without requiring the purchasers to provide low-cost power to California. ??The utilities sold nearly two dozen major power plants capable of producing more than 20000 megawatts. The largest group of plants 4700 megawatts went to AES Corp. of Virginia. Three Texas firms purchased plants producing 7000 megawatts. ??The power supply situation in California remained sound enough yesterday to ward off blackouts although temperatures are on the rise throughout the state. More heat means more air conditioning and a greater strain on the system. ??But starting next month the state's electricity grid managers plan to provide businesses and consumers with better forecasts of potential rolling blackouts. ??The California Independent System Operator will post on its Web site ''power warnings'' when there is at least a 50 percent chance that rolling blackouts might be required during the next 24 hours. The ISO will issue a ''power watch'' when less-critical shortages are anticipated in advance of high demand days. ??The agency also plans to give a 30-minute warning before it orders utilities to cut power to customers posting information about probable interruptions on its Web site. Its Web site address is www.caiso.com. ??''There have been a number of requests from businesses and consumers alike that would like more advance notice and to be able to plan better. That's what we are trying to do'' ISO spokeswoman Lorie O'Donley said. ??O'Donley said many details about how notifications will occur still have to be worked out including whether e-mails or pagers might be used. ??In other developments in the electricity crisis: ???About 1.5 million compact fluorescent light bulbs will be distributed to 375000 households as part of the ''Power Walk'' program that began during the weekend. Members of the California Conservation Corps are going door-to-door in parts of some cities to distribute the bulbs as part of a $20 million conservation program. ???Republican legislative leaders sent Davis a letter criticizing the governor for using taxpayer funds to hire two aides to former Vice President Al Gore as communication consultants for $30000 a month. The Republicans said Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane operate ''a partisan cut-throat political communications firm.'' ???The state auditor general said in a report on energy deregulation that the state is not meeting some of its goals for conservation and for building new power plants. The auditor also said the PUC does not have a process for quickly approving new transmission lines. The state has been importing about 20 percent of its power.

Rose DATELINE: SAN DIEGO BODY: ??San Dieg Gas and Electric's commercial customers are attacking the prospect of paying an average of 29 percent more to cover the state's soaring cost of buying electricity. ??At a California Public Utilities Commission hearing in San Diego yesterday some business customers also noted the irony that only in February did they win the same rate freeze as residential customers. ??''We need rates we can depend on'' said John Roberts who owns an irrigation products business in San Marcos. ??SDG&E customers were the first to bear the brunt of deregulation and the utility's residential ratepayers were the first to win a reprieve when the state passed a 6.5-cent per kilowatt hour cap. ??The SDG&E cap is expected to end for all customers in the coming weeks as the commission moves to increase SDG&E's rates to levels now paid by customers of PG&E and Edison which are about 3 cents per kilowatt hour higher. ??Yesterday's hearing however was for commercial rates. ??Roberts said his San Marcos-based irrigation products company has withstood a tripling of power costs over the past year while having to cut the cost of its products because of competition he said. ??Roberts added that socking businesses with high costs in order to spare residential electricity customers from expected rate hikes could be counterproductive. ??''If businesses leave the state they'll be without jobs and a $30 savings on their power bills won't mean much'' Roberts said. ??The hearing at the County Administration Building was attended by about 30 people. An additional hearing is scheduled at 7 p.m. today in the Community Rooms at the Oceanside Civic Center 330 N. Coast Highway. ??Larger crowds are expected for hearings on residential rate increases.

BYLINE: DAN MORAIN TIMES STAFF WRITER DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Republican legislative leaders Monday blasted Gov. Gray Davis' decision to spend $30000 a month in taxpayer money to retain communications consultants known for their highly partisan work. ??Labeling consultants Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane as cut-throat Senate GOP leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga and Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks said in a letter to Davis that the hiring undermines the assertions you have made both publicly and privately throughout this crisis. ??Davis announced Friday that he retained the duo and that the state will pay them a combined $30000 a month for at least the next six months. ??We're not going to support the hiring of political hacks on government payroll Brulte said in an interview. Lehane and Fabiani are very talented. The issue is which payroll is appropriate. . . . These are political opposition research attack dogs. If the governor wants them he ought to pay for them with his $30-million political war chest. ??Some consumer advocates also criticized the move citing the consultants' work on behalf of Southern California Edison. In their private consulting business Fabiani and Lehane are working to win over public and political support for Davis' $3.5-billion plan to rescue Edison from its financial difficulties. Legislation embodying aspects of the deal is pending in Sacramento. ??On Monday Brulte and Cox also complained about the consultants' dual role. ??California taxpayers should not be asked to finance political consultants or individuals who have a vested business interest with the state the letter said. ??Fabiani and Lehane had worked in the Clinton administration and in Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign where they gained a reputation as attack-oriented operatives. Lehane on Monday defended the governor's decision to use tax money to pay their fees saying government often hires outside experts and that he and Fabiani will serve as communications advisors to help the governor fight against these generators. ??The Republicans Lehane added ought to be spending time writing letters to George W. Bush to get him to stop the Texas generators from gouging California. . . . That is the real issue here. ??Davis meanwhile returned to California on Monday after a weekend of fund-raisers. He was in Texas on Saturday for a Dallas event that had been scheduled for April 11. It was postponed when Pacific Gas & Electric filed for bankruptcy protection. ??There is a very large fund-raising base for Democrats in Texas Davis' campaign strategist Garry South said of the state that is home to some of the generators that Davis has criticized. ??Davis traveled to Chicago for another fund-raiser Sunday then met Monday with city officials to discuss how Chicago deals with electrical blackouts. ??After blackouts crippled downtown Chicago in the summer of 1999 Mayor Richard M. Daley demanded that the city's electricity provider Commonwealth Edison give advance notice of power cuts. Customers now sometimes receive warnings two or three days in advance. ??Davis emerged from the meeting saying the utilities have got to tell us in advance when they're going to have a planned blackout. ??It was not however readily apparent how Chicago's solutions would translate to California because its electrical problems are vastly different. Rather than suffering a shortage of electricity throughout the grid like California Chicago has the more microcosmic ills of an aging system--an obsolete transformer going down for example leaving several city blocks in the dark until workers can fix it. ??* ??Times staff writer Eric Slater contributed to this story.

BYLINE: DAN MORAIN TIMES STAFF WRITER DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Legislative Democrats today will sue federal energy regulators charging that their inaction threatens elderly people in nursing homes children in day care centers law enforcement and its ability to fight crime and the state's drinking water supplies. ??Rather than focus on record wholesale energy costs the lawsuit takes a new tack homing in on the threat to health and safety posed by California's energy crisis and the blackouts likely this summer. ??A draft of the suit seeks to force the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to set just and reasonable wholesale power rates as a way of ending the crisis before blackouts occur. The action is being filed by veteran trial attorney Joe Cotchett on behalf of Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco) Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks) and the city of Oakland. ??A crisis of unprecedented dimensions is already taking shape in California the draft says. The public health safety and welfare of the state's 34 million residents is in jeopardy due to the tragic consequences of rolling blackouts and punitive prices. ??Suit Says Blackouts Pose Threats ??Until now most California officials including Gov. Gray Davis have been urging that the regulatory commission cap wholesale power prices as a way of limiting costs to the state which has spent more than $6 billion buying electricity since January. ??In the lawsuit Cotchett will be arguing that while higher bills will stretch the budgets of people on fixed incomes frail elderly people are left to wonder if their oxygen tanks drip IVs dialysis machines and electricity-powered therapeutic beds will respond when they are needed. ??Rolling blackouts represent more than just an annoyance for the men women and children with disabilities the suit says. They represent an imminent threat to life health and independence. ??Cotchett said the suit will be filed in the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco bypassing the federal trial court. Cotchett said the circuit court has direct jurisdiction over FERC. ??Joining Cotchett will be Clark Kelso a professor at McGeorge Law School in Sacramento who briefly was insurance commissioner last year after Chuck Quackenbush resigned. Kelso said he initially was skeptical that lawmakers had legal standing to sue. But after Cotchett spoke with him Kelso said he became convinced the suit had merit. ??Let's face it said Kelso a Republican this is the single most important issue that the state faces for the next six months. ??Watching the Water Supply ??The suit cites warnings from governmental agencies about the implications of blackouts including one the state Department of Health Services issued earlier this month to public water agencies statewide. The warning contains a sample notice that local water authorities should give to consumers. ??If the water looks cloudy or dirty the warning says you should not drink it. The warning suggests that if people are concerned about water quality they can boil it or add eight drops of household bleach to one gallon of water and let it sit for 30 minutes. ??Most water agencies have back-up generators. But the suit says that if an agency's water treatment facilities are hit by a power outage a two-hour blackout can result in two-day interruptions in providing safe drinking water because of time needed to bring equipment back online and flush potentially contaminated water from the system.

The plan also responds to growing political pressure for the public to be kept informed of the barrage of outages that is expected to darken the state this summer because of insufficient supplies of electricity. ??If Californians' electricity use pattern is similar to last year's Cal-ISO has projected the state could suffer 34 days of blackouts making increased notification crucial. ??With a shortage of hydroelectric power imports from the drought-stricken Pacific Northwest and no new power plants coming online until July the agency calculates that there will be a supply-demand gap in June of 3700 megawatts--enough power to supply 2.8 million homes. A national utility industry group painted a more dire scenario last week when it predicted that California will experience up to 260 hours of blackouts this summer. ??The weather report and traffic report are good analogies people know they are not 100% accurate but if [a blackout] really means a lot to them they will check in said Mike Florio of the Utility Reform Network who serves on the Cal-ISO board. ??Details remain sketchy and the programs may be altered when the board meets Thursday. But a Web page called Today's Outlook on the agency's Internet site http://www.caiso.com will be created to illustrate hour by hour how much electricity is available during a 24-hour period and whether there is a predicted surplus or shortfall. ??Media outreach will be expanded to provide news bulletins on electricity conditions a day in advance. They will not only include demand projections and the effects of weather but they also will define the level of emergency that is expected. ??A power watch will be sounded during stage 1 and stage 2 shortages and a more serious power warning if there is a 50-50 chance of a stage 3 which often results in blackouts. (Stage 1 emergencies occur when power reserves drop below 7% stage 2 5% and stage 3 1.5%.) ??Most important Cal-ISO is pledging to provide 30-minute notice of probable blackouts to people in the areas served by Pacific Gas & Electric Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric among others. In addition to giving the warnings on the Internet and through the mass media Cal-ISO will sound alarms to select e-mail addresses and pager numbers on blast lists or massive computer databases that it will assemble. ??The technology is there. This is a war California is in and we should be deploying high-tech solutions said Carl Guardino of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group the Cal-ISO board member who had been pushing hardest for better notification. Every time California goes black the economy sees red. ??Guardino said that businesses and public agencies are now receiving just two- to six-minute warnings before blackouts not nearly enough to react. ??A two-minute warning may be sufficient in a football game but it is insufficient to protect California businesses and the public he said. ??Though businesses and government agencies are expected to make the most of the warnings Florio said residents also will benefit. ??It will be more of a challenge to get the information to individual homeowners but if someone works at home and sets it up to get an e-mail notice they can take advantage he said. ??In other energy news Monday the woman in charge of paying California's power bills warned that a $13.4-billion bond issue to cover electricity purchases will be insufficient and that the state will have to borrow $4 billion more before it runs out of cash in February. ??Calling a news conference in the capital state Controller Kathleen Connell questioned the key assumptions underpinning Gov. Gray Davis' financial plan for overcoming the energy crisis. The plan assumes the $13.4 billion in bond sales will repay state coffers for electricity purchases and cover future power buys for the next two years. ??Connell's opinion is notable because as the state's chief check writer the independently elected Democrat is privy to information about the prices the state is paying for electricity bought on the spot market and through long-term contracts--data that Davis has largely kept secret. ??Davis' advisors and Department of Finance officials dispute Connell's warnings.

Long commutes. Mediocre schools. Housing costs. At the Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area the Valley's answer to Central Park such ordinary concerns about money time and resources stretched too thin for comfort tumbled out again and again during interviews with some two dozen people visiting this green oasis. ??Sprawling northwest from the tangled junction of the San Diego and Ventura freeways the recreation area is a pastoral patchwork of three golf courses bracketed by Woodley Avenue Park to the east and Lake Balboa to the west. It hardly looks like a battleground but the 2000-acre park straddles something of a political fault line in the mayoral contest. ??Both candidates in the June 5 runoff former state legislator Antonio Villaraigosa and City Atty. James K. Hahn have staked out the Valley as prime campaign turf packed with thousands of up-for-grabs voters whose affections might well tip the race. ??And the Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area is wedged between an electoral no man's land--a southern ribbon of the Valley where about 60% of voters shunned both men in the election's first round--and a central Valley region where Villaraigosa took first place in April beating Hahn by roughly a 2-to-1 margin. ??Between them the candidates are expected to spend more than $10 million by election day to get their messages out. But it's not clear whether these impassioned appeals are reaching their intended targets. ??Less than a month before the election many people here are preoccupied with concerns that have little to do with City Hall. And when they do voice interest in local matters some seem unable to connect these issues to a candidate. ??For instance several Valley voters interviewed in the park in early May said that knotted traffic on the San Diego Freeway was a major problem. But no one mentioned a plan Villaraigosa unveiled in March to buy hundreds of new buses and slash fares in a sweeping bid to cut vehicle traffic or a proposal from Hahn to add more carpool lanes on freeways. ??Which raises a fundamental challenge for would-be mayors: Sometimes there's just too much going on in everyday life to tune in to city politics. I know I ought to many people confess sheepishly but I just haven't gotten around to it yet. ??Take Randye Sandel 58 a blond and bespectacled oil painter from Valley Village. Sandel said she plans to vote for Hahn a known quantity in City Hall but a moment later admits that she might change her mind. The thing is Sandel adds she's been really busy setting up an art exhibition at a Santa Monica gallery and has yet to research her mayoral options. I've been totally immersed in my own life she said. ??Same goes for Harold Seay a muscular golfer heading back to his car after playing 18 holes. The 44-year-old music teacher from Encino said he's had his hands full for weeks rehearsing graduation recitals for a Brentwood private school. The news is the last thing I'm paying attention to he said. ??But both voters can easily rattle off their most pressing concerns. Sandel who used to teach art at Valley College said she is particularly worried about education. ??The last few semesters I taught I was horrified by the academic preparedness of the students. They were practically illiterate she said. They couldn't take notes from my lecture because they didn't understand the vocabulary. That bothers me a lot. Who's going to inherit this country? ??Seay who recently moved to Los Angeles from Miami said he is troubled by the air pollution and racial tension he has encountered here. Seay is African American and his wife is Italian he said and their 9-year-old daughter is stuck half-and-half caught in what Seay regards as a troubling black-white divide. That black-white thing really turns me off he said. I care about people getting along. ??As the mayoral race hurtles into its final weeks some of Hahn and Villaraigosa's most spirited skirmishes have erupted over crime and law enforcement issues. Each man is trying to burnish his own crime-fighting credentials while accusing his rival of neglecting public safety. ??The candidates have squabbled especially fiercely over compressed work schedules for police officers--the notion of squashing the police workweek into three 12-hour days or possibly four 10-hour days. The Police Protective League endorsed Hahn who supports the so-called 3-12 schedule favored by the union. Villaraigosa whom Hahn has often characterized as soft on crime seized upon the scheduling issue to retaliate arguing that the three-day week would jeopardize public safety. ??But interviews with people visiting the Valley's biggest park revealed that crime--which has declined significantly since Mayor Richard Riordan took office eight years ago--was not the main issue weighing on these voters' minds. That distinction belongs to something that has walloped wallets far and wide across this car-addled city: the soaring price of gasoline. ??As he cooled down after a six-mile run near Balboa Lake Ray Verdugo summed up the problem facing many gas-guzzlers as prices approached $2 a gallon: I made a big mistake and bought a big SUV lamented the retired Rocketdyne engineer from Winnetka. I'm on a fixed income and [gasoline prices] keep going up all the time. ??Big-city mayors to be sure wield minimal influence over gasoline pumps. Gas prices are swayed by market forces including the international cost of crude oil rising demand and limited refinery capacity. Nonetheless about a third of voters interviewed as they ambled around the Sepulveda Basin named gas prices as a top concern. Half as many said they were worried about crime. ??Some voters said they were troubled by California's electricity woes although Los Angeles residents have been spared shortages and blackouts because the city's municipal utility avoided deregulation. ??I think building more power plants would help said Julie Erickson 27 a figure-skating instructor from Reseda. ??And then there are the things that people aren't talking about. Nobody (at least nobody in an admittedly unscientific sample of voters culled over two days in the Sepulveda Basin) mentioned the Rampart police scandal or the recruiting problems crippling the Los Angeles Police Department. ??No one uttered so much as a peep about neighborhood councils that much-ballyhooed innovation of the new city charter. Even the Valley secession movement--which Villaraigosa has pointed to as the biggest challenge facing Los Angeles--hardly earned an honorable mention from this cross-section of Valleyites. Only one voter referred to secession at all saying that she favored it. ??Instead many people voiced personal gripes the kind of woes unlikely to vault to the center of the mayoral radar screen--but issues that nonetheless embody the high quality of life both candidates envision for Los Angeles. ??One man a sunburned golfer who lives in Van Nuys said he's dismayed that the city hasn't finished building a new golf clubhouse and restaurant at the Woodley Lakes Golf Course. Another frequent park visitor a retired housekeeper from Sherman Oaks complained about the windblown litter she sees as she walks her dog around Balboa Lake. ??But some problems vexing these voters seem frankly beyond the grasp of even the most poll-tested candidate. ??Sandel the oil painter got downright metaphysical after a good 15 minutes spent mulling the troubles facing Los Angeles and indeed the world. Technology she concluded was advancing so rapidly that it was crowding out humanity's intuitive spiritual side. ??I think there's an extraordinary sense of collective despair and psychological uncertainty smoldering just below the surface she said. I don't know what City Hall can do about that. GRAPHIC: PHOTO: Ray Verdugo a retired Rocketdyne engineer says I'm on a fixed income and [gas prices] keep going up all the time.

The agency also promised to give 30 minutes' warning before it orders utility companies to pull the plug on homes and businesses a move that could prevent traffic accidents stuck elevators and costly shutdowns at factories. ??Up to now the agency has refused to give more than a few minutes' warning saying it did not want to alarm people when there was still a chance that a last-minute purchase of power could stave off blackouts. The utility companies also have resisted giving warnings saying they did not want to tip off burglars and other criminals. ??People are asking for additional notice so we're doing our best to make that a reality said Lorie O'Donley a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator. ??The state's power system crippled by a botched effort at deregulation has been unable to produce or buy enough electricity to power air conditioners on hot days. The rolling blackouts move from neighborhood to neighborhood in a sequence that is determined by the utility companies and is difficult for the public to predict. The outages last 60 to 90 minutes and then skip to another neighborhood. ??Because of the lack of notice the six days of rolling blackouts so far this year have led to pileups at intersections suddenly left without stoplights people trapped in elevators and losses caused by stopped production lines. People with home medical equipment fret that they will be cut off without warning. ??The new plan borrows from the language of weather forecasters: Beginning May 30 the ISO will issue a power watch or power warning that will give notice the grid could be headed toward blackouts. It will issue a 30-minute warning to the media and others before any blackouts begin but will not say what neighborhoods will be hit. ??Any time is better than none said Bill Dombrowski president of the California Retailers Association. Obviously we'd like more but we're realistic about what they can do.

A13 LENGTH: 669 words HEADLINE: Power plant 'ramping' to be probed State senators also expected to file suit charging federal regulators with failing to ensure fair rates SOURCE: Chronicle Staff Writer BYLINE: Christian Berthelsen BODY: State legislators said yesterday that they will investigate charges power companies manipulated electricity prices by repeatedly ramping the output of their plants up and down and creating artificial shortages. ???Sen. Joe Dunn D-Santa Ana (Orange County) who heads a special committee reviewing energy prices called the ramping allegations first disclosed in The Chronicle on Sunday outrageous acts of manipulation. ???Dunn said that even if the practices did not violate current law legislation could be drafted to make such acts illegal in the future. ???We're looking at it yes from the point of view of civil or criminal statutes that may exist but also whether legislation should be introduced to render it a violation for future such acts. ???Dunn's committee already has been investigating charges that power generators gamed the wholesale energy market to boost their profits. ???The Chronicle reported Sunday that power companies used a complex tactic to alter the output of their plants sometimes several times within an hour. ???Sources who work in the plants said the ploy enabled the companies to drive up the prices they receive for electricity. The firms avoided detection by still meeting the terms of their contracts which required them to supply a certain amount of power each hour. The sources said the tactic greatly contributed to deteriorating physical conditions at the plants leading to the record level of outages now plaguing California plants. ???The senate committee which convened in March after The Chronicle reported that power companies had overstated the growth in demand for electricity in California has obtained confidential bidding and generation data for power-generating companies. Dunn said the data will be analyzed to determine which plants employed the ramping tactic. He added that the issue would be examined in a public hearing in the coming weeks. ???Meanwhile pressure continued to mount on generating companies that drove electricity supplies through the roof during the past year. ???Sources said the California Public Utilities Commission which is investigating allegedly unnecessary plant shutdowns has narrowed its focus. It is targeting several plants that had no apparent defects yet went offline during periods when prices were rising because of limited electricity supplies. ???Commissioner Jeff Brown said the names of these plants are under court seal. However Dow Jones reported yesterday that one of them was a San Diego-area plant co-owned by Dynegy Inc. of Houston and NRG Inc. of Minneapolis. Another was a Pittsburg plant owned by Mirant Corp. of Atlanta. The companies denied the allegations. ???On another front Sen. John Burton D-San Francisco and Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg D-Sherman Oaks (Los Angeles County) were expected to file a lawsuit this morning against the Federal Energy Regulatory Committee for failing to carry out its stated duty of ensuring just and reasonable electricity rates. ???Their central failing is that they don't follow the law Burton said in an interview.

A1 LENGTH: 1527 words HEADLINE: Half-hour notice of blackouts planned FAST ALERTS: Power grid operator may send voice e-mail messages SOURCE: Chronicle Sacramento Bureau BYLINE: Lynda Gledhill DATELINE: Sacramento BODY: Californians will receive 30 minutes' warning that blackouts may be imposed -- enough time it is hoped to get out of the elevator or through a dangerous intersection the state's power grid managers said yesterday. ???The California Independent System Operator also will provide a daily power forecast 24 hours in advance so residents and businesses can plan for blackouts the same way people prepare for severe storms. ???We want a system that is proactive said Carl Guardino an ISO board member and president of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group. When the last few rolling blackouts hit there was as little as two minutes' warning. Two minutes may be fine in a football game but it's not fine for California's economy or safety. ???ISO officials also said they are examining high-tech ways of quickly spreading the word about impending blackouts to homeowners and businesses through mass e-mails faxes automated phone calls and pager messages. ???The plan detailed in a report issued yesterday still falls far short of other proposals being pushed in the Legislature. Lawmakers have suggested scheduling blackout days months in advance and having California join with other Western states to form a buyer's cartel that would refuse to pay for power when prices become too high. ???It's not the report I was expecting but 30 minutes of notice is certainly better than two said Sen. Debra Bowen D-Marina del Ray. No matter how you slice it this summer is going to be miserable. The question is whether we want to have planned misery or unplanned misery. ???A spokesman for the California Manufacturers and Technology Association which commissioned a recent report that found unplanned blackouts could cost the state economy $21.8 billion said the ISO policy changes will be a tremendous help to many businesses. ???In this electrically unreliable world any notification manufacturers can get is good said Gino DeCaro a spokesman for the association. While 30 minutes won't be enough for some for most manufacturers it will be sufficient. The ISO will wait for guidance from the governor and lawmakers regarding more complicated issues such as the creation of scheduled blackouts said Michael Florio an ISO board member and official at The Utility Reform Network. ???There are bigger public policy ramifications Florio said. ???The ideas will be discussed in greater detail at an ISO board meeting Thursday. Stephanie McCorkle an ISO spokeswoman said the changes are just updates of policies already in place. ???WARNING OF 'PROBABLE' BLACKOUTS ???The 30-minute advance-notification system scheduled to go into effect early next month would warn of probable blackouts including the amount of load that will have to be curtailed in each service area. ???Until now the agency has refused to give more than a few minutes' warning saying it did not want to alarm people when there was still a chance that a last-minute purchase of power could stave off blackouts. The utilities also have resisted giving warnings saying they did not want to tip off burglars and other criminals. ???The ISO also has been working to upgrade its Web site to provide the most current information about how much electricity is being used and how much is available. It will also establish a system this summer through which that information can be sent in an hourly e-mail. ???This information may make it easier for larger users of electricity to plan their operations said ISO spokeswoman Lorie O'Donley. ???Also planned by the ISO is a Power Watch/Power Warning system that would provide a 24-hour notice of high-demand days. ???Under the two-tiered system a Power Watch would be declared whenever a Stage One or Stage Two alert is likely while a Power Warning would be issued whenever there is at least a 50 percent chance of a Stage Three alert. ???With one report suggesting California may see as many as 700 hours of rolling blackouts this summer lawmakers are hard at work trying to find ways to make the outages easier for power customers to cope with. ???The idea of a buyer's cartel the subject of a Capitol hearing today would have California -- in partnership with other states -- set a firm ceiling on what it will pay power producers for electricity this summer -- and not one dime more. ???The idea which has attracted the support of some key lawmakers and the cautious interest of Gov. Gray Davis could potentially curtail the exorbitantly high prices the state has been paying for electricity. ???The trade-off would be the likelihood of more frequent blackouts than if the state continues to pay any price electricity sellers demand. ???The maximum the state would pay would be set by a formula based on such things as the cost of natural gas. A reasonable profit for power producers would be built in supporters said. ???DESIGNATING BLACKOUT DAYS ???Meanwhile Assemblyman Mike Briggs R-Fresno will introduce a bill today that would require the state's utilities and Public Utilities Commission to designate days for potential blackouts to each block. ???For example a customer located in Block 3 of Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s service area could be told in advance that power will be turned off June 5 if blackouts are needed that day. ???Right now every day is a potential blackout day Briggs said. This way people would know when their potential days are. ??On alert ???-- When demand is high the ISO will forecast peak demand power supply and weather 24 hours in advance. ???-- A power watch will be issued when it is likely the grid will reach Stage 1 (system is within 7% of running out of power) or Stage 2 (system is within 5% of running out of power). ???-- A power warning will be issued when there is at least a 50% chance of a Stage 3 alert (demand is within 1.5% of supply). ???Who calls a blackout? ???Engineers in Folsom at the Independent System Operator keep watch on the state's power consumption. When they determine that energy reserves have dipped below 1.5 percent of available capacity the ISO can order utilities to start cutting juice. Officials said this week they would give 30 minutes' notice before blackouts begin. The ISO tells the utilities exactly how much power to cut. ???Q: Who decides who gets blacked out and for how long? ???A: That's up to the utilities. PG&E has divided its 4.5 million customers into 14 blocks each block is darkened for one to two hours at a time. The blocks are defined by PG&E's network of circuits rather than by geography. Thus neighborhoods in San Francisco Oakland and Pleasant Hill can be blacked out simultaneously. ???Q: How many users are blacked out at once? ???A: Each of PG&E's 14 ???blocks represents about 550 megawatts of electricity. (A megawatt is enough electricity to power 1000 homes.) If PG&E is told to cut more than 550 megawatts it can shut down two or more blocks at a time. PG&E also can black out smaller portions within each block if the ISO's requirements are for less than 550 megawatts. ???Q: How is power shut off? ???A: This is a straightforward matter of shutting off circuits in a power substation by computer or sending a crew to flip the switches by hand. ???Q: How many days of blackouts have we had this year and how many customers have been affected? ???A: A total of 3035000 customers have been blacked out in the six days of rolling blackouts since Jan. 1 2001. ???Q: Which block of customers will be blacked out next? ???A: Some or all customers in Block 1. ???Q: How do I know what block I'm in? ???A: Look for the words Rotating Outage Block followed by a number on your bill. If it says Block 50 you share an electrical circuit with a hospital police station or other essential service that is normally exempt from service cuts. ???Q: What should I do when the lights go out? ???A: Power experts advise: ???-- Turn off all lights and appliances to prevent damage-causing power surges when service is restored. Leave one light on to indicate when the electricity is back. ???-- Use caution when driving because traffic signals may be out. Treat all intersections as a four-way stop. ???-- To protect food open refrigerator and freezer doors only when absolutely necessary. ???-- Keep a flashlight and radio with fresh batteries available. If you light candles observe the usual safety precautions. ???-- If the lights go out check with neighbors to determine if only your home is affected. It may be a downed power line or some other problem in which case you should alert PG&E or your city electrical bureau. ???-- When the power returns turn on one appliance at a time to prevent power surges. ???-- Don't plug a generator into the wall when the lights return it can send a high-voltage current through the system that can electrocute power workers. ???-- Tell children who are home alone to remain calm to turn off the TV and computers and not to use candles. ???Sources: PG&E Chronicle staff ???Chronicle Graphic ??E-mail Lynda Gledhill at lgledhill@sfchronicle.com.

And he's got to stop looking so cozy with business. ??The president's proposal emphasizes stepped-up production and modest conservation measures. It received mixed reviews from an anxious public that appears to want quick relief but sees the plan only helping after several years. ??Although Bush says his program will allow Americans to retain the lifestyle they are accustomed to only 30% of those surveyed said they believe it. Two of three said major lifestyle changes will be necessary to solve the nation's energy woes. ??Nearly half said the Bush plan would not do enough to conserve energy and 43% said the plan would do too little to increase production. ??Americans also were split over the Bush proposal to increase the number of nuclear power plants to generate electricity: 49% for and 46% against. ??The tepid response to the Bush energy plan might have been a factor in raising his job-disapproval rating from 31% a week ago to 36% now the highest of his presidency. His 56% job-approval rating did not change from a week ago. ??Bush's strongest disapproval came from Democrats low-income earners women under 50 and residents of California a state wrestling with electricity shortages. ??California Democratic Gov. Gray Davis was highly critical of the Bush plan. He said it does nothing to address the astronomical run-up in the prices of electricity natural gas and gasoline (and) favors more energy production at the expense of everything else. ??White House spokesman Claire Buchan said the president will continue to press his plan regardless of the polls: The president does not govern by polls. This is a serious issue that has been neglected for years and he has begun a serious dialogue with the American people. It will continue. ??Most poll respondents said they see threats of electricity shortages and the rising price of gasoline and heating fuels as serious problems although only 12% said they see a state of crisis. And most of those polled said Bush is not doing enough to address those problems. ??At the same time most said energy companies have too much influence over the administration's energy polices an argument Democrats raise. ??One in five said the Bush administration deserves a great deal of blame for the energy problems 28% put a great deal of that blame on the Clinton administration.

Maybe that is the reason for his optimism: the north and the south Alaska to Patagonia extend farther suggest a future wider than the American future bounded by coastlines. ??Along with his far northern ambition for the Alaskan wilderness Mr. Bush has broached with the Mexican president Vicente Fox the possibility of building power plants in Mexico for American consumers north of the border. Such schemes reveal him to be perhaps a visionary as much as he seems a man oblivious of the lessons John Muir discovered in California. ??Which is only to say there is a wisdom in the way the Texan sees our American future. ?There is also a wisdom to the way Californians understand that future. ??FRANK LEADS CHARGE ??A group of 22 House Democrats yesterday sent a letter to all U.S. senators urging them to delay the confirmation of solicitor general candidate Theodore Olson until he gives a full and honest accounting of his role in a magazine's investigations of former President Bill Clinton. ??As members of various House committees with jurisdiction over the investigations that resulted from accusations of wrongdoing against President Clinton we became very familiar with the quality of these accusations they wrote. ?To our disappointment we found that there was a consistent pattern . . . of ideological opponents of the president making irresponsible unfounded and often scurrilous charges. ??Led by Rep. ?Barney Frank Massachusetts Democrat the group is asking senators to defeat Mr. ?Olson's nomination if it turns out that he was deeply involved in this disinformation campaign. ??Mr. ?Olson has told the Senate Judiciary Committee that as a member of the American Spectator's board of directors he learned of the magazine's so-called Arkansas Project in mid-1997. He has said he did not take an active role in the investigative project. ??The panel voted 9-9 on party lines last week on Mr. ?Olson's nomination and Senate Democrats are demanding more documents and information about his involvement with the magazine before a floor vote on the nomination. ??BUSH COURTS RIORDAN ??Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan a Republican serving his final days in that office may run for governor against incumbent Democrat Gray Davis in 2002 National Journal reports. ??You can say I'm giving it serious thought Mr. ?Riordan said in an interview with the magazine. ??Previously the 71-year-old Mr. ?Riordan had expressed support for Los Angeles investment banker William E. ?Simon Jr. who has been readying his candidacy for the Republican nomination. ?But that was before a May 1 phone call from President Bush in which the president wished the mayor a happy birthday - and urged him to think about the governorship. ??I think he sees this as a chance to revive the party and the president was extremely encouraging and very persuasive Mr. ?Riordan said. ?As you know the Republican Party in California has been an endangered species now for several years. ??BUSH BETTERS DAVIS ??California Gov. ?Gray Davis blames President Bush for his state's electricity woes but a new survey finds that Californians have a higher opinion of the president than of their governor. ??Only 46 percent of 2001 respondents in a poll conducted by the Public Policy Institute of California gave Mr. ?Davis a positive job-approval rating down from 63 percent in January. ?And only 29 percent of those polled approved of the way the Democrat is handling the electricity crisis. Sixty percent disapprove. ??Mr. ?Bush on the other hand had a 57 percent job-approval rating with 36 percent disapproving. ?Thirty-three percent approved of his handling of the electricity problem while 56 percent disapproved. ??HIS BETTER HALF ??June's Talk magazine recalls the relationship of President Johnson and his wife Lady Bird who was keenly aware that a President might seek out the companionship of other women according to Kati Marton's new book Hidden Power: Presidential Marriages That Shaped Our Recent History. ??If I wanted him to do without the stimulation knowledge or assistance that other women offered him it would after a period have diminished me said Mrs. ?Johnson who had a unique understanding of what she called the 'help and support' of other women according to the book. ??Mrs. ?Johnson managed to keep an eye on LBJ's extramarital liaisons and even learned a thing or two from his mistresses. ?I learned how to dress better from this one to always wear lipstick from another about art or music from another she said. ??It was well-known around the White House that Mr. ?Johnson was a womanizer but such things were kept hidden by the media in those halcyon days. ??Suddenly the President appeared and pulled up a chair recalled one veteran reporter in the book. ?'Now boys let me tell you something.

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Californians will soon be waking up to the weather the traffic and a blackout forecast. ??The operator of the state's electricity grid said Monday that it will start issuing forecasts 24 hours ahead of expected rolling blackouts. ??The agency also promised to give 30 minutes' warning before it orders utilities to pull the plug on homes and businesses a move that could prevent traffic accidents stuck elevators and costly shutdowns at factories. ??Up to now the agency has refused to give more than a few minutes' warning saying it did not want to alarm people when there was still a chance that a last-minute purchase of power could stave off blackouts. The utilities have also resisted giving warnings saying they did not want to tip off criminals. ??People are asking for additional notice so we're doing our best to make that a reality said Lorie O'Donley a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator. ??Californians have been warned that rolling blackouts could be a regular feature this summer. The state's power system crippled by a botched effort at deregulation has been unable to produce or buy enough electricity to power air conditioners on hot days. ??The rolling blackouts move from neighborhood to neighborhood in a sequence that is determined by the utilities and is difficult or impossible for the public to predict. The outages last 60 to 90 minutes and then skip to another neighborhood. ??Because of the lack of notice the six days of rolling blackouts to hit the state so far this year have led to pileups at intersections suddenly left without stoplights people trapped in elevators and losses caused by stopped production lines. People with home medical equipment like oxygen fret they that they will be cut off without warning. ??The new plan by the ISO borrows from the language of weather forecasters: Beginning May 30 it will issue a power watch or power warning that will give notice the grid could be headed toward blackouts. ??The ISO will issue 30-minute warnings to the media and others before any blackouts begin. However the ISO will not say what neighborhoods will be hit. ??Any time is better than none said Bill Dombrowski president of the California Retailers Association. Obviously we'd like more but we're realistic about what they can do. ??The plan falls far short of what some consumer groups and legislators are demanding. ??State Sen. Debra Bowen has said she envisions giving consumers three to five days' notice that their power will be cut during a particular period so businesses could shut down or shift their operations to non-peak hours such as nights and weekends.

The plant owned by local power wholesaler Pinnacle West Energy will produce enough electricity to serve about 120000 homes though much of it may be sold elsewhere. ??On Monday PG&E National Energy Group a sister of California's financially squeezed PG&E Gas and Electric broke ground for its planned $500 million generating plant west of Phoenix that will use natural gas. ??It's one of up to 11 plants planned for Arizona by out-of-state interests. Three such plants are expected to begin production this summer though much of their power also may be sold to other states. ??That's true of the PG&E National plant too but those who live in the vicinity don't care. ??We have nothing out here now said Elisa Bigbey of Harquahala Valley. We want to get something going. ??The plant will increase the assessed valuation of the area by 17 times and will generate $10.7 million in new property taxes. PG&E already has given the local school district a portable shed in which to store records because the district's only school was damaged by a November fire. ??PG&E also is making a no-strings outright gift to the community of $550000 in 11 annual cash installments. A committee of local residents will decide how to spend the windfall. ??Meanwhile Panda Energy of Dallas and Teco Power Services of Tampa Fla. recently broke ground for a plant south of the PG&E site and Duke Energy North America of Charlotte N.C. and Sempra Energy of San Diego each have started plants in the Arlington Valley. ??Pinnacle West Generating has a plant under construction near the Palo Verde nuclear plant in this same general area. ??Additionally the Desert Basin Plant in Casa Grande is owned by Reliant Energy of Houston. The Griffith Energy Plant near Kingman is owned by Duke Energy and P&L Global. The Southpoint plant set to begin production next month near Bullhead City is owned by Calpine Corp. of San Jose. ??Such plants have come to Arizona because there's lot of space in Arizona water is relatively inexpensive there's access to natural gas regulators are friendly and the plants can be situated at a distance from urban air pollution controls. ??The PG&E plant will produce nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxides that can lead to formation of ozone an air pollution problem against Phoenix has been fighting for years. ??Additionally the plant will use 6500 acre feet of water a year enough to meet the needs of a town of about 30000. PG&E expects to use surplus Central Arizona Project water from the distant Colorado River - but the Harquahala Valley has a good supply of underground water PG&E can tap if the CAP surplus disappears.

The Independent System Operator will also be issuing a daily energy forecast with projected supply and demand and the likelihood of blackouts. Several lawmakers say they'll introduce plans that would give Californians even more notice of blackouts - from one day to one month. ??- The state auditor releases a report on the state's energy crisis saying previous estimates that the state could avoid blackouts this summer are overly optimistic. The Bureau of State Audits also criticized the California Public Utilities Commission saying the commission hasn't responded to the crisis by expediting transmission line project. ??- Gov. Gray Davis is in Chicago speaking with city officials there about blackout procedures. ??- Davis' energy advisers say that the state is meeting its energy goals despite doubts raised by Controller Kathleen Connell and other critics. Connell questioned whether the state can buy enough electricity cheap enough to avoid borrowing more than the $13.4 billion approved by state lawmakers. But Davis adviser Joe Fichera says the state has signed more long-term power contracts that will help keep prices low. ??- Davis' office announces that an eighth peaker power plant has been licensed. The 135-megawatt plant in Gilroy is expected to be online by the end of September. The California Energy Commission says that more than 10000 megawatts of new electricity since April 1999. ??- The California Energy Commission also announces increased rebates for renewable energy systems - such as solar panels fuel cells or small wind generation. Rebates of up to 50 percent on the system are available for residential commercial industrial or agricultural users. ??- Republican legislative leaders criticize Davis for spending tax money on a political communications firm that previously advised Vice President Al Gore. Davis is hiring Gore's former press secretary and deputy campaign manager for six months at $30000 a month to coordinate the governor's communications on energy issues. Senate GOP Leader Jim Brulte and Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox say Davis should pay them with campaign funds not taxpayers' money. ??- Shares of Edison International closed at $11.23 down 51 cents. PG&E Corp. dropped 48 cents to close at $11.16. ??WHAT'S NEXT: ??- Davis' representatives continue negotiating with Sempra the parent company of San Diego Gas and Electric Co. to buy the utility's transmission lines. ??- Davis is scheduled to sign a bill Tuesday that would expedite power plant siting. ??- Republican Assemblyman Mike Briggs plans to introduce a bill that would allow people to know a month ahead if they will be affected by rolling blackouts. ??THE PROBLEM: ??High demand high wholesale energy costs transmission glitches and a tight supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in the Northwest and maintenance at aging California power plants are all factors in California's electricity crisis. ??Edison and PG&E say they've lost nearly $14 billion since June to high wholesale prices the state's electricity deregulation law bars them from passing on to consumers. PG&E saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state lawmakers filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. ??Electricity and natural gas suppliers scared off by the two companies' poor credit ratings are refusing to sell to them leading the state in January to start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and business customers. The state is also buying power for a third investor-owned utility San Diego Gas & Electric which is in better financial shape than much larger Edison and PG&E but also struggling with high wholesale power costs. ??The Public Utilities Commission has approved average rate increases of 36 percent for residential customers and 38 percent for commercial customers and hikes of up to 49 percent for industrial customers and 15 or 20 percent for agricultural customers to help finance the state's multibillion-dollar power buys.

It is at once a triumph of technology and Western gumption and a reminder of how tenuous it all is. ??The great growth in the West followed a simple recipe: Water plus power equals population. There was always a feeling that the land was so big you couldn't use it up not the resources not the space. ??Today there are signs that's no longer true. In California blackouts. In Oregon and Washington drought. In Arizona arsons to stop construction. And in every rearview mirror more traffic all the time. ??The allure of vast prairies open skies and endless opportunity is what first drew people out West. But as deserts disappear under development possibilities become problems. ??Now with its infrastructure strained by growth the West faces difficult choices: Energy or environment? Freeways or orchards? Water for people or fish? ??We're losing what we've come for this ideal says James Corless California director of the Surface Transportation Policy Project which aims to diversify transportation systems to reduce traffic and pollution caused by growth. And we are loath to change. ??--- ??When the streets went dark in California a light bulb came on across the West. ??The region saw its vulnerability. For one very important resource demand had won out over supply. What about all the others? ??We've got an infrastructure that can't really carry much additional power. We're starting to see the same situation with water says John Maddox president of the Denver-based Center for the New West. ??And people keep coming. ??The West added more than 10 million people in the 1990s making it the fastest-growing region in the United States. In the next decade another 10 million are expected. ??What does that mean? Maddox says. How many new roads new water infrastructure and treatment facilities how many new runways and airports? ??Perhaps more than clogged freeways and periodic droughts the power crisis has brought home the reality that there are limits to growth. ??In California electricity consumption rose 24 percent in the past five years as the economy grew by 29 percent. However no major new plants were built in the state in the past 10 years according to Cambridge Energy Research Associates. ??Several projects to generate new power were shelved in the 1990s because of regulatory red-tape environmental protests economics and wariness over the state's deregulation plan. ??As a result the power ran low and California was forced to go to the open market in search of electricity sending power rates soaring and shutting out the lights in rolling blackouts. ??California officials now predict it will take two to three years before energy production catches up with demand. ??Meanwhile the crisis has crossed state lines. In the Northwest generating capacity grew 4 percent in the 1990s while demand grew 24 percent. That wasn't a problem when abundant rain and snow produced above-average hydropower generation between 1995 and 2000. ??Then drought hit and generation dropped. Washington Oregon Idaho and Montana are about 3000 megawatts short of the electricity they need. ??Now everyone's playing catch-up. California is on a plant-building spree while other states are pushing conservation and looking for alternative fuel sources. ??Even in power-hungry Las Vegas the mega-resorts are cutting back. The MGM Grand refitted its 5000 guest rooms with low-watt fluorescent bulbs and changed its casino-floor lighting. Treasure Island's parking garage is switching to sodium bulbs that use 30 percent less energy. ??But a feeling of dread is gripping some Westerners. If the lights can go out what's next? Dry faucets? ??The thing I worry about is water says Carol Ann Heggie-Hall a retired science teacher who moved from Queens N.Y. to Henderson Nev. in 1999. Is there enough water for everyone and their plants? ??Much of the West is facing the worst drought in a quarter-century prompting warnings of environmental degradation forest fires and agricultural decline. Nevertheless experts say the West isn't in danger of running out of water. The challenge is determining who gets how much. ??It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that if the faucets ran dry in Scottsdale there are places to go to get water says Joe Hunter a power and water specialist at the Center for the New West. But it means shifting it from one use to another. ??About 80 percent of water in most Western states is used to irrigate crops a percentage that could drop if residential supplies were strained Hunter says. ??Western states and cities must also do more to share water. ??California has long used more than its allocation from the Colorado River which supplies drinking water to seven Western states. An agreement allows California to receive surplus water if it implements conservation measures that will reduce its reliance on the river in the future. ??In the meantime Western cities are looking elsewhere to sustain the supply. The Las Vegas Valley predicts it will reach its annual Colorado River allocation by 2007 so its regional water authority is negotiating to store 1.2 million acre feet of water in Arizona for the next 15 years. ??Beyond power and water other infrastructure problems persist. In the Vegas area which added 700000 people in the '90s road closures due to highway expansions are a daily occurrence. ??There are few roads you can drive on that aren't under construction admits Jim Gibson mayor of Henderson a city south of Vegas that is among the country's most rapidly growing communities. ??Without the new roads Vegas transportation officials estimate there would be 2289 miles of congestion by the year 2025 compared with 341 miles last year. ??Highways alleviate congestion but also drive more growth. ??Interstate 5 the north-south freeway through Washington and Oregon became a growth magnet. In Colorado Interstate 70 has opened the mountains to staggering growth west of Denver. ??-- ??In the fastest-growing metro area in the fastest-growing state in the fastest-growing region of the country Greg Cox and Dale Stark are unloading dirt on a Las Vegas street crammed with construction workers. ??The landscapers are a rare breed in a town teeming with newcomers: Cox has lived here all his life Stark moved from Southern California in 1979. ??Both grumble about the changes they've seen and both vow to leave. ??I moved here when this town was nice Stark says. Now you can't drive down the road without getting cut off and flipped off. ??Cox complains he can barely get around at all. A drive across town used to take 20 minutes. Now he grunts You've got to pack a lunch. ??Both agree: Even Las Vegas the city built on the very idea of unlimited resources and space is reaching its limits. ??The sentiment is spreading across the West: Unbridled growth must stop. ??Planning experts insist cities must reinvest in old neighborhoods rather than build new ones and provide incentive to plan for growth in a way that incorporates existing infrastructure. ??Portland Ore. has been a national leader with its urban growth boundary. In San Francisco a program provides federal money to developers who build homes near transit stops. ??Still when initiatives to rein in growth were placed on the ballot in several Western states last November most of the big measures failed - including one in Arizona to force developers to pay for new infrastructure. Opponents warned that growth controls would be bad for business. ??In Las Vegas despite infrastructure challenges the official line remains that growth is good. ??As long as you can take care of the social problems and quality of life problems there's never such a thing as too much growth declares Mayor Oscar Goodman.

BODY: ??Californians will soon be waking up to the weather the traffic - and a blackout forecast. ??The operator of the state's electricity grid said Monday it will start issuing forecasts 24 hours ahead of expected rolling blackouts. ??The agency also promised to give 30 minutes' warning before it orders utilities to pull the plug on homes and businesses a move that could prevent traffic accidents stuck elevators and costly shutdowns at factories. ??Up to now the agency has refused to give more than a few minutes' warning saying it did not want to alarm people when there was still a chance that a last-minute purchase of power could stave off blackouts. The utilities have also resisted giving warnings saying they did not want to tip off burglars and other criminals. ??People are asking for additional notice so we're doing our best to make that a reality said Lorie O'Donley a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator. ??Californians have been warned that rolling blackouts could be a regular feature this summer. The state's power system crippled by a botched effort at deregulation has been unable to produce or buy enough electricity to power air conditioners on hot days. ??The rolling blackouts move from neighborhood to neighborhood in a sequence that is determined by the utilities and is difficult or impossible for the public to predict. The outages last 60 to 90 minutes and then skip to another neighborhood. ??Because of the lack of notice the six days of rolling blackouts to hit the state so far this year have led to pileups at intersections suddenly left without stoplights people trapped in elevators and losses caused by stopped production lines. People with home medical equipment like oxygen fret they that they will be cut off without warning. ??The new plan by the ISO borrows from the language of weather forecasters: Beginning May 30 it will issue a power watch or power warning that will give notice the grid could be headed toward blackouts. ??The ISO will issue 30-minute warning to the media and others before any blackouts actually begin. However the ISO will not say what neighborhoods will be hit. ??Any time is better than none said Bill Dombrowski president of the California Retailers Association. Obviously we'd like more but we're realistic about what they can do. ??Assemblyman Fred Keeley the Legislature's point man on energy acknowledged that scheduling blackouts could attract criminals and open the state to legal liability for accidents at blacked-out intersections. ??That is a genuine problem and genuine concern Keeley said earlier. I think we would have to work with local governments so they could have a sufficient advance notice to be able to foresee that and try to deploy their resources appropriately. ??The ISO said it also is looking into high-tech ways it can get word of an impending blackout quickly to homeowners and businesses through mass e-mails faxes automated phone calls and pager messages. ??The plan falls far short of what some consumer groups and legislators are demanding. ??State Sen. Debra Bowen has said she envisions giving consumers three to five days' notice that their power will be cut during a particular period so businesses could shut down or shift their operations to non-peak hours such as nights and weekends. ??State Assemblyman Mike Briggs said he plans to introduce a bill that would have the Public Utilities Commission notify businesses and homeowners as much as one month ahead of time when they would have their power cut. ??We owe the people of this state some kind of schedule Briggs said. If businesses and individuals knew what days their power could potentially be shut off or blacked out they could plan for that blackout accordingly. ??On the Net: ??California Independent System Operator: http://www.caiso.com LOAD-DATE: May 22 2001 of 85 DOCUMENTS Associated Press The materials in the AP file were compiled by The Associated Press. ?These materials may not be republished without the express written consent of The Associated Press. ????????????????????????May 21 2001 Monday BC cycle SECTION: Domestic News LENGTH: 229 words HEADLINE: Survey: Gov. Davis' ratings public confidence take dive BYLINE: By ALEXA HAUSSLER Associated Press Writer DATELINE: SACRAMENTO Calif. BODY: ??Californians' confidence in Gov. Gray Davis and the economy has plunged in the face of a statewide energy crisis according to a poll released Monday. ??This crisis and general economic uncertainty have severely undermined public confidence in California's future and in its leaders said Mark Baldassare director of the survey by the Public Policy Institute of California. ??The institute a nonprofit organization that researches economic social and political issues interviewed 2001 adult California residents in English and Spanish between May 1 and May 9. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points. ??Forty-six percent said they approve of the way the Democratic governor is handling his job down from 66 percent in September. ??And for the first time since the mid-1990s more of the state's residents - 48 percent - believe that California is headed in the wrong direction. Forty-four percent believe it is on the right track. ??The poll also found that Californians blame the electric utility companies more than anyone else for the energy crunch. Thirty-two percent said they fault utilities while 26 percent blame former Gov. Pete Wilson and the Legislature 10 percent blame Davis and the current Legislature and 10 percent blame power generators. ??On the Net: ??Public Policy Institute of California: www.ppic.org LOAD-DATE: May 22 2001 of 85 DOCUMENTS ???????????????????The Associated Press State & Local Wire The materials in the AP file were compiled by The Associated Press. ?These materials may not be republished without the express written consent of The Associated Press. ????????????????????????May 21 2001 Monday BC cycle SECTION: State and Regional LENGTH: 720 words HEADLINE: Grid officials others studying planned blackouts BYLINE: By JENNIFER COLEMAN Associated Press Writer DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Could Californians be waking up to hear a weather report a pollen count and an electricity blackout forecast? ??It's not out of the question say some lawmakers. ??I actually think it's a thoughtful plan ... to give folks an opportunity to understand the likelihood of blackouts on a daily basis Assemblyman Fred Keeley D-Boulder Creek the Assembly's point man on energy. ??Keeley compared it to weather forecasting to be able to look at the next three or four days have a percentile about the likelihood of blackouts. ??The Independent System Operator keeper of the state's power grid is expected to release a report Monday detailing how such a plan would work. ??The idea is to provide a lot of information so people can make choices to live with blackouts on a temporary basis this summer Keeley said. ??Peter Navarro a University of California Irvine economics professor released a report last month with a consumer group that recommends the state set a price limit on what they'll pay for power. And if generators don't lower the price the state should schedule blackouts to cut consumption he said. ??The report by Navarro and the Utility Consumers' Action Network says the state's current method of highly disruptive random rolling blackouts needs to be revamped. ??UCAN suggests that the state be divided into blackout zones that utilities could notify ahead of time that power would be cut at a specific time and for a certain duration. ??Scheduling blackouts could attract criminals to outage areas Keeley acknowledged and possibly could subject the state to legal liability for traffic accidents or other incidents if power is deliberately shut off. ??That is a genuine problem and genuine concern Keeley said. I think we would have to work with local governments so they could have a sufficient advance notice to be able to foresee that and try to deploy their resources appropriately. ??Critics of the planned blackouts said power producers simply could sell their unused electricity to other states or trim back production to keep supplies short. ??Assemblyman Mike Briggs R-Fresno plans to introduce a bill this week that would have the Public Utilities Commission notify businesses and homeowners as much as one month ahead of time when they would have their power cut. ??We owe the people of this state some kind of schedule Briggs said. If businesses and individuals knew what days their power could potentially be shut off or blacked out they could plan for that blackout accordingly. ??The Central Valley Republican said the ability to plan for outages would be especially benefit farmers who need power to irrigate their crops. ??Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg who convened a special subcommittee on blackouts has also suggested the state should consider scheduling daily blackouts to cut the state's power use and drive down prices. Democratic Assembly members plan to introduce their own version of a blackout plan. ??Sen. Debra Bowen D-Marina del Rey has said she envisions giving consumers three to five days notice that their power will be cut during a particular period so businesses could opt to shut down or shift their operations to nonpeak hours such as nights and weekends. ??And by treating blackouts as a first option rather than a last resort the state could cut its peak power needs and drive down prices Bowen said. California power consumers would in essence form a reverse cartel to stop the market manipulation and the price gouging she said. ??The planned blackout suggestions come as state officials grow increasingly concerned that power prices will keep rising this summer even beyond the extraordinary levels the state already has been paying on behalf of three cash-strapped privately owned utilities. ??Gov. Gray Davis said the state paid $1900 per megawatt hour at one point last week. ??The state has dedicated $6.7 billion since mid-January to purchase power for Pacific Gas and Electric Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric. ??Those expenditures will be repaid this summer when the state issues $13.4 billion in revenue bonds. The bonds will be repaid by ratepayers over 15 years. ??--- ??On the Net: ??California Independent System Operator: http://www.caiso.com/ LOAD-DATE: May 22 2001 of 85 DOCUMENTS ???????????????????The Associated Press State & Local Wire The materials in the AP file were compiled by The Associated Press. ?These materials may not be republished without the express written consent of The Associated Press. ????????????????????????May 21 2001 Monday BC cycle SECTION: State and Regional LENGTH: 901 words HEADLINE: 'Baseline' becoming key word for electric customers BYLINE: By KAREN GAUDETTE Associated Press Writer DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO BODY: ??A little calculation on electric bills is fast becoming a big concern for millions of residential customers of California's two largest utilities. ??Sitting near the top of Southern California Edison electric bills and near the bottom of the last page of Pacific Gas and Electric bills is a number called baseline which guarantees a certain amount of electricity at the lowest price utilities charge. ??This number which differs from customer to customer based on a host of factors is the benchmark for determining how much more residents will pay for electricity come June - when the largest rate hikes in California history start showing up on bills. ??Now with deregulation and prices being so much higher it's going to require that people educate themselves about their bills the same way they had to do when long distance telephone service was deregulated said Commissioner Carl Wood of the Public Utilities Commission. ??Under a rate-hike allocation plan approved Tuesday by the PUC everyone who exceeds baseline by more than 30 percent will pay progressively more for that additional electricity - with the heaviest residential users facing a 37 percent average hike on their overall bill translating to an increase of roughly $85 a month. ??State law ensures that residential customers who don't use more than 30 percent above baseline will not face the rate hikes. The PUC figures around half of PG&E and Edison customers now fall into that category. ??But consumer rights groups and even the utilities think the PUC is underestimating residential electric use given the recent proliferation of home computers cell phone chargers and the like. ??They think baseline is set too low for many customers and say families and people who work at home will pay more than their fair share of the rate hikes. ??It's an anti-family action. People with kids have a hard time staying within baseline said Mike Florio senior attorney with The Utility Reform Network. A rate hike of 30 to 40 percent could be 100 percent for people with large households. ??Since 1982 when lawmakers created baseline - given in cents per kilowatt hour per month - to ensure a minimum amount of affordable power and encourage conservation the PUC has determined baseline by dividing the state into climatic and geographic regions. ??PG&E has 10 such regions within its service territory in northern and central California Edison has six in central and southern California. ??The PUC then finds the average amount of electricity use for customers within each region. The baseline quantity is 50 percent to 60 percent of that amount and up to 70 percent of that amount during the winter months if a customer uses only one type of energy (electricity or natural gas). ??Customers who depend on electronic medical equipment such as suction breathing and dialysis machines can apply for a slightly higher baseline. ??A family living in the scorching hot Coachella Valley would have a larger allotment of lower-priced electricity than a family living in breezy Monterey given that air conditioning for the former is necessary to survival. ??Since baseline is based on averages a single apartment dweller and a family of four who live in the same region could have the same baseline. That makes it more likely for the family to get hit with rate hikes and less likely economists fear that the apartment dweller has a financial incentive to conserve. ??Where it is imperfect is that it has no ability to make any adjustments for the size of the family said John Nelson a PG&E spokesman. ??Focusing baseline on household size gets complicated Florio said. Does PG&E come by and do bed checks? ??Along with raising $5.7 billion to replenish the state's general fund for power buys since January the rate hikes approved March 27 by the PUC and allocated on Tuesday were also meant to trigger conservation that could help avoid rolling blackouts this summer. ??Baseline has not been reassessed since the early 1990s. PUC president Loretta Lynch and fellow commissioner Wood say they may hold hearings as early as this coming week on possible inequities and ways to update the system. ??There was plenty of testimony at public hearings that people suspect that baselines are not appropriate or are not calculated right Wood said. ??Wood said when baseline first was created nearly 20 years ago houses were smaller and many lacked central air conditioning. ??Though the PUC has updated baseline amounts through the years living standards have changed housing standards have changed and it may be that average usage is different from what it was Wood said. ??Florio said giving baselines a second look could go either way for consumers. There are typically more electronic gadgets in homes these days but many of those gadgets and appliances are more energy efficient than their ancestors. ??Add that to increased conservation statewide Florio said and there's a slim chance baselines could actually go down and expose more customers to rate hikes. ??It's a percentage of average use historically and people have used energy more efficiently through the years Florio said. ??--- ??On the Net: ??California Public Utilities Commission: http://www.cpuc.ca.gov ??Pacific Gas and Electric Co.: http://www.pge.com ??Southern California Edison Co.: http://www.sce.com LOAD-DATE: May 22 2001 of 85 DOCUMENTS ???????????????????The Associated Press State & Local Wire The materials in the AP file were compiled by The Associated Press. ?These materials may not be republished without the express written consent of The Associated Press. ????????????????????????May 21 2001 Monday BC cycle SECTION: State and Regional LENGTH: 273 words HEADLINE: New poll suggests Californians haven't been this gloomy for years DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO BODY: ??Not since the mid-'90s have more Californians believed the state is headed in the wrong direction. ??And it may get worse. ?Nearly 60 percent of state residents expect the economy to worsen in the next year while about 40 percent see a brighter horizon according to a new poll. ??The telephone survey of 2001 adult Californians was done over eight days in early May by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California. The poll was conducted in English and Spanish. ??The twin culprits were the souring economy and the electricity crisis. ??Californians clearly see the electricity crisis as a harbinger of other growth-related problems said Mark Baldassare the research institute's survey director. This crisis and general economic uncertainty have severely undermined public confidence in California's future and in its leaders. ??Change has come swiftly. ??In January 62 percent of state residents said California was headed in the right direction compared to 48 percent this month. ??Other key findings include: ??-82 percent of respondents said population growth over the next 20 years will make California a less desirable place to live. ??-86 percent of respondents said the electricity crisis will hurt the state's economy. ??-43 percent of respondents favor building more power plants up from 32 percent in January. The second most popular solution re-regulating the electricity industry was the favored solution in January. ??-Traffic congestion affordable housing air pollution and a shortage of good jobs top the list of negative consequences respondents foresee from the state's population growth.

Headlines proclaimed a crisis and legislative leaders shifted into an I told you so mode. ??Hold the phone. ??This is not California. There is no crisis. Customers with interruptible service contracts have always been subject to cutoffs in times of peak consumption or when generators are down. ??It may not be fair to suggest that Alliant Energy chose to idle three of its biggest generators to make the case for changing the law but the timing is nonetheless convenient. The Legislature is set to convene a special session in a few weeks and among the business left over from the regular session could be a bill to make it easier for power companies to build electric generating plants. ??While crisis is not imminent Iowa does face the prospect of consuming more electricity than the state's utilities are able to generate themselves. ... ??While Iowa's law may need some streamlining which could be dealt with in a special session that should not be the end of the matter. Ultimately the Legislature must fashion a long-range energy policy for this state that takes a regional view of energy that reflects new market and regulation realities and that seizes the potential for conservation and renewable alternatives to fossil fuels. ??Legislative session: ??TELEGRAPH HERALD ??Even after a marathon legislative session - this one lasted 121 days - why does it always seem the big-ticket items are pushed through in the final days? ??This year's session started out strong passing a bill to save taxpayers money by eliminating the sales tax on residential utility bills. It finished up by coming through with $40 million for teachers' pay. ??But just what happened in those middle 100 or so days is a little murky. There was plenty of hand-wringing about the budget shortfall the usual banter about dove hunting and a fair amount of partisan bickering. ... ??-Legislators didn't get around to a ... bill to close a loophole in Iowa's Open Records law. The way it stands now a governmental body can use a private contractor to investigate problems within the department and keep that contractor's report confidential under the law's whistle-blower provision. ... ??-The Legislature didn't want to get into a full-blown gambling debate so it didn't address a tax freeze at racetracks. ... The issue of fairness needs to be addressed. ??Floating casinos pay a 20 percent tax while racetracks pay a gradually increasing tax that now stands at 30 percent. Under the law enacted in 1997 that tax will grow to 36 percent by 2004. ??-Other things that legislators talked about but didn't get around to include: cutting state income tax on Social Security income and a pair of bills addressing the state's bottle-deposit law. ??So the 2002 Legislature will have its work cut out for it. Here are some jobs for next year's to-do list: ??-Amend the Open Records Law. Allowing agencies to keep information about government activities secret simply because it is in the possession of an outside contractor is a hole in the law that needs to be fixed. ??-Carry the ball on increasing teachers' pay. The $40 million shot in the arm will have been a waste if the program is left hanging unfunded. ??-Freeze the amount of tax racetracks pay where it stands and stop the hemorrhaging of dollars into state coffers. The disparity between racetracks and riverboat casinos needs to be righted. ??And if they're worried that the discussion will draw an all-out gambling debate lawmakers might want to bring it to the table before May. ??IOWA CITY PRESS-CITIZEN: ??We agree with Gov. Tom Vilsack that the new state budget approved by legislators will cause hardship for people and families across our state. ??That's what happens when you face a $300 million revenue shortfall and you don't have as much money as you wanted. ??But we disagree that for 3 1/2 months they did very little. ??On the contrary Vilsack got what he said all along would be the high mark of this session - $40 million for teacher pay raises and a new system for teacher pay. ??And the Republican-led Legislature also agreed to phase out the sales tax on utilities long a goal of Vilsack's Democratic Party. ??Are we happy with the budget? No. ??Is it the best we likely can do under the circumstances? Yes. ??Vilsack should sign budget legislation rather than vetoing it and calling a special session of the Legislature this summer. ... ??Plant Sciences Institute: ??DES MOINES REGISTER: ??Iowa needs more people especially young people. Iowa needs more jobs that pay well - the kinds of jobs that cause other businesses small and large to spring up here. So why did Iowa lawmakers blow the single best opportunity for both? ??They blame it on a tight budget. Blame them for failing to grasp the big picture. The fledgling Plant Sciences Institute at Iowa State University could become a major force in the fast-growing field of biotechnology related to agriculture - yet the 2001 Legislature provided no new money. ??It did continue the $4.67 million approved in 2000. It did not add $3 million a meager increase proposed by the governor. It allowed ISU to keep money from the sale of land with proceeds to be used for the institute's Roy J. Carver Co-Laboratory to be completed by 2002. It should have added at least $10 million in cash. ... ??Because of legislative inaction promising initiatives must slow down or may never take place. ... ??The institute had hoped to hire another top researcher in the field of corn genomics ... ??Ag-biotech companies have been appealing to the state for help putting together a protein-extraction facility ... Such a facility might extract protein from conventional or genetically modified plants for such uses as pharmaceuticals food additives or chemical enzymes for industrial processes. The Plant Sciences Institute has a small pilot protein-extraction facility. New money from the Legislature would have allowed it to assist businesses in establishing a commercial facility. But now? The people interested in this will probably go elsewhere said Director Stephen Howell. ??Why wouldn't they? Plenty of other states are serious about fostering biotech industries. The Iowa commitment is hardly encouraging. ... ??Iowa has a budget crunch because its economy and population are not growing fast enough. Investing in biotechnology - the technology that is expected to drive the next great wave of economic growth - is the most promising way to make Iowa's economy and population grow. Stinting on that investment is stunningly shortsighted. ??Ten million dollars next session should not be out of the question. The question should be what sort of future will Iowa have if it does not make the most of the potential the Plant Sciences Institute holds. ??Hunting requirements: ??AMES TRIBUNE: ??In April the Iowa House and Senate rejected a measure that would have required wild turkey hunters to report their harvest to the Department of Natural Resources saying it was just another hassle for hunters. ??Then the House hiked the fees for hunting licenses in some cases up to 218 percent. A non-resident who wants to hunt deer in Iowa under this plan will have to shell out $308 including a hunting license and habitat fee. The current total is $156. ??Hassle? You got it. We might as well hang a sign on Iowa borders that says we don't much care about managing our wildlife and we don't want you here either. Add to the mix a federal whammy in the Freedom to Farm Act which has all but eliminated any fence rows and hunting as a potential tourism draw to Iowa blows away in the wind. ... ??Instead of having accurate information on how much hunting is affecting turkey populations Department of Natural Resources wildlife managers are now left to guess. ... ??Surrounding states which capitalize on their resources require even more harvest registration and it hasn't slowed interest. ... ??The DNR asked for the fee increases for good reasons - license fees have not increased for a decade while the costs of salaries travel and equipment have begun to eat into funds available for facilities and land acquisition. And we're in favor of using fees to support wildlife management. ??We also would allow that some of the increases do not seem to us to be egregious. A $3 fish habitat fee for instance isn't a great deal to pay. Nor is a $30 tab for a non-resident 7-day fishing license out of line. ??But some fee hikes were too much. ??In particular the non-resident fees for deer hunting are high especially in comparison to surrounding states and are more than most ordinary people are likely to pay. Wisconsin charges non-residents $135 to hunt deer. Missouri charges $125. License fees in Iowa are likely to result in less money coming in not more. What out-of-state hunter will be drawn to Iowa when surrounding states are managing their herds better and charging less to visit? ??Iowa worries that the farm economy is in the tank. We wring our hands as our young people rush to other parts of the country. We say that our natural resources here can be an attraction that will draw people back. Yet these votes run counter to sound wildlife management and increased tourism. ??Public official recruits: ??QUAD-CITY TIMES: ??More Iowa school districts and local governments are using professional companies to help find high-level administrators such as superintendents but that recruiting tool is making the process less accountable to the public. ??In effect it allows private firms to dictate public policy and that's troubling. ??One example of this trend is the Camanche School District where six finalists for the superintendents job were in town for interviews recently. They met with school board members district staff and some residents yet the board does not intend to reveal the names of the candidates. The Cedar Rapids headhunter firm that has contracted with the district advised the school board not to announce the names. ??Headhunters also are advising candidates to request their names be kept confidential. Under Iowa law a public entity such as a school board must honor such a request. ??Some public officials justify this secrecy by arguing that finalists don't want the public to know if they didn't get the job offer or worry that identification may jeopardize their current position. ... ??Those arguments aren't justified for reasons including: ??-There is nothing dishonorable in not being chosen for a top-level post. Indeed being considered a finalist for such a job may serve only to enhance a candidates attractiveness for another position ... ??-Identifying the finalists for the public also allows citizens to ask questions and provide other information critical or supportive that could be useful in helping officials make a final choice. ??-And being upfront with the public lends credibility to the entire process ... ??We prefer a process similar to one used by the City of Clinton during its recent search for a city administrator. The five finalists were not only identified they took part in an open house to meet the public. A headhunter firm was used but City Attorney Bruce Johansen himself a candidate who did not get the job said he made it clear to the agency that the finalists names should be made public. ??We applaud that effort ... ??Meanwhile the Iowa Legislature this spring modified a state law that has been the basis of confidentiality claims for candidates seeking public positions. The change would require that official communication between private contractors and the public entities they serve be open to public inspection. Whether that law will be interpreted to include headhunter firms remains to be seen. ... ??We encourage school boards and local governments to resist confidentiality and test the new law when it takes effect July 1. ??Train service: ??CEDAR RAPIDS GAZETTE: ??Who'd have thought that the selection of the secretary of the federal Department of Human Services last winter might affect whether Davenport Iowa City and Des Moines get rail service. ??But consider that HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson who resigned recently from the Amtrak board had been a strong advocate of expanded rail service here in the Midwest while he was governor of Wisconsin. Thompson had hoped to remain chairman of the Amtrak board after he went to Washington. But the Associated Press reports that a 1997 law that restructured the Amtrak board says only one of the seven seats can be held by a member of the Cabinet - and the Bush administration wants Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta on the governing board. ??Few people around are as passionate as Thompson about Amtrak and Iowa could have benefited. It's hard to ride a national passenger train service that doesn't go where the majority of Iowans live. Maybe the service will be expanded here. But maybe with the changes in the governing board that train has already left the station. ??Smoker identification: ??LE MARS DAILY SENTINAL: ??Have you heard the news from Walgreen's? They're going to card everybody who wants to buy a package of cigarettes a box of cigars a can of chew. ??Everybody. Not under 18. Not 27 and under. Everybody. ... ??That can't have been an easy decision. Within a year they're looking at software that will require clerk's to enter a customer's birth date into a computer before a tobacco sale can be completed. Until then they're asking their clerks to card everybody. Good for them. ... ??Yes it will take a little extra time ... Evidently the owners/corporate bigwigs think the time is well spent if it eliminates the fines and bad publicity. ??A convenience store association spokesman told reporters that other stores are likely to duplicate Walgreen's efforts. Yes. We certainly hope so. ??We all have heard terrible numbers of deaths caused by tobacco of underage users ... Many if not most of us know someone who hacks and coughs who died from smoking who cries because someone died from smoking. When you think of them it doesn't seem so outrageous to card everyone. It seems downright brilliant. ... ??It won't stop it entirely. Young wanna-be-smokers will have somebody older do the buying or swipe a carton. There will always be a way to get around it there always is. ??Still carding everyone says This is important we mean it and we're not going to make it easy for you.

HAINES: So where do we stand now? GLYNN: Well we're working our way through the federal bankruptcy proceeding where we affirmatively stepped in order to resolve issues between ourselves and our creditors. We have a plan of reorganization under development and we're getting close to the time when we can begin to share that plan with the creditors who after all need to get paid. HAINES: So let's first talk about time. How much time do you think this might take before PG&E emerges from bankruptcy? GLYNN: Well it's very hard to tell for one reason. There have not been very many utility bankruptcies and I don't know of any that has had these complexities to it. The shortest possible time or shortest likely time that I've heard about has been six to eight months and that's probably shorter than it will take. The longest that I've heard about is about four years and that's an awful lot longer than I want it to take. HAINES: In the meantime you are selling electricity transmitting and selling electricity on a retail level. Are you still losing money on your operating? GLYNN: Well the potential area for continuing loss exposure is the issue of whether the California independent system operator is still buying on behalf of our company instead of buying directly on behalf of our customers. And that's an issue that's before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for decision making right now. HAINES: Well I guess my question is who is paying the bills right now? GLYNN: Well the electric rates in California have just been raised by the California Public Utilities Commission in order to have the state the Department of Water Resources be able to recover all of its costs because that's what of course it wants to do. It doesn't want to go any deeper in debt than it has to. So this most recent large rate increase has applied as best as we can tell exclusively to cover the state's cost increases and not to cover some of the ones that we're responsible for. JOE BATTIPAGLIA: Mr. Glynn the brownouts continue in California. What's the status of supply of electricity into the state putting aside for a moment how you pay for it? GLYNN: Well the California electricity crisis at its heart is a supply shortage and the outlook for this summer and next summer are pretty bleak. Every responsible entity that has reviewed the situation is forecasting that there will be a large number of rolling blackouts occurring over the summer of 2001 and probably 2002 as well simply because there's not enough power to go around. BATTIPAGLIA: Does that spread from California to other states as the draw down becomes perilous? GLYNN: Well the California electricity market and the Pacific Northwest markets have had a very nice symbiotic relationship over many many years shipping power back and forth to one another. That has been interrupted because of the supply shortage in California which means that California is trying to be a net importer all the time. And it seems like the Pacific Northwest won't have the kind of surplus energy to send south to California that it's had in the past. HAINES: Does this ultimately end with retail electricity distribution transmission and distribution being done by a state authority and no longer by privately held or publicly held companies? GLYNN: I don't think it ends there at all Mark. And I certainly don't think that it's in the state's interest to try to get into businesses that can be done by private capital when the state has so many other important things to use its capital on like education and infrastructure. And I do think that this supply shortage has got to be resolved. It's got to be resolved by building new supply. There's simply no alternative to that and that's going to take another couple of years before that new construction is fully completed. HAINES: All right sir. Thank you very much for the update. We appreciate it. Robber Glynn PG&E's Chairman and CEO.

BODY: ??THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. ??ANNOUNCER: Live from Washington this is INSIDE POLITICS with Judy Woodruff. ??Amid growing bloodshed in the Middle East the United States endorses recommendations aimed at ending the violence. ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??COLIN POWELL U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: It is now up to the leaders in the region to show that they have heard this clarion call from this committee in a loud and clear way. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??ANNOUNCER: Also ahead: Is President Bush taking a hit in the polls in connection with the energy crunch? ??And to what degree has a certain Yale graduate finally embraced his alma mater? ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??GEORGE W. BUSH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Everything I know about the spoken word I learned right here at Yale. ??(LAUGHTER) ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??ANNOUNCER: Now Judy Woodruff takes you INSIDE POLITICS. ??JUDY WOODRUFF CNN ANCHOR: Thank you for joining us. ?We begin with the Bush administration responding to pressure to get more involved in promoting Middle East peace. ??As an escalating cycle of violence between Israelis and Palestinians continued today Secretary of State Colin Powell appointed a diplomat to help the two sides end the fighting and resume talks. ?And he urged the parties to use the report of a commission appointed by former President Clinton as a springboard to peace. ??Let's get more now from CNN national security correspondent David Ensor -- David. DAVID ENSOR CNN CORRESPONDENT: Judy Ambassador William Burns the U.S. ambassador to Jordan who is Mr. Powell's pick to be the next assistant secretary for the Middle East has been asked to work with other recommendations for Mr. Powell and for President Bush on how the U.S. can best proceed from here trying to use the recommendations of the Mitchell committee report to try to get the violence to de- escalate to try to get the two sides talking instead of shooting at each other. ??Here is how Mr. Powell put it today. ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??POWELL: It is now up to the leaders in the region to show that they have heard this clarion call from this committee in a loud-and- clear way and take actions that are available to them on both sides to let's have a cessation of hostilities then we can begin the confidence-building measures and move toward negotiations. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??ENSOR: Now this report makes very specific recommendations and urges very specific actions by both sides: in both cases quite difficult actions. ?First it calls for the Palestinians and the Israelis to declare an immediate unconditional cessation of violence. That's the first step and that's the step that Secretary Powell repeatedly emphasized today must come first and must come right away or else nothing else will work. ??But the report goes on to make specific recommendations. ?For example it urges that Israel put -- freeze all settlement development all development of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories. ?It recommends that Israel resume paying the money that's collected in taxes back to the Palestinian Authority. ?It recommends a whole range of action many of them to be taken by Israel which the reports says would help bring the tone back to where it needs to be would help bring the two sides back to where they could once again be negotiating instead of shooting at each other and letting off bombs. ??The -- the secretary Secretary Powell said that this is not the time however for him to get involved in shuttle diplomacy. ?He wants first to have Ambassador Burns and the others come up with recommendations over the next week two weeks or three and then he and the president will try to figure out where the U.S. can go from here. ??But clearly this is -- clearly this is a first step by an administration that until now has tried to keep its -- keep its powder a bit dry in the Middle East. ?They are now engaging somewhat because they're so concerned about the situation out there Judy. ??WOODRUFF: David the report the Mitchell report suggesting that the Israelis more responsible here or at least that they have more to do in order to get things back on the peace track than the Palestinians? ENSOR: The report is very even-handed. ?It doesn't blame either side for the situation. ?It for example does not blame Ariel Sharon's visit to the Temple Mount for the following Intifada Intifada II it's been called. ?But it says that there needs to be a series of actions by both sides to bring down the tensions and if you look at the list of what it's asking for there are more steps that the Israelis would have to take than the Palestinians. ??WOODRUFF: And David why is it that the administration is saying at this point that it is not prepared to get back in -- in a -- in a day-to-day way in an energetically involved way the way the Clinton administration was? ??ENSOR: Well I think the administration this administration feels that the Clinton people got -- got to the point where they were micromanaging the thing a little bit. ?It was too much presidential involvement and it was too much of a day-to-day hand-holding operation. ?They feel they need to hold back a little bit and try to get the parties to talk to each other. ??However the situation is deteriorating pretty rapidly and so now they realize they have to have some greater involvement. ?And that's why Ambassador Burns has been asked to prepare these recommendation Judy. ??WOODRUFF: All right. ?David Ensor reporting for us from the State Department. ??For more on the Middle East conflict stay with us for a special half-hour report. ?That's beginning at 6:00 p.m. Eastern. ??Now we turn to questions about the Bush administration's political fund-raising tactics. ?Tonight Vice President Dick Cheney is scheduled to host some 400 big GOP donors at his official residence in Washington. ?A spokeswoman for the Democrats says that that event smacks of in her words hypocrisy. ??The Democrats say the reception at the vice president's home is comparable to Clinton-era events such as White House coffees and Lincoln Bedroom sleepovers for big donors which drew heavy criticism from Republicans. ?Among them: presidential candidate George W. Bush. ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??BUSH: I believe they've moved that sign The buck stops here from the Oval Office desk to the buck stops here on the Lincoln Bedroom. ?And that's not good for the country it's not right. ?We need to have a new look about how we conduct ourselves in office. There's a huge trust. ?I see it all the time when people come up to me and say I don't want you to let me down again. ??And we can do better than the past administration has done. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??WOODRUFF: Despite that sort of criticism then the Republicans are defending their fund-raising tactics now. ?Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott had this to say about the reception for big donors at Vice President Cheney's home tonight. ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??SEN. TRENT LOTT (R-MS) MAJORITY LEADER: I'm sure it's being done in an inappropriate way or Dick Cheney wouldn't -- wouldn't be doing it. ?So if there's any question I'd suggest you address it to them. ?Unfortunately I think that most of us will not be able to be there. ?We're going to be here voting giving tax relief. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??WOODRUFF: Virtually all of those GOP contributors who will mingle with Vice President Cheney at his home tonight have given at least $100000 to the Republican National Committee. ?They will also attend a major RNC fund-raiser tomorrow night that features President Bush as the main speaker and is expected to net some $15 million in soft money. ??Now let's bring in our White House correspondent Major Garrett. ??Major tell us about what this event is about tomorrow night. ??MAJOR GARRETT CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well it's the first official Republican National Committee event to honor the president and the first lady as you said. The targeted haul is $15 million. Republican National Committee officials tell CNN that it's about 70 percent of that 15 million will be soft money. ?About 30 percent will be hard dollars -- that is dollars that are regulated under the existing campaign finance scheme -- and that it is a big event one that the Republican Party has held for years and years in Washington. ??As for what's happening in the vice president's residence tonight White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer told me this is a way of saying Thank you in his words to those Republicans who as Ari Fleischer said did so much to help win the selection. ??And he draws a distinction with the Clinton-era coffees and sleepovers describing them as quote organized schemes to bring people through the gates of the White House to get money or to persuade others to do so. ??Mark Minor who is the communications director for the Republican National Committee also said that no one paid to go to the vice president's residence. No checks will pass between hands there. There is no quid pro quo and that some people who will be at the vice president's residence tonight are not in fact RNC donors -- Judy. ??WOODRUFF: So Major again clarify the distinction between money events that are given as a thank you and events that are given as an encouragement to give more money. ??GARRETT: Well it's a distinction this White House wants to draw as clearly as it possibly can. ?In the words of Ari Fleischer thanking someone whether it's on government property or not on government property is a completely legitimate activity for the president or the vice president to engage in. ?The distinction he is drawing is that during the Clinton era people were brought to the White House to these coffees and as was disclosed in the Thompson report that was conducted by the Senate investigating that there was some evidence of actually targeted lists: that people who were brought in money was described to bringing in for a coffee. ?A certain dollar amount was attached to donations to the Democratic National Committee a larger amount if they in fact slept here at the White House in the Lincoln Bedroom. ?That is the key distinction the Republicans say: that there is no targeting necessarily of these people to come to the vice president's residence. ??They also point out that the original letters inviting these big donors to Washington did not in any way suggest there would be a reception at the vice president's residence: the point there being these people donated without any expectation of having dinner or reception with Lynne Cheney and Dick Cheney in the vice president's home. ??WOODRUFF: And Major just to clarify the 400 people invited tonight to the vice president's how many are they saying did not give money? ??GARRETT: They're not disclosing any numbers. ?They're only saying that some have given. ?They clearly and readily acknowledge that. ?Some are lobbyists. Some represent large corporations. ?But others they say are just Republican National Committee officials. And others of an undisclosed nature -- not fund-raisers not Republican Party officials -- who will be there tonight. Don't have any numbers for you on that though. ??WOODRUFF: All right Major Garrett reporting at the White House. Thank you very much. ??Vice President Cheney maybe taking some heat for fund-raising tactics not to mention his role in creating the Bush energy plan. Look that this: ??Our new poll shows Cheney's job approval rating is 4 points higher than the presidents. ?While Mr. Bush's approval rating has held pretty steady in the past couple of weeks he has lost ground since late April. ?Cheney's approval rating has dipped as well. ??For more on Mr. Bush's ratings and how they relate to his policies we are joined now by our senior political analyst Bill Schneider. ??Tell us Bill which of Mr. Bush's policies is the most popular? ??WILLIAM SCHNEIDER CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well you might guess energy given the high ratings for Dick Cheney that you just reported -- but you would be wrong. ??Because what Americans like best is the tax cut. ?Two thirds of the public now favors a substantial tax cut. ?That's up from 60 percent earlier this month. Well why not? ?What's wrong with getting some money back from the government? ??Actually most people do not think the tax cut could benefit them much financially. ?They like it because they believe it will help the economy. ?And that is why so many Democrats find it very difficult to oppose. ??WOODRUFF: What about the energy plan? ??SCHNEIDER: Not such a success. ?Not like the tax cut. ?Americans are actually divided over the president's energy plan. ?Why? ?It's not because the public blames the Bush administration for the nation's energy problems. ?Most people blame the oil companies. ??In fact more people blame Congress and the Clinton administration and environmental laws and American consumers than blame the Bush administration. But most Americans still give President Bush low marks on energy. ?The core criticism of his energy plan is: it doesn't do enough. ?55 percent of Americans say President Bush is not doing enough to solve the country's energy problems. ??What doesn't the plan do? ?It doesn't do much right now. ?Only 8 percent of Americans believe the plan will help the nation's energy problem immediately. Most people think oh it will help but only after several years. ?It's a long-run solution. ?Americans want help now. ?Right now. ?With electricity in California. ?And with gas prices all over the country. ?Long-term solutions are important but politics is a short-term business. ?If the problem is now people want results now. ??And they don't see what the Bush energy plan is going to do about $2-a-gallon gasoline now. ??WOODRUFF: Why do people think the energy plan fails to do that? ??SCHNEIDER: Because they think this administration is run by oilmen. ?Oilmen like $2-a-gallon gasoline. ?Maybe even 3. ??By nearly two to one the public believes energy companies have too much influence over the Bush administration's policies. ?In fact Americans are split when you ask them whether the Bush energy plan is designed to further the country's interests or the energy companies' interests. ?That sounds like breathtaking cynicism. ?But any administration that's run by Texas oilmen is automatically suspect. ??WOODRUFF: All right Bill Schneider thank you very much. You're not suspect. ??SCHNEIDER: I am certainly not. ??WOODRUFF: At least as far as we know. ??Do Californians blame President Bush for their energy crisis? We've heard a little bit from Bill on that. ?That answer and more on the issue later this hour. ?Plus: ??Just what kind of tax cut is the Senate considering? ?Jonathan Karl crunches the numbers. ?Also: ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have no ability to bring up the amendments. ?You don't set the agenda every day and that is real power in the House. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??WOODRUFF: The trials and tribulations of the minority leader as he considers the present and the future. ?And later: ??Rewarding a president's most controversial decision. ?A political Profile In Courage. All ahead on INSIDE POLITICS. ??(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ??WOODRUFF: President Bush today donned the traditional commencement robes and gave the graduating class at Yale University a few bits of advice. ?The president also included a glimpse at his less-than-perfect college years. ?As CNN's Kelly Wallace reports today's speech was a departure from how the President's dealt with his alma mater in the past. ??(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ??KELLY WALLACE CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A homecoming of sorts George W. Bush who has only been back to his alma mater once since graduating in 1968 returns to address those at the top and the bottom of Yale's graduating class. ??BUSH: And to the C students... ??(LAUGHTER) ??I say you too can be president of the United States. ??(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) ??WALLACE: The president offering a self-deprecating account of his days as the undergraduate when as a history major he earned modest grades and was known more as a fraternity boy prankster than a rising political star. ??The visit was not without controversy with some students protesting and some professors boycotting charging that Mr. Bush was not yet deserving of an honorary degree. ??PETER BROOKS YALE UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR: It doesn't seem at present to represent the intellectual ideals and the service to humanity in which we think that Yale stands for. ??WALLACE: The president has kept his distance from this Ivy League institution for most of his political life painting it as a symbol of elitism even during his days at Yale. TERRY JOHNSON BUSH'S YALE ROOMMATE: What George -- does not respond well to are people who are snobs whether you are a social snob or an intellectual snob or any other kind of snob. ??WALLACE: Mr. Bush rarely mentions what he did on this day that he was born in New Haven when his dad the former president was an undergraduate at Yale. ??BUSH: My life began just a few blocks from here but I was raised in West Texas. ?From there Yale always seemed a world away. ??WALLACE: The president for years had been miffed with Yale for not awarding an honorary degree to his dad until 1991 the third year of his presidency. ?But it appears now all is forgiven. ??BUSH: In my time they spoke of the Yale man I was really never sure of what that was. ?But I do think that I am a better man because of Yale. ??WALLACE: Mr. Bush the son and grandson of Yalies and now father of a current student seems very proud that Yale is a part of his past. ??Kelly Wallace CNN New Haven Connecticut. ??(END VIDEOTAPE) ??WOODRUFF: And looking now ahead to 2004: the Reverend Al Sharpton says that he will explore seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. ?The civil rights activist said yesterday that the party did not protect the rights of disenfranchised voters in Florida in the last presidential race. ??If he runs Sharpton said that he would promote issues that concern blacks and progressives and his effort would not be just symbolic. ?Sharpton ran unsuccessfully for the Senate in New York in 1994 and for mayor of New York City in 1997. ??Reverend Sharpton and former Republican presidential candidate Gary Bauer will discuss President Bush's faith-based plan to help the poor tonight on CROSSFIRE. That's at 7:30 p.m. Eastern. ??Another note from New York: a state supreme court justice today barred Rudy Giuliani's girlfriend from the mayor's official residence Gracie Mansion. ?The judge ruled in favor of Giuliani's estranged wife Donna Hanover who had requested a restraining order barring Judith Nathan from the residence. ?The ruling says that Nathan may not enter the residence as long as the Giuliani children continue to live there. ?The judge also denied Giuliani's second attempt for a gag order in the couple's divorce proceedings. ??And we'll have the latest on President Bush's tax cut when we come back. ??(COMMERCIAL BREAK) WOODRUFF: This evening the Senate is expected to vote on the latest version of the now $1.35 trillion tax cut plan. ?Republican leaders hope to give President Bush the tax cut for approval before Memorial Day. ?But as Jonathan Karl reports taxpayers will have a longer wait before reaping any of the measure's benefits. ??(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ??JONATHAN KARL CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Senate's $1.35 trillion tax cut would be the biggest in a generation but don't spend your tax windfall yet. ?Most of the cuts will not take effect for several years to come. ??Relief from the so-called major penalty will not start until the year 2005. The estate tax won't be repealed until 2011. ?That means even if President Bush is re-elected it wouldn't take effect until two years after he completed his second term. ?The IRA contribution limit would be raised from $2000 to $5000 but that also wouldn't happen until the year 2011. ??The tax cut calls for doubling of the child tax credit but that takes 10 years too. ?The credit would rise from $500 to $600 this year slowly increasing in $100 increments over the next 10 years until it finally reaches $1000 in the year 2011. ?The cuts in income tax rates would be phased in even more slowly. ??SEN. CHARLES GRASSLEY (R-IA) FINANCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: You are right some of them do not -- are phased in over a period of time. But there is real relief in this tax bill for every taxpayer starting January 1 2001. ?They don't have to wait until next year. ??KARL: That immediate tax relief amounts to $300 for individuals and $600 for couples filing jointly but just how that money gets back to taxpayers is still to be worked out. ?The option favored by the president is a simple rebate check sent directly to taxpayers an idea opposed by many Senate Republicans who call it impractical. ??But the rebate would represent a fraction of the overall tax cut which Democratic opponents say will explode in cost after it's fully phased in two years from now. ??SEN. KENT CONRAD (D) NORTH DAKOTA: This plan is fully back- loaded. ?That means simply that it is disguised in terms of its full cost. ?This decade it cost $1.35 trillion. ?In the next decade it will cost from 3.5 to $4 trillion. ??KARL: But there's a little noticed provision of this tax cut that may make that point moot. ?The tax cut includes a sunset provision that means all the tax cuts in the bill would expire in the year 2012. ?For the tax cuts to remain in place Congress would have to pass them again. ??(END VIDEOTAPE) ??KARL: Now the Senate is expected to vote on a series of amendments to the tax cut later on today paving the way for a final vote on the tax cut here in the Senate tonight. ?But it will not end there. ?This still needs to be reconciled with the tax cut that was passed in House the House passing almost exactly the president's tax cut including much deeper cuts in income tax rates preferred by Republicans. ??The Senate and the House will have to work out their differences. They're expected to do so this week setting the stage to send this final tax cut down Pennsylvania Avenue and onto the president's desk by Memorial Day -- Judy. ??WOODRUFF: Jon when you talk about the plan providing 300 or $300 a year per individual divided by 12 that's $20-some a month. Is this the kind of money the president was talking about when he said the tax cut would help people with higher gasoline prices? ??KARL: This was exactly what he had it mind. ?This was exactly what he was talking about directing the money right into the hands of taxpayers directly into the hands of those people paying higher gasoline prices at the pumps. ??This is an idea that his Treasury secretary Paul O'Neill strongly favors the idea of direct cash payments or check payments to taxpayers. ?But one big problem with this Judy is that taxpayers over the course of time move they change addresses some of them die. The question is how do you make sure you get all the right checks to those people at current addresses? ?It's not an easy proposition. ??WOODRUFF: And Jon one other subject we know the president's nominee to be solicitor general of the United States has run into a real problem in the Senate committee. ?Where does that stand right now? ?The last we heard the Senate Judiciary had split 9-9 on the nomination of Ted Olson. ??KARL: Well the Senate leaders Trent Lott and Tom Daschle are now actively involved in this trying to come to some kind of an agreement an agreement that will allow the Democrats to get access to some information they want about Olson especially information that was compiled by independent council Robert Ray looking to just what Olson's involvement was in that Arkansas Project by the American Spectator magazine the investigation into Bill Clinton's personal life. ??They want information from the independent council to look at just how involved Olson was in that project to see whether or not he was truthful in his testimony when he said he was not very involved at all. ?There's some movement to try to get the Democrats on the committee more of the information also maybe to release more of it to the public. ??If that's all done it would set the stage for a vote on the Olson nomination before the full Senate but probably not until after Memorial Day. ?The Senate goes on recess at the end of the week they will be off all of next week you probably won't see a vote on the Olson nomination until after they return. ??WOODRUFF: All right Jon Karl at the Capitol thanks. In the House of Representatives Democrats are finding themselves drowned out by the Republican majority. ?Add to that critics who say the party is lacking leadership and strategy. ?And life in the House minority begins to look bleak. ?Our Kate Snow caught up with the House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt to talk about the balance of power and his political future. ??(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ??REP. DICK GEPHARDT (D-MO) HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: We need to say what are we for and that's what... ??KATE SNOW CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Dick Gephardt will tell you it's frustrating being a Democrat these days stuck in the minority without the backing of the White House. ??GEPHARDT: Well you take what you -- what you are given. ?I mean the people run this country. ?We don't. ?And so you fight for what you believe in as hard as you can and if you really believe in it then you're frustrated if you're not able to those policies through. ??SNOW: Gephardt says the Democrats are forced to play defense responding to Republicans. ??GEPHARDT: I think we slowed down a little bit the amount of the tax bill -- not enough in my view -- but we lowered it some so that the potential deficits out there in the future won't be so large. ?I think we cooperated with the president on the educational bill at least the substance of it but we still haven't been able to convince him or the Republicans to put enough money into education to really make the program happen. ??On energy I think that we've got a very very positive alternative that I hope people will listen to. ?People in California and Oregon and Washington need help now. ??SNOW: That was last week's theme. ?First at a gas station the lawn of the Capitol the next day and then in a underground war room. ??Gephardt is a master at staying on message often spending hours talking to the press his strategy: agree with Republicans when he thinks they're right and hammer at home when he disagrees. ??GEPHARDT: If we do not learn from history we are forced to repeat it. ?This is a mistake that we will pay for for years to come. ??I try not to yell. ?I try to get ideas across as good a way as I can. ?But there are times when you need to show your emotion. ?You need to let people know that you really care about this. ?And you really want the country to go in a different direction. ?And I think you can't appear too tentative or too laid back or too uninterested. ??SNOW: But is the strategy working? ??I have talked to some Democrats who say that they are truly unhappy. Some of whom say that they are unhappy with your leadership. ?They don't feel that you're doing an effective job. ?Do you feel that there is trouble within the ranks? ??GEPHARDT: I don't. ?I think that -- I think the ranks and the Democratic Party are largely unified. ?They are marching together and working together in ways that I've never seen them before. ?I always tell them that it's me and we. And we have to be a team. ??I would never tell you that anybody is ever going to be pleased every day with everything that happens but largely I think that we've achieved real unity and real effectiveness in being the loyal opposition here in Washington. ??SNOW: How much of your days are spent thinking about 2002 in the next election? ??GEPHARDT: Well I want to win the majority back. ?I think it's really important not for the party and not for me but for the country. ??SNOW: Is it more important to win back the majority than it is to win legislatively for the next couple of years? ??GEPHARDT: I think it is in the House for sure because the minority is really out of power totally in the House. ?You have no ability to bring up amendments you don't set the agenda every day. And that is real power in the House. ??SNOW: There is a lot of focus on 2004 a lot of talk about your ambitions do you have plans to run for president? ??GEPHARDT: I really think that if you don't stay totally focused on the goal that is ahead of you then you lessen your chances of reaching that goal. ?And my goal is to win back the majority in the Congress in 2002. ?I think as usual in our system we all want to look ahead and start calling the next race after that for president but that is not what I'm doing and not what I should be doing. ??SNOW (voice-over): Gephardt insists he's not planning ahead though he's scheduled to attend four events in New Hampshire in two weeks. ??GEPHARDT: The future will take of itself. ?I have no idea what will happen and I'm not worried about it and I don't spend time worrying about it. Because again I've got to do this in 2002. ?This is what we're trying to do. ??SNOW: So are you committed to staying minority leader through 2002? ??GEPHARDT: Absolutely. ?I'm totally committed to winning this House back and I think we are going to do it. ??SNOW: Speaker of the House you said to me last fall that that had a nice ring to it? GEPHARDT: It works for me. ??(END VIDEOTAPE) ??WOODRUFF: Kate Snow talking with House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt. ?They talked today. ?And later this week Kate will sit down with House Speaker Dennis Hastert. ?You can look for that report on Friday. ??On another term for the another high-profile Republican and two nationally known Democrats with apparent home state ambitions. ??INSIDE POLITICS will be right back. ??(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ??To no one's surprise Charlton Heston was reelected today to an unprecedented fourth term as president of the National Rifle Association. ?The 77-year-old actor was chosen at the NRA's annual convention in Kansas City. ?The group changed its rules last year to allow Heston a third term and a spokesman said there really wasn't much discussion by the board before deciding to elect him once again. ??Former Attorney General Janet Reno may be looking for a new line of work. Now back in her native Florida Reno says she finds the idea of running for governor appealing. ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??JANET RENO FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL: I love Florida very much. I was born and raised there. ?I have lived there most of my life. ?And I want to make sure that I do everything I can either as governor or otherwise to serve the interest of the people of Florida. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??WOODRUFF: Reno says she does not believe that her Parkinson's Disease would keep her from running and she expects to make a decision before the end of the year. ??Governor Jeb Bush says possible opponents do not factor into his decision on whether to run for reelection. ??House Minority Whip David Bonior may trade in his Congressional seat for a run at the governor's mansion. ?The 13-term Congressman from Michigan filed his paperwork today to become a candidate in Michigan's 2002 governor's race. ?His aides say that a formal announcement will come later. ?With Michigan slated to lose one House district Bonior's seat may be vulnerable to the state's Republican controlled redistricting efforts. ?Republican Governor John Engler cannot seek reelection because of term limits. ??Californians and the energy crunch: are they pointing fingers at the president? ?We'll check new poll numbers from the Golden State and discuss power politics in the state when we return. ??(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ??WOODRUFF: At ground zero on the energy crunch: more than half of Californians say they disapprove of the way President Bush is handling that state's power woes according to a new poll. ?But the survey shows more Californians are placing blame for the problem on utility companies former Governor Pete Wilson and current Governor Gray Davis than on President Bush and the federal government. ?The Democrats are trying hard to convince Californians that Republicans should be held accountable for the power problem. ?Here is a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ad that begins airing in Los Angeles today. ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??NARRATOR: California's energy crisis is deepening with summer blackouts predicted and rate hikes of up to 80 percent. Yet President Bush has offered no relief to hard-pressed rate payers. ?His spokesman saying The president continues to believe that the issue is mostly a California matter and our representative Stephen Horn has joined with Bush in opposing a temporary cap on electricity prices. ?Call Congressman Horn and tell him we need action now. ??That is if you can find the phone. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??WOODRUFF: The Democratic committee said that it has bought significant air time for that spot part of a month-long radio and TV ad campaign targeting Republicans on energy. ?Let's talk more now about energy politics with the director of that Public Policy Institute of California poll we just told you about Mark Baldassare joins us now from San Francisco. ??Mark first of all this poll finds Californians pessimistic in general did that surprise you? ??MARK BALDASSARE CALIFORNIA POLLSTER: It did. ?For the past three years we've been in an incredible time of optimism in California. ?Two-thirds of Californians have said that the state is going in the right direction. ?Most Californians felt that economic times would continue to be good and most Californians also were highly approving of the governor and the legislature. For the first time we've seen a dramatic drop in optimism about the state about the economy and ratings of the governor. ??WOODRUFF: And why do you think that is? ??BALDASSARE: Well eight in ten Californians say they have been closely following the electricity situation in the state and most Californians are telling us in our survey that they consider it the top issue and 80 percent of Californians say it's a big problem and moreover a problem that is going to effect the economy. ?So there's been a great deal of uncertainty that's been created by the electricity situation and because of that uncertainty people are beginning to feel very nervous about our state. ??WOODRUFF: So you're saying because of the electricity crisis if you want to call it that in California it's now driving people's views of everything: population the economy across-the-board. ??BALDASSARE: We -- for the past few years people have been focused on improving the schools for instance. ?Now only 6 percent in our most recent survey said that's the issue that concerns them most in the state. ?And we see that there is growing pessimism at the same time that there is growing concern that this electricity situation is not under control and could affect the state's economy. ??WOODRUFF: Explain for us Mark who people are blaming. ?We were -- Bill Schneider reported earlier on the program that Americans overall are having mixed views about to what extent President Bush is responsible. ?Here we're learning in California they hold President Bush far less responsible than they do local leaders. ??BALDASSARE: Yeah well we are at time right now in California where people haven't experienced the rate hikes yet. ?They've certainly heard about them. They haven't experienced for the most part frequent rolling blackouts but they hear that they're coming. And so when we talk about blame people are focused on what happened five years ago to put us into this situation. ?And for that of course they don't blame either the current governor or the current president. ?Now as we go forward over the next few months people are going to be re-assigning blame as well as re-evaluating the solutions that are in place and that's why I think both the Democrats and Republicans are very urgently trying to get their message out right now about who they think is to blame and who they think has the best solutions. ??WOODRUFF: Well Mark what is your reading on this? ?Are ads like the ones we just saw the Democrats running out there are those likely to have an effect on people's views? ??BALDASSARE: I don't think so. ?I think that what is will most going to have a effect on people's views over these next few months is how the crisis is actually resolved. ?And if people feel that these electricity hikes have really you know altered their lifestyle or they're going to impact the economy if they feel blackouts are really going to you know put them in an uncomfortable situation going through the summer then my guess is they are going to give blame both to Bush and to Davis. ??WOODRUFF: All right Mark Baldassare of the California Public Policy Institute. ?Thanks very much good to see you again. ??BALDASSARE: Thank you. ?Same here. ??WOODRUFF: As California tries to ease its energy problems there are concerns about the cost not only for consumers but for the environment. ?CNN's Rusty Dornin takes a closer look at the issues being raised by one California plant's effort to expand. ??(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ??RUSTY DORNIN CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): An aging giant known as the Mighty Moss. ?The 50-year-old Moss Landing Natural Gas plant along California's coast owned by Duke Energy. ?A face lift and an expansion will soon make this the largest power generator in the state providing 2.3 million homes with light heat and air conditioning. ?But all that power takes water to cool the turbines water that's home to otters fish herons and other wildlife. ??CAROLYN NIELSEN PLANT OPPONENT: Every day Duke will use 333 football-size fields -- pools of water that are 10 feet deep. ?That is just incomprehensible. ??DORNIN: Water from the wetlands run through the plant returning to the ocean 30 degrees warmer. ?Been that way for 50 years. ?Now environmentalists worry that increasing the intake will sterilize any creature sucked in. ??PATRICIA MATEJCEK SIERRA CLUB: Everything that lives in that volume of water: eggs from fish from clams diatoms young fish everything in it will be killed. ??DORNIN: Environmentalists say the Mighty Moss got a break on the approval process as regulators here faced the state's energy crisis. It took 14 months. Permitting for smaller plants in the state is down to 21 days. ??KAITILIN GAFFNEY CENTER FOR MARINE CONSERVATION: It's so fast that my concern is that we wouldn't even catch really obvious problems because we are just are not taking a hard look at these plants at all. ??DORNIN: But here's the twist as part of the permit process: local environmental groups signed off on the Mighty Moss renovation plan. ??GAFFNEY: So at the eleventh hour we were able to work out this deal with Duke to at least ensure that the scientific monitoring will go on. ??DORNIN (on camera): Duke Energy will spend more than $8 million expanding the wetlands and in donations to local environmental groups. There will also be an independent monitor who will assess any damage to the environment. ??TOM WILLIAMS DUKE ENERGY: This will more than compensate any potential effects that the new power plant will have on the habitat. This state is in an energy crisis. ?The new plant we're bringing on is cleaner more efficient than virtually any plant in the country today. ??DORNIN: Environmentalists made a deal here but many fear in a power-hungry state taking what they can get may be their only option. ??Rusty Dornin CNN Moss Landing California. ??(END VIDEOTAPE) ??WOODRUFF: A very different kind of power politics circa the 1970s is being seen in a whole new light in some circles. ?Former President Ford is honored for granting a famous -- some would say infamous -- at pardon. ??That's next on INSIDE POLITICS. ??(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ??WOODRUFF: It is something that many Americans that lived through the Watergate era might never dream they would see. ?An award named for a Democratic icon presented to the man who angered many Democrats by pardoning Richard Nixon. ??CNN's Bruce Morton has an inside view of this twist on political history. ??(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ??CAROLINE KENNEDY SCHLOSSBERG JOHN KENNEDY'S DAUGHTER: He placed his love of country ahead of his own political future. ?We are honored to present you President Ford with the John F. Kennedy Profile In Courage Award for 2001. ??(APPLAUSE) ??BRUCE MORTON CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Gerald Ford now 87 got the award because as a new unelected president he pardoned his predecessor Richard Nixon who had resigned in disgrace to avoid impeachment over the Watergate scandal. ??RICHARD M. NIXON 37TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow. ??MORTON: Our long national nightmare is over the new man said of Watergate. But really what would end it? ?Nixon could still face charges. ??GERALD FORD 38TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: My conscience tells me that only I as president have the constitutional power to firmly shut and seal this book. ??MORTON: And so he granted: ??FORD: A full free and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon. ??MORTON: Many Americans thought that was a mistake. ??SEN. TED KENNEDY (D) MASSACHUSETTS: I was one of those who spoke out against his actions then but time has a way of clarifying past events. ?And now we see that President Ford was right. ??MORTON: Not everyone agrees. ?Ford's press secretary at the time Gerald Ter Horst resigned to protest the Nixon pardon and still thinks it was wrong. ??JERRY TER HORST FORMER FORD PRESS SECRETARY: He was going to go off scot-free whereas all of his minions -- the people who worked at the White House from the chief of staff on down to Ehrlichman Chuck Colson and others -- they were going to have to do prison time they were not going to get pardons. MORTON: And it may have cost Ford the 1976 election. ?It was a close election. Many things could have swung it but the pardon was surely one. ?Jimmy Carter who beat Ford thanked him Inauguration Day. ??JAMES EARL CARTER 39TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: For myself and for our nation I want to thank my predecessor for all he has done to heal our land. ??MORTON: Accepting the award Ford talked about the need for courage today in a politics dominated by partisan jockeying at the expense of public policy. ??FORD: I sense a longing for community a desire on the part of Americans to be part of something bigger finer than themselves. ??MORTON: Historians may still argue about the pardon. ?They agree he cared about his country and its politics and did what he thought was right. ??Bruce Morton CNN Washington. ??(END VIDEOTAPE) ??WOODRUFF: Also cited for political courage today Democratic Congressman John Lewis of Georgia who was beaten as he and others challenged segregation during the freedom rides through the South in 1961. ??Lewis was given a special Profile of Courage Award for Lifetime Achievement. ??Former president Ford Congressman Lewis and Caroline Kennedy will all be guests tonight on WOLF BLITZER REPORTS.

Toshiba is uniting digital mobile and network innovations in a bold new vision of Information Technology for today and tomorrow. Take a closer look at life in the new Digital Age. And imagine how good IT can be. Visit Toshiba.com for more details. The Real Wolf RECKONINGS By PAUL KRUGMAN ecently I received a letter from an economist I respect chiding me for my Naderite columns on the California energy crisis. He just didn't believe that market manipulation by power companies could possibly be an important issue it sounded too much to him like the sort of thing one hears from knee-jerk leftists who blame greedy capitalists for every problem be it third-world poverty or high apartment rents. The left has cried Wolf! so many times that sensible people have learned to discount such claims. But now a bona fide wolf has arrived whose predatory behavior is doing terrible damage to our most populous state =01* and nobody will believe it. True California would be heading for a summer of power shortages even if it had never deregulated. And even if there was workable competition in the wholesale electricity market prices in that market would spike during periods of peak demand transferring billions of dollars from either taxpayers or consumers to the generators. But the evidence is now overwhelming that there isn't workable competition in California's power market and that the actions of generators gaming the system have greatly magnified the crisis. The key fact is that California has somehow remained in a state of more or less continuous power shortage and very high wholesale prices regardless of the level of demand. A rash of outages has kept the electricity market conveniently =01* and very profitably =01* short of supply even during periods of low demand when there ought to be lots of excess capacity. As Frank Wolak the Stanford economist who also advises the state's power grid has pointed out an outage at a power plant is a lot like an employee calling in sick. You can't tell directly whether he is really sick or has chosen to take the day off for other reasons but you can look for circumstantial evidence. And such evidence has convinced Mr. Wolak that generators use forced outages strategically to withhold capacity from the market =01* a view shared by a growing number of other researchers. Which brings us to the latest move by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. On Wednesday the commission apparently decided to offer California some relief and put new price caps in place on the California electricity market. I say apparently because the more you look at the plan the less likely it seems to be any help at all. Indeed the measure was passed on a 2-to-1 vote with William Massey =01* the one commissioner who has been sympathetic to calls for price controls =01* voting against it on the grounds that it would be ineffectual. What's wrong with FERC's plan? First it caps prices only in emergency conditions =01* ignoring the fact that electricity prices have stayed at hard- to-explain levels even when there is no emergency. In effect the plan is laid out as if the electricity market were really competitive in spite of all the evidence that it is not. Second even those emergency price caps are full of loopholes offering extensive opportunities for what Mr. Wolak calls megawatt laundering =01* selling power to affiliated companies that for one reason or another are exempted from the price controls (for example the controls do not apply to imports from neighboring states) then selling it back into the California market. Severin Borenstein of the University of California Energy Institute adds that because the allowed price depends on the cost of generation at the least efficient plant generators will have a clear incentive to produce inefficiently: I predict we will find some plants we never heard of before that are suddenly operating again and they will be pretty inefficient. The general verdict seems to be that this is not a serious plan. There are serious proposals to mitigate the crisis out there =01* indeed last fall Mr. Wolak submitted a proposal that was well received by other experts =01* but FERC has ignored all of them. The charitable interpretation is that FERC still doesn't get it that it just can't bring itself to believe that this time the wolf is real. The uncharitable interpretation is that last week's action was meant to fail. The Medley Report an online newsletter calls the FERC plan a grand exercise in posturing without substance . . . a very clever temporary move by the Bush administration to deflect any political fallout from the looming disaster. Whatever the explanation the plain fact is that FERC and the administration have yet to offer California any significant relief. &en=3D6a9 00f004b3b1abf Visit NYTimes.com for complete access to the most authoritative news coverage on the Web updated throughout the day.

 Attorney client privilege
Body:: I guess I don't have strong feelings if a dash is written here or not but I do care that a troubled situation receive the attention it requires to avoid getting in deeper. There always seems to be reluctance in UK to have a dash prepared Steve always used a huge amount of energy on justifying the task. We all know that if problem deals are not addressed they always get worse. Maybe Michael could be led to suggest an alternative memo or approach. A problem deal memo. If you all think a dash is the best approach do it and I don't care if they don't sign it. Once the website is functional it will be helpful to have a complete history of deals and having these kind of memos in dash format will aid this process. One final thought Michael is quite supportive of our effort and I think we should pick battles carefully. Rick

Subject:: White House To Support FERC Action Today
Body:: According to this morning's Washington Post the Bush Administration will support the expected FERC action today of extending the existing California price mitigation regime to 10 other Western states and to all days/all hours not just during California emergencies (stages 1 2 and 3). This action comes only a day before FERC and other witnesses will testify on the Feinstein/Smith price cap legislation before the Senate Energy Committee Gov. Davis and FERC will testify before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee on Wednesday and the House Financial Services Committee joins the fray with a hearing on the California energy situation on Wednesday. The latter committee will probably base its jurisdiction over some aspect of energy policy on a number of factors including its jurisdiction over presidential economic emergency powers. The committee staff has in the past expressed interest in derivatives and other financial aspects of energy trading and markets. We are checking now to quietly determine whether these issues will be on Wednesday's agenda.

We as part of a group of Northwest IOUS are exploring the possibility of retaining former Montana Governor Racicot to work BPA issues on our behalf. PGE will continue with Mike Andrews as our lobbyist but Racicot would work for the IOUs as a group. Does this cause you any concerns? Incidentally we may step up our efforts somewhat in the general area of BPA because of the situation out here. Please let me know if I or Mike should be coordinating what we do with any of your folks in DC. 2. One of the major Northwest issues is who will be the next BPA Administrator. For a variety of reasons there really aren't any good candidates from the Northwest and we're probably all to close to the situation anyway. I was wondering if the Enron net could come up with any good ideas for someone with good energy and policy experience from outside the Northwest? Someone who would appeal to the Bush administration? 3. With the delay in closing our sale to Sierra we would very much like the ability to use Enron Online for trading. I believe we can get the regulatory approvals necessary but apparently when we raised this some months ago there was strong opposition from within Enron particularly Joe Hartsoe. Do you see an issue with pursuing this? How do you suggest I move this forward? Thanks Steve. As you may hear from time to time things are going well here in Oregon. We are proceeding on our restructuring which is beginning to get notice from NARUC and others as a possible model for states that have not yet proceeded. It's an interesting world. I look forward to hearing from you.

Subject:: Knowledge Management Meeting
Body:: calendar. Also I would like you to set up a meeting with me Cindy Olson Beth Tilney Kelly Kimberly Mark koenig Rick Causey and Rick Buy. I was thinking the easiest way to get us all together would be to get a room at a restaurant for 6 or 6:30 some evening. I have contacted Beth and Cindy already so they know what it is about and I will leave messages for the others. I just need to check schedules for now. Also I think it would be a good idea to have a get together after work once a month or so for the Public Affairs organization. Nothing fancy . . . Cadillac Bar or something similar. . . spouses and significant others invited. Talk it over with a couple of people in the group and let me know what you come up with. -----------------

Subject:: Re: EES - RAC Deal Approval Meeting
Body:: I understood the validation process to be a fairly flexible name applied to a wide variety of approaches. What we specifically discussed and what scott s. left prepared and committed to do involved looking at individual curves the assumptions underlying them and some process (yet to be specifically determined) for addressing updates. We agreed to start with the top 20 curves and especially those which are involved in the upcoming deals. I think the confusion is in what the term validation means. In the ENA context it means one thing in this context it means what we discussed (which was in Jim's memo and as you'll recall we went through point-by-point). Let's just get this done. -----------------

Subject:: Next NERC Reliability Meeting on Legislation -- August 9th
Body:: See NERC memo below that was just received. They have scheduled what they hope will be the final meeting to resolve the reliability legislation next week -- August 9th. Of course this is awfully presumptuous in that it assumes that the model to be worked off of is the NERC model (even the shortened one) and not the PJM model that others prefer to use. We need to decide whether we suggest any changes to the shortened NERC version even those we know they would not take just to show a willingness to offer specific comments as we promised at the last meeting or simply agree to disagree. -----------------

Subject:: Re: Price Cap Media--DRAFT
Body:: I agree with Mona: we need to include some customer contacts . . . it gives them an opportunity to look smart about going to the marketplace and getting price protection. The messages need to include Palmer's top three: 1) price caps cause shortages (Rob- can you put together soe historical examples?) 2) better solutions are already available and 3) short term politics makes for long term problems. On item 2) we need to talk about the competitive offerings to San Diego the fixed price offerings available at retail and the availability of conservation and demand side management technology today (including its availability to the consuming public from existing suppliers . . . ie you don't need to wait for Enron to make a consumer offering). Mona L Petrochko 07/18/2000 01:26 PM To: Jeff Dasovich/SFO/EES@EES cc: James D Steffes/HOU/EES@EES Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES Mark Palmer@EES Richard Shapiro/HOU/EES@EES Paul Kaufman@EES Peggy Mahoney/HOU/EES@EES Karen Denne/Corp/Enron@Enron Jeff Brown/HOU/EES@EES Susan J Mara/SFO/EES@EES Sandra McCubbin/SFO/EES@EES Subject: Re: Price Cap Media--DRAFT I have a couple of suggestions on parts of the draft. Media Action: In addition to doing behind the scenes editorial board meetings and the like I would suggest that we get our coalition lined up and ready to release statements for certain key events which are likely to occur over the next several weeks such as: 1. SDG&E's selection of the winning bid to their RFP. Even if Enron isn't selected as the winning bid the coalition should trumpet the market-based solution and the enormous market response to SDG&E's RFP. 2. The Commission vote on UCAN's Emergency Motion. We should be prepared to issue a statement whether the Cmmn votes with us or against us. With us the market can and did provide reasonable expedient solutions to SDG&E's customers and protection from price spikes. Against us despite the overwhelming market response the Cmmn chose to ignore the market solutions and impose more regulation. 3. Potential for ARM members to surface a Provider of Last Resort proposal within the next couple of weeks. 4. ISO Bd. Mtg-keep up pressure against reducing price caps. Coalition Members: Agree that those groups listed should be contacted although the CMA CRA CIU CLECA have been luke-warm in their advocacy. I would add our customers (UC/CSU (especially the San Diego branch) PacTel etc.) NewEnergy has indicated that Kroger/Ralph's grocery stores San Diego-based would give testimonials. I could solicit the members of ARM to identify a key customer contacts for interviews. We could check with our lobbyists and see who they would recommend (wine growers dairy industry etc.) We should also consider the water agencies and the rural counties and the City of Pittsburg. While the immediate message is responding to San Diego's situation this latter group of potential coalition members would go to the larger message (keeping benefits of competitive markets) from a state-wide perspective. What about the City of Pittsburg?

Subject:: Re: PJM RTO Order
Body:: Great summary. I think the two main issues you raise are the right ones but I have one other thought we should discuss internally. Do we want to create a set of incentives for the management of PJM that would entitle management to incentive compensation to the extent they meet certain goals -- eg relieving congestion on the grid increasing throughput across the transmission system expediting interconnection (measured in terms of actual interconnections not just applications approved) etc. This way we could create an organization that would have the incentive to make a workable and open transmission system.

While it is somewhat lengthy the order has a lot of good information in it that I wanted to share with the group particularly the Commission's statements regarding the existing configuration of the northeast and the need to expand it. We are working on summaries of the New York and New England RTO orders and will have those out shortly. If you would like copies of the orders just let us know. We expect the mediation proceeding to begin within the next week. We will keep you updated. Sarah

Subject:: EPSA Meeting Today On Barton RTO Draft
Body:: The EPSA Leg. Affairs Committee is having a special meeting this afternoon (out of the normal biweekly cycle) to discuss how EPSA should respond to the Barton RTO discussion draft. In addition to the e-mail yesterday morning I spoke in person with Gene Peters of the EPSA staff to convey our strongly held view that mere technical corrections were not enough to fix the Barton RTO proposal as the EPSA draft letter stated. Gene came around because in a subsequent meeting we had with Rep. Chip Pickering (R-MS) a member of the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee Gene said that silence would be better than what is in the Barton draft. He did indicate to me (not to Pickering) that some EPSA members without naming them didn't want to come down too hard on Barton because in their view the draft could have been worse. These unnamed companies (or company?) claim to have told of earlier versions not released that would have been more restrictive on FERC's discretion. Some companies also think FERC could wiggle out of the strictures of the draft. I told Gene that there is no way to wiggle out of the definitions of minimum size/scope that FERC would be forced to accept and the various procedural advantages for recalcitrant utilities. While I am checking with counterparts at other EPSA members in advance of the afternoon meeting you might want to do the same as you speak with contacts at other EPSA members. I am confident we can get the EPSA letter to better reflect our position -- my suspicion is that the unnamed company Gene referred to is Reliant but I can't prove it. John

Subject:: Re: Enrons PaineWebber Service
Body:: Thanks for getting on top of this. Please get the word out to the HR team leaders as soon as you know more. From: Aaron Brown/ENRON@enronXgate on 07/13/2001 11:36 AM To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron Mary Joyce/ENRON@enronXgate cc: Subject: Enron's PaineWebber Service Rocky Emery the Dowd family Kim Bowden and another 15 or so employees of UBSPaineWebber (our stock tracking provider...options restricted stock etc) left yesterday evening without any warning. They went to 1st Union. I've set up a meeting at 2pm today for us to go over to UBSPW and make sure they understand the special needs of Enron and to make sure our service will not be affected. I am reviewing the contract in place between PW and Enron to understand the affects of this move by Emery and his staff on the agreement. Also I'm going to see about getting 2 providers of the stock tracking service from the following list: (in case this happens again we'll have a solid back-up immediately) UBSPaineWEbber (our current provider) 1st Union (where Rocky Emery went) Solomon Smith Barney (way ahead of the competition from a technology standpoint...and has done the two provider thing before) Prudential (another option with internal connections) let me know if you think I should include any others or would like to discuss. Thanks Aaron
