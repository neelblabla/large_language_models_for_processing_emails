Amy is correct in the fact that EBS is not likely to buy the software Strategy that provides a strategic top-down focus on competitive intelligence. However EBS is doing tactical competitive analysis and market research. We are providing the business units with the information that they need to make intelligent decisions at the business unit level. Amy's view is that competitive intelligence (CI) belongs at the corporate level and that CI should drive the strategic direction of the company. You and I both know this is not the way Enron operates. I hope this e:mail does not sound negative but I did want you to know that EBS is providing information and intelligence to its business units -- it is just not in the context that Amy thinks it should be in.

The EEF is an international leadership exchange program that promotes international understanding and productivity through the exchange of information ideas and perspectives among emerging leaders throughout the world. Ken Lay is a member of the EEF Board of Trustees. Enron will be hosting three EEF visitors from India on Wednesday October 18 2000: Mr. Sanjeev Ahluwalia Secretary of the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission Mr. Sreenivasan Jain Newscaster New Delhi TV and Mr. Jawed Usmani Joint Secretary Office of the Prime Minister. I am preparing a day program at Enron for the three persons two of whom - Sanjeev Ahluwalia and Jawed Usmani - are interested in learning more about the US regulatory environment. Mr. Ahluwalia also wants to learn more about US environmental policy in both local and global contexts (please refer to attached bios for more details). I would be grateful if either Steve or Jim could meet with the above persons for 30-45 minutes to discuss regulatory issues. Similarly if Mike could be available to meet with Mr. Ahluwalia re environmental issues.

At a minimum that language should be expanded to include another entity like an EISB. Similarly the language should probably be tweaked to allow FERC to adopt standards of an organization other than NERC.

The problem is this: Regardless of what the MOU says we will have to go through a size/probability analysis on this deal. The deal is clearly material to EOTT. From an SEC perspective the duty to disclose a pending deal depends upon how material the transaction is and how likely it is to occur. If a deal is very material a lower degree of probability is needed before disclosure is required. The MOU itself is not totally determinative although signing a document which looks like an LOI will increase the chances of having to disclose. In the present case if Equilon's Board gives the go- ahead to deal with us exclusively I feel there would be at least a 20% chance of closing a transaction (based upon past dealings with these folks). Accordingly if/when that happens we will need to take a hard look at the disclosure issue. We do not want to disclose prematurely but I am pretty sure that this deal would be considered material and if we go forward with Equilon I believe that we will need to disclose it at some point prior to closing (certainly after signing a PSA). We can delay disclosure for a period of time for legitimate business reasons and the MOU we sign may not rise to the level of an LOI but at some point---if we go forward with Equilon---we are going to reach a point where the size and probability of the deal will mandate disclosure. We don't need to make a decision at this point we just need to be aware of these circumstances and manage the process accordingly. From a different perspective we want to sign some kind of LOI with Equilon as soon as we feel comfortable doing so because we want the HSR waiting period to begin running. Equilon wants to close by November 1st. Please advise if you wish to discuss further. Thanks.

I would rather not disclose a tentative deal. Stan From: Steve Duffy@EOTT on 07/11/2000 01:47 PM To: Dana Gibbs Lori Maddox/Houston/Eott@Eott Stanley Horton/Corp/Enron@Enron cc: Joe Richards rbaird@velaw.com Susan Ralph Subject: Phoenix/Equilon Deal CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY/CLIENT COMMUNICATION AND ATTORNEY'S WORK PRODUCT Joe R. will be sending out something in greater detail shortly but it appears that Equilon's management would like to pursue a deal with us on an exclusive basis and that this decision is being forwarded to the Equilon Board for approval. If this acquisition goes forward we will need to get organized---in the near term---on a number of logistical/due diligence tasks but one thing we should start thinking about now is the disclosure issue. If the Equilon Board gives the go-ahead for Equilon to pursue this transaction  Equilon will probably want to sign a memorandum of understanding with us and this may put us in a disclosure posture because at that point we would be looking at a $65 million deal (approx.) with a closure probability of no less than 20% (in my judgment based upon our past dealings with these people). Even without a signed document the size/probability test would still be an issue for us to deal with. Everyone should be thinking about this issue as we await word from Equilon's Board. Thanks.

Affairs Committee is having a special meeting this afternoon (out of the normal biweekly cycle) to discuss how EPSA should respond to the Barton RTO discussion draft. In addition to the e-mail yesterday morning I spoke in person with Gene Peters of the EPSA staff to convey our strongly held view that mere technical corrections were not enough to fix the Barton RTO proposal as the EPSA draft letter stated. Gene came around because in a subsequent meeting we had with Rep. Chip Pickering (R-MS) a member of the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee Gene said that silence would be better than what is in the Barton draft. He did indicate to me (not to Pickering) that some EPSA members without naming them didn't want to come down too hard on Barton because in their view the draft could have been worse. These unnamed companies (or company?) claim to have told of earlier versions not released that would have been more restrictive on FERC's discretion. Some companies also think FERC could wiggle out of the strictures of the draft. I told Gene that there is no way to wiggle out of the definitions of minimum size/scope that FERC would be forced to accept and the various procedural advantages for recalcitrant utilities. While I am checking with counterparts at other EPSA members in advance of the afternoon meeting you might want to do the same as you speak with contacts at other EPSA members. I am confident we can get the EPSA letter to better reflect our position -- my suspicion is that the unnamed company Gene referred to is Reliant but I can't prove it.

But while the (otherwise perishable) thoughts are still fresh in my mind from the hearings on Monday and Tuesday I wanted to throw out some observations for discussion in the days/weeks ahead. OBSERVATION--The pressure to finger somebody for price gouging is increasing. The administration is hell bent on finding a fall guy. The price spikes pose real political risks for Davis and he and his folks need and want an easy way out. His press release following the hearing renewed the call for refunds. On my panel Loretta Lynch asked Reliant and Duke to supply her with the details of the contracts they cut to sell their power forward to marketers. And Carl Wood's remarks were extreme. At the Barton hearing a liberal democrat (Filner) and a conservative Republican (Hunter) locked arms in calling for refunds. Bilbray joined the gouging band wagon. The utilities repeatedly called on FERC to do a real investigation with hearings testimony data discovery---the works. On the positive side the FERC commissioners lauded Wolak his analysis and his remarks on the panel. Wolak said somewhat emphatically that the nature of California's market structure makes it impossible to single out a single participant as the culprit. He also stated that just everyone's just acting in their own self-interest responding to the screwed incentives embedded in the structure. IMPLICATION--It seems prudent for Enron to understand better its risks of getting fingered. In the best case the clamoring for a refund subsides. In which case the only cost to Enron is the internal cost incurred to understand better the risks of getting fingered. In the medium case investigations find that Enron (like others) played by the rules but the rules stunk and Enron profited at the expense of California consumers.

Recently Chris Calger has asked me to set up a meeting with Sempra. ENA's seeking deals with the two big CA gas IOUs (PG&E and SoCalGas) that would give ENA access to their assets. In short ENA wants to offer a complete outsource deal for the IOUs' core gas load (i.e. rez and small commercial customers). ENA would take responsibility for providing service for delivery at the city gate and in return would manage all of core's assets (upstream of the city gate). We're meeting with Sempra's Chief Regulatory Office (Bill Reed) and Sempra's CFO next Thursday to discuss. Given the fact that Sempra's primarily focused on electricity the plan is to lead off the meeting with a couple of electricity solutions as a bridge to the gas offer. For electricity the plan has two pieces: 1) a commodity offer that beats the 6.5 cent cap (i.e. nothing fancy) and 2) Deal Bench services with the intent of establishing a procurement mechanism for SDG&E that the California PUC could pre-approve (thereby eliminating some of the immense regulatory risk SDG&E now faces). Wanted to run this by folks to gauge reactions. We'll distribute the slides we're putting together as soon as they're drafted--hopefully by COB Friday.

Highlights and analysis are as follows: 1. Sen. Feinstein the chief sponsor of Senate price cap legislation called FERC's order a giant step forward and said she is very grateful for what the commission did. Senators Gordon Smith and Barbara Boxer agreed. Sen. Feinstein said that she and Sen. Smith would now recommend to Chairman Bingaman that next week's mark up of their price control bill be postponed for the time being pending how the order plays out in practice. Chairman Bingaman said he would follow their advice and cancel next week's mark up. (Responding to a question each of the five commissioners said that Congress should NOT act to pass Smith/Feinstein at least at this time -- this included Comr. Massey who has favored legislation in the absence of stronger action by the commission.) 2. However it is very important to point out that House Democrats in California and elsewhere out West have not been as supportive of FERC's order as have the Senators. House Democrats are still expected to attempt to offer a price control amendment to the supplemental appropriations bill when it comes before the House later this week. Of course the reaction of the Senate may undercut the House Democrats's argument at least at this time. Furthermore should prices go up and the FERC order is seen as not working price control advocates including Sens. Feinstein Smith and Boxer will no doubt pick up where they left off. 3. It will be very interesting to see how Senator Lieberman and Gov. Davis react to the FERC order at the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee hearing tomorrow morning. While this committee does NOT have legislative jurisdiction over the Feinstein/Smith legislation this hearing will be well covered by the news media. Sen. Lieberman is a cosponsor of the Feinstein/Smith legislation. 4. In my view the political and public pressure will now shift in large part -- at least for the time being -- from the legislative price cap proposals to the settlement conference process that the FERC order will set motion. There was a clear drum beat at the hearing from the western senators particularly Feinstein Boxer and Cantwell (WA) for refunds either out of the settlement conference or ordered by FERC. In essence they are pressing to have the price mitigation formula in the new order applied to power sales that took place prior to the issuance of the order. 5. Another sense of the poltiical flavor is that Sen. Schumer (D-NY) while expressing his continued support for deregulatioin and competition pressed FERC general counsel Kevin Madden (by this point the commissioners left for the RTO conference) about why the order applied only to the WSCC and did not apply nationwide. Madden at least tried to distinguish the New York and California markets but then said that Con Ed has filed pleadings with FERC to extend price mitigation to New York and he could not say any more about the matter. 6. Ranking Republican Frank Murkowski said he had received a letter today from four western governors -- those from Arizona North Dakota Utah and Wyoming -- saying that since FERC has acted there is no need for Congress to pursue price control legislation. There were a series of questions and comments on details and technical aspects of the orders. I will do an e-mail on these items later today. Please advise if you have any questions or comments.

My friend = Ol=0F' Dave in Houston has trouble understanding the workings of our power business here in California. In fact so do I. Yesterday=0F's Joint Senate/Assembly Committee on Energy and Natural Resources did nothing to improve either Dave=0F's or my understanding of the national embarrassment California is perpetrating with electricity deregulation. =0FThe next thing you know they will be taking property and forcing utilities to build power plants and transmission=0F he mused between sips of Dixie longneck beer and chomps of jalapeno peppers. =0FCome to think of it Dave they did say something about that. Yeah=0F I recalled =0FSenator Peace was expounding on his favorite idea which is forcing the ISO or the utilities to build peakers and not let the market build them. I can=0F't remember if that was before or after he suggested to EOB Chairman Kahn that the ISO and the PX should be folded into State agencies under the direction of the Electric Oversight Board.=0F I know what you are thinking right now. The next thing you know California will have regulated retail rates. That recipe should be out of the PUC=0F's oven sometime next week. =0FWell the power marketers are jigging the system bidding up to the ISO=0F's bid cap. There is no way you can tell me that a generator planned to make $750/MWH in its pro forma=0F Dave added. =0FSo you agree with Herr (Hair) Peace! You don=0F't believe in markets=0F I retorted. = =0FOh I believe in them but I remember when I was short on a 300 MW trade and without any notice or advanced warning the price in the Midwest market went against me=0F Dave recalled. =0FI called everyone who I tra= ded with and they had nothing. I finally called XXXXX and I asked what will it cost for 50 MW?=0F =0FWhy didn=0F't you ask for 300?=0F I wondered. =0FI didn=0F't want to= show him my position. You get hosed when you show the buyer your position. Ask for 50 first=0F Dave chided. =0FWhat happened?=0F =0FOh they offered to sell for $150/MWH. I said I= =0F'd take it and then said I needed another fifty. He asked $300. I took that and he priced the next 50 MW at $600=0F lamented Dave. =0FHe just wanted to see how far he could push me. That=0F's what I mean when I say the traders are jigging it.=0F =0FBut Dave you old communist your forgetting the trading function is what mitigates the risk. The traders are the in between people who guess at the price. Sometimes they guess right and sometimes they guess wrong. But the damage or the reward is on their book not passed on to the ultimate consumer. It has nothing to do with the marginal cost of a generating plant.=0F And there you have it. Put in a price cap and the traders have a target for which to shoot. I can=0F't prove the following yet but I=0F'l= l wager with any of you that as the price cap level dips down the average trading price climbs even as the so-called =0Fdysfunctional=0F price spik= es are eliminated. Consumers get hosed and the fundamental economic principle is upheld which is one can never be made better off with the imposition of an additional constraint. I feel better already. Here is what is on our short agenda this week. >>> Things in the Mailbag >>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings @@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market >>> Odds & Ends (_!_) >>> Things in the Mailbag It has been awhile since we put the mail feedbag on and had a munch. Here is what my friends have been writing me. FPL Energy=0F's Steve Ponder was only too quick to tell me =0FPlease Gary=  no more whining about your computer. How old are you?? Is this the year you get the AARP letter??? A very depressing moment. Do you really not know how to spell Morro Bay??? Please let us know what is going on with your son's hockey team?? Don't forget the cigars for Moron??? Bay!!!!=0F It is good to have friends like Steve. They make the pain of separation so much easier. And Steve when you FPL guys get that Entergy merger sorted out in a dozen years or so you let us know. I want to participate in the name selection for the new entity. How about Fentergy PLus? Next from the PX=0F's Mark Hoppe who writes =0FAs you've heard from others I don't know quite how you manage to knock out all this material each week. The burrito is informative humorous and usually contains a sprinkle of irony tragedy (ISO Drama). Though you are usually neutral regarding the PX you are not unduly negative which I appreciate. I think we do a pretty good job over here and so often people in the industry forget the amount effort and challenge it took the PX to successfully open this market.=0F Thanks Mark. I just want you to know that my ability to write this stuff every week is not constrained by the facts or evidence. I have learned from watching Herr (Hair?) Peace that as long as you can talk (write too) fast and have conviction in your statements regardless of how groundless they may be you will have a willing and eager audience. A few weeks ago I received from the PX=0F's Jennifer Sherwood a note which she wants you to know are her opinions not necessarily the PX=0F's. It=0F's okay Jennifer. I paid Georgeyesterday the $20 I owed him for that sham Rose Bowl bet (remember? Stanford lost) and your opinions are cool with us. =0FJust curious - has anyone been comparing high unleaded prices to high CA electricity prices? What I mean is we are up in arms about how we should protect the unfortunate San Diego consumer who can't afford to keep the AC on. But what about the inflated unleaded gas prices the whole country has seen over the last few months? No effort is made by the government to shield the consumer from how much it costs to fill their gas tank. No mention is made of those who can't afford to drive to the grocery store because they can't afford the extra 15 or 20 cents a gallon. The costs are passed along to the consumer without pause. Granted there are differences between the unleaded market and the electricity market in terms of demand-side responsiveness but then again is it that much different to say =0F`I can't drive today because gas is too expensive=0F' vs. =0F`I can't turn up the AC today because it's too expensive.=0F'=0F Finally from one of our [secret] Washington readers and I am not telling who I received the following: =0FI ... broke down and listened to the [ISO Governing Board] discussion and vote. Ugh! I too noted that the speak fast was applied to everyone but Herr Peace. My goodness what a mess we have. I loved Jerry's picture in USA Today -- it spoke volumes. My sources at FERC tell me though that we should keep an eye out for {FERC Chairman] Hoecker to do something really ... [Censored] ... for political reasons. Given no Commission meetings til September the only way to act is by unanimous consent so I would hope he can't do all that much.=0F >>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report Several of you people commented to me that the ISO=0F's reply to the PUC/EOB report was very good. I decided to excerpt the best sections of it for the Burrito. The full document can be found on the ISO=0F's website. =0F... the [PUC/EOB] Report asserts that the suspected activities of certain generators on June 13 created frequency instability leading to the Bay Area blackouts the following day. In fact the events of June 13 and June 14 were completely independent of one another. The voltage instability on June 14 was caused by system conditions on that day alone -- exceptionally high loads insufficient generation in the specific local area and transmission constraints that prevented the import of generation from outside the area. =0FThe Report states that the ISO =0Fnever tried=0F to call upon consume= rs to reduce demand in order to avoid the Bay Area blackouts. In fact the ISO had in place on June 14 a number of demand response programs designed to reduce load including the Summer 2000 Demand Response Program under which customers have agreed through a prior solicitation to curtail energy use in exchange for a fee =0FThe Report makes a number of assertions concerning the prices paid by =0F`purchasers=0F' of energy as a result of the recent price spikes (e.g. $= 1.2 billion in the month of June alone). These assertions leave one with the mistaken impression that these prices reflect amounts actually paid by the UDCs and/or passed through to customers. However in determining the total cost of energy one must determine the impact of any forward contracts entered into by the UDCs in advance of the wholesale energy markets. These contracts which are designed to =0Flock-in=0F a specific price in advance of real-time or near real-time market activities are specifically designed to mitigate the impact of price volatility and are standard in all commodities markets. We have reason to believe that some of the UDCs were substantially hedged during the period of the recent price spikes. =0FIn a similar vein the reports asserts that California =0Fmight well= =0F have saved $110 million dollars had a $250 price cap been in place in May and June. This assertion assumes that all energy purchases would have been made at or below the $250 bid cap. In fact during times of peak demand when all of the state=0F's generation has been exhausted the ISO competes with neighboring regions for available generation. In order to secure the necessary power the ISO must purchase on a bilateral basis this energy from resources located outside of the ISO=0F's control area. =0FThe Report asserts that California power markets =0Fare not now competitive=0F and implies erroneously in our view that this is the normal state of affairs. It is not. The Market Surveillance Committee has noted that =0Fmarket power in the California energy market appears to arise primarily during periods of peak demand=0F and warned that demand growth would increase the incidence of market power during the summer of 2000. =0FThe Report asserts that the ISO is answerable only to a self-interested board and not to the citizens of California. This simply is not the case. The ISO is subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act and to the rules and regulations of FERC which dictate in part that wholesale energy rates must be just and reasonable and in the public interest. The ISO further operates under a detailed tariff reviewed and approved by FERC. Every change to our market design and virtually every aspect of the ISO=0F's business is subject to review and scrutiny by FERC. The FERC process provides substantial opportunities for input by the state agencies and such agencies have in fact been active participants in the FERC proceedings. =0FThe Report asserts that California supply conditions have been affected by restructuring and that somehow the restructuring choices have made California more vulnerable to supply shortages. This assertion is unfounded. Significant load growth in California and neighboring states coupled with a lack of significant infrastructure investment in both generation and transmission have caused this vulnerability. Restructuring has increased proposed power plant applications many fold. Only by immediate and sustained attention to streamlining approval and siting processes for both of these critical infrastructure elements will this significant shortage be addressed.=0F >>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings If you want to imagine a scary sight imagine then twelve California legislators gathering together in one hearing room to rectify the wrongs of electric restructuring. Also imagine as if you are in the Twilight Zone witnesses that are slow on their feet and reckless in their facts. Then you get a glimpse of what yesterday=0F's Joint Senate/Assembly hearing was like. It started over two hours late. The Senate was busy congratulating one of their own who is term-limited out next session and they wanted to heap on the glory. That said the show began with CEC Commissioner Bill Keese. Mr. Keese has one story and regardless how well he tells it and he does it is always the same story. It is the heat storm story. One can imagine in the heat storm story a lead character who is a single-mom call her Lady-Bird Bowen who travels across an angry land with her precocious pre-teen child Stevie Wonderboy. They are searching for electric power plants in the dessert which by the grace of God have been shipped to other countries which have more liberal returns on investment. Being the first speaker Mr. Keese took at least half the heat (storm) of the day. The rage of the Energy Fuhrer was palpable. Last week San Diegans shed 350 MW of load last week to save the entire system and did not receive one penny of compensation (I=0F'm not making that up ... He said it). He is sick of hearing about demand management as being a solution for the problem over the last five years and he is about done listening. People in San Diego are depressed by the sudden price hikes. Yikes! Keese did mention that the California reserve margin has sunk to 7% but in neighboring Arizona the reserve margin is -1% or -2%!! Mr. Keese correctly pointed out that electric power is not solely a California problem it is a regional problem. One member of the Committee asked what the legislature could do to speed up the power plant siting and construction process? Keese referred to Governor Gray Davis=0F' Executive Order issued last week to which the CEC plans to respond soon date uncertain that lays out a 6 month permitting time line. The six months are enough if the applicant has the land secured zoning okayed transmission access and air offsets. Hmmmmmm. That alone might take six months before you get to the CEC. The next panel included Mr. Kahn of the EOB and Ms. Lynch. I went too hard on her last week calling her Let=0F's Do Lynch. That was a 0.8 TPC. Sorry. I promise to be nicer starting now. The Energy Fuhrer instructed Ms. Lynch to use her authority to order SDG&E to divert the pass through of funds from the customers to the PX until the dysfunction of the market is cured. Put it in an escrow account. Ms Lynch promised to review this option at her August 21 PUC Meeting where she will enact SDG&E rate caps (told you). The star of the day I thought was FERC General Counsel Doug Smith. Mr. Smith comes to Sacramento. Isn=0F't that a switch? Mr. Smith came in place of Mr. Hoecker thank the Lord. Mr. Smith put into FERC-eese what these 12 legislators could not get through their heads any other way. The 12 angry legislators were looking for a way for FERC to declare the wholesale market as non-competitive and then ask the generators to give back the money they over collected. When can we do that? Mr. Smith answered as only a FERC attorney can answer. There is a process. It takes time. You must have evidence. FERC uses a three-part criteria for assessing whether or not market based rates are allowable. It=0F's based on market concentration and dominance not the existence of high prices. You would have to sue FERC in federal court and the best you could hope for is for FERC to reconsider its decision upon remand from the US Court of Appeals. Slowly the wind came out of the sails of the gang of 12. They were stumped. Herr (Hair?) Peace screamed couldn=0F't you Mr. Smith of FERC today use your authority to declare the markets non-competitive that generators who had market based rates have exercised market power and retro-actively implement a $250 rate cap across the Western region? Like a wheezing accordion Mr. Smith played back and forth the familiar strains of music like a solo street musician on the corner. Back and forth: the process the process the process. There have been times in the past I hated the process at FERC. Today I have a renewed respect for what process affords me and you ... Freedom from the tyranny of a mob. For the remainder of the hearing they focused on remedies that could be undertaken by the PUC. >>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California @@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market Well the official title is =0FOrder Instituting Investigation into the Functioning of the Wholesale Electric Market and Associated Impact on Retail Electric Rates in the Services Territory of San Diego Gas & Electric Company=0F. I like my title better. This Order or OII was issued at the last business meeting of the Commission on August 3. It calls for an investigation of the wholesale markets responses from the three UDCs and a pre-hearing conference in San Diego on August 29 at the San Diego Convention Center. Here are the questions the PUC wishes us to address: =0F=07 What bill payment options should be provided to assist residential a= nd small commercial customers? (What does this have to do with the functioning of the wholesale market?) =0F=07 Should SDG&E be authorized to participate in bilateral contracts or other supply procurement activities? How should the Commission assess reasonableness? Are SDG&E=0F's purchasing activities serving its customers on just and reasonable terms? =0F=07 What is SDG&E=0F's obligation to minimize energy costs for its curre= nt customers? =0F=07 How should the Commission Attorney General EOB ISO and PX coordinate to investigate wholesale market events behaviors and irregularities? How should state/federal concerns be addressed? =0F=07 What are the causes of the price increases? Are anticompeititve practices causing some of the price increases? Are there mechanisms the Commission can employ to make ratepayers whole? >>> Odds & Ends (_!_) As promised last week I have a message from our event coordinator Barb Ennis regarding the upcoming WPTF General Meeting on October 5 and 6.

Subject: The Brilliance of Women There were 11 people hanging onto a rope that came down from a helicopter. Ten were men and one was a woman. They all decided that one person should get off because if they didn't the rope would break and everyone would die. No one could decide who should go so finally the Woman gave a really touching speech saying how she would give up her life to save the others because women were used to giving up things for their husbands and children and giving in to men.

The 30+ page report is available on the home page of the CBO's web site at www.cbo.gov. I have quickly read through the summary and it is largely favorable. For example the summary says: Much of the blame for California's electricity crisis attaches to the state's restructuring plan -- but not to its objective electricity deregulation. (...) But deregulation itself did not fail rather it was never achieved. The restructuring plan did not remove sufficient barriers on both the supply and demand sides of the market to allow competition to work -- in part because it was not designed to. Even without restructuring California's electric utilities would have faced a difficult challenge in meeting the demand for power and holding down prices in 2000. Consequently wholesale electricity prices were higher than they probably would have been in either a traditionally regulated market or a more fully deregulated market. Long-term solutions to California's electricity problems will most likely require three changes: removing barriers to the addition of generating capacity eliminating bottlenecks in the electricity transmission system and removing regulatory restrictions on the sale of power throughout the broad western market. On the negative side the report summary does state that some generators may also have withheld supplies at certain times to boost prices even more and the plan's auction system for the spot market appears to have created strong incentives for suppliers to bid strategically in a way that raised wholesale prices.

Enron had made an original contribution to the library foundation back in 1998 totaling $250K over five years. I am working with Community Relations and A/A Recruiting to evaluate the latest request and to discuss where Enron may have interest or find leverage for our Government Affairs Recruiting or PR efforts. The Foundation is willing to work with us to establish whatever type of program(s) and/or participatory involvement we would like. We have discussed an Enron speaker series classroom lectures advisory committee seats and the likes. I have already had a chance to run this by Rick Shapiro and Rob Bradley. Although Rick was noncommittal regarding his team's time for speaking or lecturing he seemed supportive of the effort. Rob has already been participating in some speaking opportunities there and supported expanded efforts. What are your thoughts on contribution levels (another $250K was suggested by CR) and any specific program or relationship opportunities regarding the Library Center or School of Public Policy. Please grab me for quick conversation when you have time. Thanks. Mike [/INST] Category: Company Business, Strategy, etc.(elaborate in Section 3 [Topics])"

From your message I think there may be some miscommunication between your PR guys and us. We understood that your PR people wanted to reprint the Op-ed and redistribute it to as-yet-undetermined people along with various Enron material. They also wanted to post it on Enron's public web site. But your message seemed to indicate you just want to post the op-ed on your intranet - for educational use only for your internal folks. If this is correct we would have no problem with it. In fact we have posted the op-ed on the CERA web page - which is theoretically available to every Enron employee for internal use only. If you want you could just post a link to the CERA web site so your people could get direct access to all our research on the topic. If I misunderstood you and you do want to redistribute the piece to third-parties -- that is a much bigger issue because it involves our intellectual property and branding issues. Obviously we would need to talk some more about this. I hope this helps. On a somewhat-related note we are also getting sucked more and more into the California vortex and being asked to help in areas that are not our traditional business such as expert witness testimony and policy issues. While we are not afraid to take a point of view (as you know!) we must maintain a neutral and independent posture. This is sometimes a difficult path to navigate but we are exploring two areas that may also interest Enron: 1. We have examined Joskow and FERC's analysis on the price gouging issue and we believe there are several major flaws in their methodologies. We are considering how best to broadcast our assessment without impinging on our core business or becoming an expert witness. We think a workshop similar to the Monday event at CERAWeek could work where we would present our findings and issue a report. 2. We are also looking into the economic impact of power outages in the West - especially linked to the overall fragile state of the US economy. This would be a collaborative effort with a major economic forecasting firm or university. Again the reults would go to our clients but could be released to a wider audience and a workshop might help highlight the release. Please let us know if either topic would be of interest to Enron. We would need to raise funding from various clients to help underwrite the effort  but the work would be CERA's independent research and we would stand fully behind it. Hope all is well. ...Peter .

As I understand from my review of certain documents received from SCE in response to our data requests review of an Executive Summary prepared by George Phillips on the issue and from my conversation with him yesterday EES and EEMC as a result of some problems with their settlement system did indeed underreport customers' usage to the ISO during the time period claimed by SCE. This has I believe resulted in two separate (although interrelated) points of contention with SCE -- of which only one is the subject matter of its counterclaim. First the underreporting resulted in Unaccounted For Energy (UFE) charges to the market. In correspondence sent by SCE to EEMC and EES during the last quarter of 2001 it appears that SCE was calculating the cost to the market from the EES/EEMC underreporting by applying the hourly day ahead market clearing price to the individual hourly variances. This cost to the market is overestimated however as SCE failed to take into account the fact that the ISO nets underreported amounts against overreported accounts to get a net amount of underreporting. This underreported amount is then allocated to all providers of physical load within a service territory through the assessment of UFE charges. Thus whatever the ultimate cost was determined to be SCE would not be allocated the entire amount. Second the underreporting of usage to the ISO results according to SCE in SCE paying EES and EEMC a PX credit for energy they never purchased. This claim is separate and apart from what SCE claims EES/EEMC cost the market in the way of UFE charges. What SCE is saying is that it believes that EES and EEMC only purchased on behalf of their customers the amount of energy which they reported to the ISO. EES' and EEMC's customers actually used more than the amount which EES and EEMC reported. SCE calculated the PX credit based on the amount used not reported. It is SCE's claim that EES and EEMC are not entitled to a PX credit on the delta as the market not EES and EEMC purchased those volumes. It is only the second point of contention which is the subject matter of SCE's counterclaim. SCE is alleging that it should not have to pay a PX credit to EES and EEMC for volumes that EES and EEMC did not purchase. SCE is claiming that we only purchased the amount we reported to the ISO. While SCE may believe that it should not have to pay any UFE charges as the result of EES/EEMC underreporting the UFE charges are not the basis of its counterclaim. Based on the above analysis I think that the most critical piece of information to refute the counterclaim is that despite the underreporting of volumes to the ISO EES and EEMC actually purchased on behalf of their DA customers those customers' full usage. Can we make such claim? and do we have data to back it up? Jeanne Bennett [/INST] Category: Company Business, Strategy, etc.(elaborate in Section 3 [Topics])"

I'm testifying at the Congressional hearing and Dasovich is covering FERC. I think Jeff's comments were taken out of context. He said policymakers do need to take care of small customers whose bills are tripling. Frankly we'd get slaughtered if we said anything else. But he also said there is a right way and a wrong way to do it. Enron and others had provided a market based answer by offering a fixed price deal to SDG&E (which would have enabled them to cap rates to those who had not switched. California elected instead to cap rates and deficit spend (ie create a deferral account). I don't think we can stand for anything that doesn't protect the small customers but we can continue to emphasize the market based solutions. One of the messages in my testimony will be: customers should be encouraged to choose. Those who did are doing fine.

The vote was 50 to 5 to report the bill. Other committees -- Ways and Means Science and Resources -- also moved their energy bills this week. Thus the House is on track to consider a merged package before the start of the August Recess on August 3rd. As to electricity during the several days of debate this week both Chairmen Tauzin and Barton reaffirmed their intention to next move to electricity issues. Mr. Barton's staff advised me this morning that the subcommittee he chairs will hold a hearing on Friday July 20th on all electricity issues other than transmission. While Mr. Barton has publicly held out hope of marking up an electricity bill this month sources on and off the committee do not see this timetable as realistic. On the Senate side the majority staff is working on an electricity white paper that may be circulated for comment next week. Below is a recap of action on amendments of interest to Enron: 1. Last night on a largely partisan vote (with Democrats Hall Green and John voting with the Republicans) the Committee rejected an amendment by Rep. Jane Harman (D-CA) (that was to have been offered by Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA)) that would have retroactively amended the FERC refund date and essentially ordered refunds regardless of amounts owed to power sellers. 2. First thing this morning the Committee again on a largely partisan basis (with Democrats Hall Green John and Towns) rejected a Waxman amendment to impose cost-of-service rates on all power in the West (other than generation added after 1/1/01). (Originally Mr. Waxman was going to offer amendment to impose cost-of-service rates only on those who do not supply all available power during an emergency but he ended up offering basically what he had pursued in subcommittee on the old Californa Only bill.) 3. The Committee adopted an amendment by Rep. Shadegg to amend the Natural Gas Act to make it clear that a natural gas transportation facility shall not be added to the National Register of Historic Places until FERC has abandoned the facility. Apparently there have been some instances of old pipelines being considered as historic places under federal law. The House Resources Committee added a similar amendment to its package yesterday. 4. By voice vote the Committee rejected a Waxman Amendment to require the president to propose and implement a plan to bring U.S. greenhouse gases down to 1990 levels. There was strong opposition voiced by many Republicans and Democrats to this amendment. 5. By mixed vote of 24 to 29 the Committee defeated a Waxman Amendment to set cost and performance goals for renewables including wind power and authorize federal funds to assist with commercial project costs (up to 50 percent).

Admit it: The only comic re= lief in this energy crisis has been watching our leaders go at suppliers a= nd each other like pro wrestlers or Jerry Springer guests. In his St= ate of the State address last January Gov. Gray Davis accused the big pri= vate electric power generators of legalized highway robbery and threatened= to seize their plants if necessary. Then he really got angry calling the= m the biggest snakes in the world. This past week Atty. Gen.

Meanwhile = President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney have blamed California for c= ausing its own problems with a harebrained deregulation scheme and mocke= d the state's power purchases and conservation programs. It's been fun. No= w it's time for our leaders to act like adults. Davis and Bush alwa= ys will have their political differences but the economies of both the st= ate and the nation are endangered by California's energy situation. These = leaders need to work together as cooperatively as possible starting next = week when Bush makes his first visit to California as president. Da= vis wrote Bush Wednesday offering to meet with him during his California v= isit. Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said the president looks forward to dis= cussing energy and other issues. Good start. Let's hope the conversation i= s civil and that the civility spreads. No matter how much California= has been abused by the power companies and it absolutely has the state = still needs them to help solve the crisis caused by shortages of electric = power generation this year and next. Usually the biggest targets of offi= cial and public wrath are the investor-owned utilities such as Southern Ca= lifornia Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric Co. But not this time because = in the view of the state the utilities have been bled dry by the power ge= nerators' stratospheric prices. The state had to take over the purchase of= power when the generators refused to extend any more credit to Edison and= PG&E. Legal recourse should be pursued but the threatening rhetoric need= s to subside. State lawmakers are right to be upset with the White = House for refusing to use its authority to set reasonable temporary wholes= ale price controls.

In the Senate: The Senate bill 78XX is with about 90% likelihood going to be voted out of the Senate tonight---without a vote having taking place in any committee. Burton announced during one of the two informational hearings that this is it despite the view of just about everyone who appeared before the committees the bill likely won't prevent Edison from going bankrupt. The key features of the bill are: Banks and QFs get paid in full. Edison shareholders would be responsible for debts owed to suppliers No direct access. There are conflicting reports about whether the Senate will take up the bill tomorrow de-linking the bonds from the DWR contracts and whether the Republicans will go along with it. In the Assembly: The Committee is hearing the Wright and Hertzberg bills as we speak with Hertzberg's the likely winner. That bill now provides for Direct Access under certain conditions (the amendments describing the conditions were faxed today). We're attempting to get the July 12 date changed to the effective date of the bill or later. The Assembly likely won't vote the Hertzberg bill out until tomorrow at the earliest. The Problem: The Assembly and Senate bills are diametrically opposed in the way each approaches the problem---in short the bills are two ships passing in the night. The Democratic leaders (Governor Hertzberg Burton) aren't talking and Burton hasn't expressed any interest in talking---to anybody. The likely outcome given the circumstances: Burton says he's done what he needs to do (i.e. passed out a fair bill) the Assembly and Senate can't agree they finish the budget time runs out they leave Friday and Edison's left twisting. That said there's still a chance that the Governor could call Burton and sit down with Burton and Hertzberg and work something out by Friday or begin talking and postpone the recess until they get it worked out. But given Burton the chance of that happening seems very slim. In short little has changed since yesterday.

While we have not seen the text we are told that it is anti-RTO and may go so far as to state or imply that FERC does not have authority to do what is doing with RTOs. (We know this is the view of one of Chairman Tauzin's counsels who formerly worked for Southern Co.). Chairman Tauzin has been contacted by Entergy and the Louisiana Public Service Commission to send the letter. I spoke to Chairman Barton's staff Andy Black this afternoon and relayed our concerns. The Barton Subcommittee is now expected to mark up an electricity bill in December (per a Republican Member meeting held this morning). ACTION ITEM: Call Rep. Joe Barton (202/225-2002) TALKING POINTS: 1. Should start with something about the Dynegy/Enron transaction (it will be strange if Mr. Lay or Steve calls Chairman Barton and does not start the conversation with some reference to the transaction). 2. Mentioning the transaction naturally leads into the importance of competitive wholesale markets for power both for consumers and for the largely Texas-based marketing trading and merchant power industries. 3. We understand that Chairman Barton has been approached by Chairman Tauzin about a letter to FERC on the RTO issue. We know Chairman Barton is well aware of Enron's strong support for FERC's RTO initiatives. We respect Chairman Barton's interest in seeing to it that Congress does not abdicate its responsibility to make energy policy. 4. If as we have been lead to believe the letter states or implies that FERC does not have authority to act in the RTO arena this will be seen as a potentially destabilizing development since FERC is so far down the road of creating RTOs. 5. While we understand some in Congress and elsewhere were concerned that FERC was moving too fast as of the last FERC meeting earlier this month that is no longer true even if it ever was true. While we think RTOs should be created sooner rather than later FERC is listening to state regulators and others who had concerns. 6. A letter from congressional leaders questioning FERC's authority goes too far in the direction of those who oppose any RTOs. Furthermore it is wrong as a matter of law. The D.C. Circuit held in the gas cases and in the power cases on Order 888 that FERC has authority to address systemic discrimination which is in large part what the RTOs are all about -- a remedy for discrimination.

Davis seems to continue to put distance between himself and the contracts. Best Jeff Financial California Changes Stance on Refunds Two Sides Far Apart In Energy Talks Peter Behr 07/06/2001 The Washington Post FINAL Page E01 Copyright 2001 The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity  saying they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43 billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year. Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term contracts whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for Davis. We've made suggestions we've offered various ways in which people could get us $8.9 billion Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday. You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you want to do it it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion. The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr. according to sources close to the negotiations. Yesterday Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach a compromise. What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood Wagner told reporters. In the event we're unable to do that [Friday] at some point I may offer a preliminary assessment. The settlement conference is set to conclude on Monday. Wagner FERC's chief administrative judge has been trying to push both sides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy. Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California 's largest utility drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on. Last Friday Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative Michael Kahn chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in refunds from power generators and marketers was too high sources said. Wagner's settlement conference which has involved more than 100 lawyers for all sides is closed to the public and media. Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a joke that the parties might as well wear clown suits according to a Dow Jones report confirmed by sources close to the talks. But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers led by Reliant Energy Inc. Williams Energy Services Duke Energy and Southern Co. for failing to make serious settlement offers these sources said. The suppliers have offered to refund $600 million provided the state is able to call off various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds sources said. Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds but now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California 's electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher refund figure some energy analysts believe. Davis's tactical change offering to make the long-term contracts part of an overall settlement comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have to pay for energy under those deals. California 's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed deregulation plan which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at volatile spot market prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer so did the state's electricity bills. In response Davis's aide S. David Freeman and his staff began negotiating long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years. That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was paying at the beginning of this year but above current power prices -- and considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade energy analysts say. A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count as a refund because the deals were reached under commercial duress according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations. Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify. There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be said Michael Zenger California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a just and reasonable standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure. It's not rocket science but it does require the regulators to regulate said Frank Wolak a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight committee for the California grid. Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room billions of dollars apart as the talks approached their final weekend sources said.

There is an opportunity for Enron to participate with MEC in the early development of their company but it seems the one thing they want is the one thing we also want people. I would appreciate your thoughts and comments on the possiblity of creating a small team that could work directly with MEC as part of a potential investment and strategic relationship. Given our resource constraints this would most likely be part of the organization that sees the greatest strategic impact from MEC's development.
