Subject:: Barton Staff Meeting
Body:: Yesterday I spent about 45 minutes with the three key energy staff to the H= ouse Energy and Commerce Committee -- Andy Black (for Barton) and Sean Cunn= ingham and Jason Bentley (the energy counsels to the full committee). We m= et at my request to discuss Barton RTO draft. (The group EPSA meeting with= Chairman Barton that was to have been yesterday afternoon has been resched= uled for next Tuesday.) =20 Key points from the meeting -- =20 1. They do not expect the Barton Subcommittee to mark up the electricity l= egislation this year. Time is running out and Members of the subcommittee = are not focused on the issue. Instead, they plan to continue working on th= e issue at the staff level. Probably will be another draft version circula= ted and then a version will be introduced by Barton as a formal bill by the= end of the year. The earliest they see any kind of vote is late Jan. or ea= rly February. =20 2. Barton feels strongly that FERC should not be the ""tail wagging the do= g"" on RTO policy. =20 3. On particulars of the bill, they are clearly reconsidering the 40,000 = MW minimum threshold for the size of an RTO. They are getting pulled in bo= th directions, they say, and are inclined to drop the 40,000 MW number -- p= ossibly leaving it to FERC to set a number. They conceded that the mechani= cs of the draft make it unlikely that the 18 month ""deadline"" for all trans= mission owners to get into an approved RTO would stick. They consciously c= hanged the normal judicial standard of review for FERC actions from ""arbitr= ary and capricious"" to ""preponderance of the evidence"" because they think o= therwise the courts will rubber stamp FERC. Spent a lot of time on how the= draft would aid and abet the recalcitrant utilities and that the overall n= ature of the draft assumes there are only two parties to this -- FERC and t= he transmission owners -- while the rest of those truly affected -- from us= to others -- are left out. Sean said we could still intervene, but I said= that was the truly pro forma aspect of their process since FERC's hands an= d our's would be tied by the ""rights"" given to transmission owners to drag = their feet. =20 Bottom line -- FERC has a window until next Spring without likely congressi= onal interference, at least not of the formal, legislative variety, to both= move on RTOs and improve its relations with Congress. FERC staff has been= pushing the committee staff on concerns similar to our concerns.

However, the department, which has avoided PG&E Co.'s bankruptcy= =20 proceedings by claiming sovereign immunity, will not be controlled by the= =20 agreement. Montali pointed out that the department still could demand=20 reimbursement from PG&E.=20 Under the agreement, the ISO will not press any claims against PG&E on beha= lf=20 of generators if they are not paid.=20 The proposed preliminary injunction was based on an April order by the=20 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which forbade the ISO from purchasing= =20 power on behalf of any non-creditworthy buyer, such as PG&E.=20 The ISO is appealing the FERC order. If the appeal succeeds, the injunction= =20 will end.=20 Peter Schrag: Turning up the heat in Houston and Washington (Published June 6, 2001)=20 Behind all the palaver about the predictable standoff at last week's energy= =20 ""summit"" between President Bush and Gov. Gray Davis, one major political=20 development was missed.=20 Put simply, in the past month the focus of the California energy crisis, an= d=20 maybe the onus as well, has moved east: from the state's (and Davis')=20 handling of the mess to the generating companies, energy marketers and gas= =20 pipeline companies that have richly profited from it, and thus to FERC, the= =20 do-next-to-nothing Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and the Bush=20 administration.=20 That wasn't all Davis' doing -- far from it -- though it's been at the hear= t=20 of his message about energy industry ""pirates"" and ""profiteers."" Bush's=20 misbegotten energy plan and the administration's political clumsiness also= =20 contributed mightily, not least by inadvertently giving Davis the chance to= =20 get media exposure he could only have dreamed about.=20 More important, there's the defection of Sen. James Jeffords from the=20 Republican Party and the resulting shift of control in the U.S. Senate, whe= re=20 the next chair of the Energy Committee will be Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New=20 Mexico, a co-sponsor of Sen. Dianne Feinstein's bill capping wholesale=20 electric rates for the next two years. And chairing the Committee on=20 Governmental Affairs will be Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, who's=20 already asked for an audit of energy prices.=20 Those changes will draw a lot more attention to recent studies showing that= a=20 handful of big generators -- Duke Power, Reliant, Mirant, Dynegy and the hu= ge=20 energy-marketing firm Enron -- have gamed the market to drive wholesale=20 prices to levels that, in the year 2000, sometimes reached 40 times the=20 prices of the year before.=20 The findings come not merely from economists at the California Independent= =20 System Operator, the agency that manages the state's grid, who estimate=20 overcharges resulting from market power at $6.2 billion for last year alone= .=20 They come also from Severin Borenstein and his colleagues at the University= =20 of California Energy Institute, who ""conservatively"" calculate the=20 overcharges at $4.5 billion; from Paul Joskow, a widely respected energy=20 economist at MIT; and from Edward Kahn, an economic analyst in San Francisc= o.=20 In a recent paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research,=20 Joskow and Kahn conclude that there's ""considerable evidence that the high= =20 prices experienced in the summer of 2000 reflect the withholding of supplie= s=20 from the market by suppliers [generators or marketers] exercising market=20 power."" That those high prices occurred not merely during peak usage but al= so=20 at off-hours, when no one had ever seen a price spike before, makes those= =20 spikes even more curious.=20 There is, in addition, the powerful suspicion that the huge increase in=20 natural gas prices that a subsidiary of El Paso Energy Co., now the largest= =20 gas company on Earth, was charging on the California side of the=20 California-Arizona border wasn't merely the result of an innocent imbalance= =20 between supply and demand.=20 None of that may be illegal. If there's no collusion, there are no violatio= ns=20 of antitrust laws. But it adds plenty of steam to the political argument. I= n=20 the 2000 election cycle alone, energy companies kicked in some $64 million = in=20 political contributions, 75 percent of it to Republicans. At a time when=20 those companies, many of them located in the same Houston neighborhood, are= =20 racking up astronomical profits and when their collective coziness with Bus= h=20 and the Republican Party is a lot more than rhetoric, their vulnerability t= o=20 a vigorous Senate investigation ought to be obvious.=20 The clincher is ""Blackout,"" a ""Frontline"" program that both symbolizes the= =20 shifting emphasis and reinforces it. (The program is scheduled to be aired = at=20 8 p.m. Friday on Sacramento cable Channel 7.) It isn't another recital of= =20 Californians worrying about their electric bills, or about the stupidity of= =20 the state's deregulation scheme or how Davis dithered in addressing the=20 crisis. It is about those generators and marketers in Houston and North=20 Carolina, men (and a few women) who regard themselves as the heroes of the= =20 new energy markets.=20 The piece is reported by Lowell Bergman, who in working for both ""Frontline= ""=20 and the New York Times has already broken major print stories about Duke=20 Power's secret approach to Davis offering unspecified energy refunds in=20 return for an end to state investigations and lawsuits. Bergman also report= ed=20 private conversations between Enron chairman Kenneth Lay, a major Bush=20 supporter, and FERC chairman Curt Hebert regarding the influence that Lay= =20 could exercise with Bush to allow Hebert to keep his chairmanship if Hebert= 's=20 supported certain decisions Enron badly wants.=20 None of these recent events is likely to end Davis' political woes, and the= y=20 may not produce the wholesale rate caps Feinstein wants and that most=20 economists think necessary -- or maybe any significant reduction in the=20 industry's predatory pricing. But they will surely help turn up the heat,= =20 both in Houston and Washington.

Is trading an insider's game?=20 Buying, selling of electricity is a growth business, but some say deck is= =20 stacked against consumers By Craig D. Rose=20 UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER=20 June 6, 2001=20 While Californians decry deregulation's failure to deliver a competitive=20 market, electricity wholesalers have quietly developed a vast and rapidly= =20 growing business of buying and selling power among themselves.=20 The deals take place on high-tech trading floors in Houston and elsewhere= =20 around the country, as well as on Internet-based trading systems.=20 Some experts say this electricity trading is a key mechanism for raising=20 consumer power prices, yet it's largely unregulated.=20 ""Electricity trading is like buying stock -- when you have ability to chang= e=20 the stock price,"" said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economics profess= or=20 and member of the state grid operator's market surveillance group.=20 Energy companies say the buying and selling of contracts to deliver power= =20 provides risk management, allowing plant owners to presell their electricit= y,=20 lock in prices and avoid fluctuations. The rough and tumble of the free=20 market, they add, is the most efficient means of allocating a resource like= =20 electricity.=20 But industry critics say trading is far from a competitive market paradigm.= =20 In their view, it's a means of communication -- a way for energy insiders t= o=20 collude and raise prices under the guise of competition.=20 To be sure, the trading arms of major energy companies have emerged as star= s=20 in an industry where profit surges of 300 percent or 400 percent are not=20 uncommon.=20 The transactions, shrouded in secrecy, can leave ownership of a critical=20 commodity in unknown hands. Consider the case of power generated by AES=20 Corp.'s California plants.=20 In 1998, AES made a bold move. Immediately after purchasing power plants th= at=20 gave it control of 10 percent of the state's electric generating capacity,= =20 the company sold the output from its plants for the next 20 years to Willia= ms=20 Cos.=20 Williams did not sit on this treasure trove of electrons. The Tulsa, Okla.,= =20 company soon sold 80 percent of what it bought.=20 It is difficult to say who owns that power now. Some might be owned by Semp= ra=20 Trading, a sister company of SDG&E. Or some could be owned by Enron Corp.,= =20 the nation's biggest electricity trader.=20 A spokeswoman for Williams conceded that Williams itself may have repurchas= ed=20 some of the electricity it sold earlier. But trading companies closely guar= d=20 their positions.=20 This much can be said with certainty: Electricity that AES sold for less th= an=20 5 cents per kilowatt-hour to Williams changed hands perhaps 10 times in the= =20 wholesale market and emerged at times in recent months with a price tag for= =20 consumers that was 300 percent higher.=20 Williams' trading profits increased by 523 percent in the first quarter thi= s=20 year. Advance sales All this buying and selling creates curious confluences.=20 In their attempt to deflect criticism over high prices, generating companie= s=20 such as Duke Energy -- operator of the South Bay Power Plant in Chula and= =20 others in the state -- frequently note that they sell most of their=20 electricity far in advance. But they acknowledge less often that their=20 trading units may also be buying power, which could boost the company's=20 electricity inventory.=20 Duke was the fourth biggest electricity trader last year and cited its=20 trading activity as a prime contributor to its wholesale business profits,= =20 which soared 324 percent in the first quarter to $348 million.=20 It is a company's power traders who frequently direct plant operators to=20 increase or decrease the generation of power in response to market=20 conditions.=20 Energy companies have little option but to turn to trading for profits. One= =20 of the better kept secrets of electrical deregulation and its promise of=20 competition is that there is remarkably little competition in the productio= n=20 side of the business.=20 For one thing, electricity is a commodity; power from one company is=20 indistinguishable from that generated by others.=20 More important, nearly all modern plants generate power from turbines built= =20 by a handful of manufacturers. The result? Modern plants owned by different= =20 companies produce power at nearly identical cost.=20 ""The cost of power produced by modern plants is all within a mil=20 (one-thousandth of a dollar),"" said Michael Peevey, an adviser to Gov. Gray= =20 Davis and former president of Southern California Edison.=20 So the extraction of profit in the electricity business relies much more on= =20 trading. Traders' profits rise when prices are volatile -- plunging, or eve= n=20 better, rising sharply. Little regulation But despite the obvious temptation to manipulate the market, the burgeoning= =20 electricity trading business has remained largely unregulated.=20 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission does require quarterly filings fro= m=20 energy traders, but these often provide incomplete information, or at least= =20 little that has been of concern to FERC.=20 In fact, although the trading of electricity grew more than a hundredfold= =20 from 1996 to 2000, FERC has taken no major enforcement action against a=20 trader. After the onset of the California crisis last year, FERC has acted= =20 once. That was against Williams, which agreed to pay $8 million without=20 admitting guilt to resolve an allegation that it withheld supply to pump up= =20 prices.=20 FERC's record of enforcement in the area of power trading stands in contras= t=20 to a long list of enforcement actions within other markets taken by the=20 Securities Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission= .=20 FERC has recently added staff to its market oversight operations. But Willi= am=20 Massey, a FERC commissioner, says the agency's effort is still inadequate.= =20 ""Electricity can be flipped, stripped and chopped up,"" Massey said. ""It's a= n=20 extraordinarily complicated market.=20 ""The sophisticated marketers and traders have simply moved past us. We're= =20 kind of horse and buggy in our approach and they're out there in rocket shi= ps=20 flying around ... The problem is that sophisticated traders don't necessari= ly=20 produce reasonable prices. They produce profits.""=20 Before deregulation, electricity trading was a low-key affair. Regulated=20 utilities dealt power back and forth on a reciprocal basis to fill=20 electricity shortfalls in their control areas. There was little trading for= =20 profit until the mid-1990s, after federal legislation and FERC rulings open= ed=20 the market.=20 Major traders include large energy companies, sister companies of=20 California's major utilities and Wall Street firms. Market volatility In many ways, the trading of power is similar to that of other commodities.= =20 But there are important differences. Because it cannot be stored and its us= e=20 is so fundamental, the price of electricity is the most volatile of all.=20 When supplies are tight, a single supplier can rapidly raise prices to=20 budget-busting levels, as evidenced by Duke Energy's recent admission that = it=20 charged California nearly $4,000 for a megawatt-hour of power, a quantity= =20 that probably sold hours earlier for one-tenth of that sum or less.=20 Wolak, the Stanford economist, and state Sen. Joseph Dunn, D-Garden Grove,= =20 who is investigating the state power market, say trading allows companies t= o=20 collude under the guise of competition. Instead of wringing out lowest cost= s,=20 the wholesale trading market serves to raise prices, they say.=20 ""As I trade to you and you trade to me, we communicate to each other what= =20 price we would like to get,"" said Wolak. ""It's not collusive. It's just=20 communicating price.""=20 Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron, the nation's biggest power trader, said= =20 California's problem is not the result of trading.=20 ""It's a result of shortages,"" Palmer said.=20 Underscoring its emphasis on trading, Enron's new headquarters tower in=20 downtown Houston rises from a six-story block of new trading floors,=20 including expanded space for electricity trading.=20 Enron also pioneered trading in cyberspace and its Enron Online site claims= =20 to be the most active computer-based trading market.=20 The Houston company argues that consumers won't fully benefit from power=20 trading and deregulation until they have greater choice in choosing their= =20 power supplier. And the company says FERC has not done enough to open acces= s=20 to transmission lines, which would allow traders to move power around the= =20 country. To that end, Enron has lobbied hard for President Bush's plan for = a=20 national electricity grid.=20 Palmer says the notion that the price of electricity rises each time it is= =20 traded is mistaken.=20 ""The market is always looking for the real price of a commodity,"" Palmer=20 said.=20 Dunn, the California state senator, says his investigation found a differen= t=20 function for trading. At a time when supply barely meets or falls short of= =20 demand, he noted, companies with electricity to sell have to worry only abo= ut=20 how high to set their price.=20 ""The trader is a pawn in the generator's game to drive up prices,"" said Dun= n.=20 ""Trading develops a level of trust. You, my alleged competitor, will bid in= =20 the same patterns and I will respond not in a competitive pattern but in a= =20 complimentary pattern.""=20 The state senator said his investigation found evidence that on several day= s,=20 energy companies appeared to test their ability to drive prices up, without= =20 being undercut by competitors.=20 This ability to drive up prices without competitive consequence is a key te= st=20 of market power, the technical term for manipulation or price fixing.=20 But Dunn also conceded that antitrust violations can be hard to prove in=20 court. He suggested that even if the trading behavior falls short of=20 antitrust violations, it remains anti-competitive and devastating for the= =20 California economy.=20 To Harry Trebing, a utility industry expert and professor emeritus at=20 Michigan State University, wholesale electricity trading is reminiscent of= =20 what took place in the 1920s and early '30s. Back then, utility companies= =20 created complex networks of holding companies that traded stock among=20 themselves, driving up prices in the process.=20 Undoing that scheme was a focus of President Franklin Roosevelt's=20 administration. Congress ended up barring national power companies and=20 tightening regulation of utilities, in an effort to counteract their tenden= cy=20 to create markets that work only for insiders.=20 ""The broad goals of trading are the same,"" Trebing said.=20 ""The goal is to maximize profits through raising prices.""=20 Daily energy costs for state fall in past weeks=20 By Ed Mendel=20 UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER=20 June 6, 2001=20 SACRAMENTO -- In some of the first good news of the electricity crisis, the= =20 Davis administration said yesterday that the daily cost of power purchased = by=20 the state for utility customers has dropped in recent weeks.=20 The price-drop news comes after an announcement that Californians conserved= =20 more energy than expected last month, 11 percent, and amid Davis=20 administration optimism that the Legislature may finally begin to move on a= =20 plan to keep Southern California Edison out of bankruptcy.=20 The developments, if they turn out to be a trend and not temporary, could b= e=20 among the first signs that Gov.

Body:: Mike - perhaps you can help me or forward this on to someone who can. The people in my organization support all the Enron business units but many are specifically dedicated to certain business units. As a consequence, we have ended up on a variety of LANs with a variety of support people. Due to the fine efforts of your team, many people in my group have migrated over to the Enron Corp LAN. We are also now enjoying great support from Russell & Russell (Servat and Mitchell). As the IT guy, I'm sure you are accustomed to such profuse praise. However, many of the people on my team (including me) are on the EES LAN. Historically, EES has supported us with the equipment we need and they too have been doing a fine job in that regard. Historically, therefore, we have not budgeted for IT .... a practice which will change starting next year. In the meantime, when we sought to migrate the rest of my organization to the CORP LAN we were told that we would have to pay for all of our current equipment or give it back to EES. If you need me to, I can explain in detail why this makes no sense.

Gen. Bill Lockyer this week suggested the = chairman of a Houston-based power company should be locked in a prison cel= l with an amorous, tattooed inmate named Spike. Lockyer, who is inve= stigating whether energy firms have manipulated prices on the wholesale el= ectricity market, made the comment in an interview with the Wall Street Jo= urnal that appeared Tuesday. ""I would love to personally escort [En= ron Corp. Chairman Kenneth] Lay to an 8-by-10 cell that he could share wit= h a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi my name is Spike, honey,' "" Lockyer said. = Enron spokesman Mark Palmer called the comment ""counterproductive rh= etoric"" that ""does not merit a response."" But other industry repres= entatives denounced the remark as ""outrageous,"" especially because neither= Lockyer's office nor any investigative panel has filed charges against En= ron or other companies. ""You'd expect that the state's chief legal c= ounsel would file charges first and make public statements second,"" said G= ary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, an association of energy = producers and traders. ""We're very disappointed with his choice of words, = which don't exactly fit the profile of his office."" In an interview = Tuesday, Lockyer said he decided to ""ratchet up"" the commentary to ""put [e= nergy companies] on notice"" that ""we are not afraid of them and have the w= ill to prosecute."" ""What I'm trying to do is let these economic buc= caneers understand that if we catch them, they're going to be prosecuted,""= Lockyer said. ""Just because they're multimillionaires and run big corpora= tions, it doesn't provide them with immunity."" The attorney general = is investigating whether power company officials tried to maximize profits= through illegal manipulation of prices on the wholesale energy market. S= everal panels, including a state Senate committee and the California Publi= c Utilities Commission, are conducting similar probes. On Tuesday, L= ockyer announced that three power companies have agreed to turn over docum= ents subpoenaed months ago by his investigators. The attorney general went= to court to obtain the documents after the companies failed to meet a Mar= ch 19 deadline to hand them over. Lockyer said the forthcoming docu= ments would help his office as it sifts through mountains of evidence in s= earch of possible violations of antitrust or unfair business practice laws= . ""Evidence is accumulating that certainly infers illegal activity,""= Lockyer said. ""But we need to make sure it's compelling and clear enough = that you can convince a jury.""

Thanks. Linda Robertson 03/30/2001 12:31 PM To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron, Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, Mark Palmer/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Subject: White House Talking Points and Abraham Mtg with EPSA 1. I am faxing to you a bootleg copy of the draft talking points Ed received this morning at the White House energy ""messaging"" meeting. These are very close hold. Ed asked that we not circulate these to anyone. Ed asked us to give him feedback of any concerns we have with the talking points (he will be giving them comments). After glancing at the TPs, the obvious missing point is open access. However, I am not sure we should be alarmed about that. There really isn't any policy in the TPs. This is a typical WH message document. Let me know if you think it is imperative to insert open access. Also, Ed would like to position us as the coalition leader of the White House outreach effort. Any thoughts? 2. I am faxing to you EPSA's summary of the generators meeting with Secretary Abraham. I am glad I did not attend this meeting. As you will see from the summary, there were three parts to the meeting: a) an exchange of policy views, both long and short term, b) discussion of how to maximize generator output in Calif; and c) a request that industry participate in a DOE reliability group. I don't see any follow up for Enron, outside of our normal course of activities and independent interchange with DOE officials. Let me know if you have additional thoughts.

Subject:: Protecting Confidential Information: New European Restricted List
 Procedure
Body:: As you probably all know, we are on the verge of launching credit derivatives trading in Europe and North America, both on Enron Online and off-line. This will involve quoting prices for buying and selling bankruptcy protection in respect of reference entities, many of whom are our counterparties in a variety of different commercial and financial contexts. This exciting cocktail of credit derivatives and Enron Online raises significant novel legal risks for Enron. Probably the most significant risk arises where Enron has confidential information about a reference entity and wrongfully uses that information in pricing the credit derivative on that entity. This could well result in legal proceeding against Enron. In practice, an allegation of misuse of confidential information can be very difficult indeed to defend without adequate procedures in place to safeguard that information. Against this background is the ever-present risk of ""insider dealing"". This crime - which carries a maximum prison sentence of 7 years and an unlimited fine - is committed where a person (or member of their family etc) deals in the securities (shares or bonds) of a listed company on the basis of unpublished (confidential) price-sensitive information. In addition, SFA rules require the safeguarding of confidential information, the misuse of which is a serious disciplinary matter. In order to ensure the success of this new business, we are now introducing new policies and procedures (attached) which include a simple Restricted List procedure. In essence they require you - to take prudent steps to safeguard confidential information within Enron to notify Michael Brown, Mark Elliott or myself if you become aware of confidential information (or circumstances) about a counterparty which you think might make it appropriate for that counterparty to be placed on the Restricted List. To make life easier, numerous examples of the types of information which might be relevant are set out in the attached procedures, so please familiarise yourself, and anyone else in your group you think appropriate, with them. As you will see, you are not expected to make difficult determinations about whether an entity should or should not be added to the Restricted List, just to let us know if you think there is a possibility that it should be added. We will also provide quick briefing sessions to ensure that each of you is comfortable with these new procedures. Many thanks for your co-operation.

Subject:: ATTORNEY/CLIENT COMMUNICATION//////CONFIDENTIAL and Privileged
Body:: Article II of the NONCOMPETITION AGREEMENT entered in connection with the sale of HPL to AEP (which closed as of June 1,2001) provides: ""ENA [for 3 months post-close] will not solicit, negotiate or enter into any contract, agreement or arrangement for the purchase of natural gas on the HPL Pipeline from any Person which is a supplier or producer of natural gas connected to the HPL Facilities; provided, however, nothing herein shall be construed or interpreted as prohibiting ENA from entering into any such contract, agreement or arrangement which is less than one month in duration and involves or is related to an Enron Online transaction."" This is not the most clearly drafted provision as it was the subject of much negotiation....and was significantly narrowed from the original scope proposed by AEP. Thus, please consult with me prior to entering into any solicitation, agreement or arrangement which might arguably be covered by our limited covenant not to compete on the supply side for 3 months. There are many aspects of the post-close transition which will require cooperation between Enron and AEP/HPL and thus, it behoves us to carefully weigh the risks and rewards of ""stepping too close to or over the line"". Further,although a technical reading of the non-competition agreement only applies to ENA, no ENA UPSTREAM deals which would violate this covenant if there were to be done as ENA should be done without clearance from Brian Redmond and me. Please communicate this restriction to those who report to you and have need to be aware of this limited restriction.

Subject:: Re: Analysis by Academics----Why De-regulation is the right policy
 choice
Body:: I think we need some clear indication that with Hogan on the Board this is not going to turn into a diatribe about the benefits of LMP. He's the most informed of the bunch and I doubt he would find a general work of interest (unless he can create a platform for his more detailed ideas). If it stays general, I think the study is a good idea. One topic area might be to explore how politicians mess up the basic idea of deregualtion and suggest that the process needs to be handled in a more objective (and pure) fashion. Jeff Dasovich Sent by: Jeff Dasovich 03/16/2001 10:54 AM To: James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Joe Hartsoe/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Linda Robertson/NA/Enron@ENRON, Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@ENRON, skean@enron.com Subject: Re: Analysis by Academics----Why De-regulation is the right policy choice Great points. Teece---and the lion's share of the folks on the participants list---are advocates of a minimalist role for government, particularly where markets are a clear and preferably option, as in the case of electricity. That said, I think we're going to have to make a fundamental decision about what the goal of this ""study"" would be, which will determine, to a large degree, whether we choose to pursue it. I'll throw out for comment the notion that the study should be designed to serve one purpose: to influence the policy decision currently under debate ""To de-regulate or not."" As such, I wouldn't see issues like ""PJM or APX"" or ""competitive default supplier or not,"" or ""divest generation with vesting contracts or retain the assets"" being the focus. That debate over critically important implementation details, would seem to come in ""Round 2,"" once the initial debate over ""deregulate or not"" is won. To try to do both, i.e., resolve in the broad policy issue AND make the case for the specific, ""right"" implementation plan, would arguably bog the study down, perhaps interminably. And it seems that time is of the essence in the current environment. In addition, unless the fundamental policy issue is won--and won rather quickly--debating implementation may be moot. Of course, it will be impossible to avoid some level of dicussion on ""how to do it,"" but that would not be the emphasis. In sum, I'd suggest for comment that it only makes sense to proceed---particularly since time is of the essence---if we focus on the high level policy level question of ""to deregulate or not,"" and address implementation in a second, or follow up, study. I think we should try to make a call on this swiftly, since the ""go/no go"" decision would seem to flow from resolution of this issue. Best, Jeff James D Steffes 03/16/2001 08:22 AM To: Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron, Joe Hartsoe/Corp/Enron@Enron, Linda Robertson/NA/Enron@Enron, Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, skean@enron.com Subject: Re: Analysis by Academics----Why De-regulation is the right policy choice Jeff -- It would be helpful to get some feedback prior to starting to deal with the fundamental question related to direct access for smaller customers. I would like to know Teece's perspective on the role of government in this marketplace. In addition, I think that the paper must deal with the drawbacks of having mixed roles - utility default supply and competitive markets.

Clearly, we're at a fork in the policy road---move forward, or go back. I've (finally) gotten a proposal from the group. It's attached. Please take a look. I'd like to distribute more widely internally for comment, but wanted to run it through a preliminary screen to guage whether folks think it would be useful before cluttering up folks' in-boxes with more emails to read. Few points worth mentioning: The majority of the academics that would do the report are affiliated with LECG, Inc., the consulting group that I worked with prior to joing Enron. List also includes Dan McFadden, UC Berkeley nobel prize winner who wrote the recent op-ed piece in the WSJ. The list also includes Hogan and Joskow and Borenstein. We could certainly exclude these folks should we choose to go forward with the analysis. However, the goal is to produce a high level analysis, i.e., ""de-regulation is good and can work; command and control regulation is bad and we know that it does not work."" Once the study is released (if it is pursued), the ""authors"" could tour the country, testifying before federal and state bodies to advocate the virtues of de-regulation and the pitfalls of reversing course. The analysis would not be a debate over ""To Poolco, or not to Poolco, PJM, etc."" In this way, including folks like Joskow and Hogan could offer the added benefit of creating a ""Nixon goes to China"" scenario. Please take a look at the list of participants. Again, we can add to and subtract from the list. Laura Tyson would be one of the two project leaders. (The other would be David Teece, Chairman of LECG.) None of the folks on the list occupies either extreme of the political spectrum. It's a mix of D's and R's who are arguably centrist economist and strong believers in markets (I won't vouch for Joskow and Hogan). The idea would be to get a wide array of industry participants from across the country to support the project. This is for two reasons: 1) the more diverse the group supporting the effort, the greater the credibility, and 2) they are asking for about $1 million to do the study. If you think it would be useful to pursue the study as part of our national campaign to minimize the damage created by California, I would like to start immediately to approach trade associations, companies, customers, etc. nationwide to garner support for the project. Let me know if you think the effort would be worthwhile. Appreciate your comments.

Subject:: API Question; CONFIDENTIAL AND PRIVILEGED ATTORNEY/CLIENT
 COMMUNICATION & ATTORNEY'S WORK PRODUCT
Body:: Stan: V&E wrote/masterminded the partnership agreement for our MLP. It is complicated and has been amended several times. In view of these factors, V&E should tell us whether we can use the $2.5 million of cash from the insurance recovery to retroactively reclaim a portion of the 4th quarter API's. In particular, Baird should give us this opinion since he has handled the partnership agreement since day one. Baird is gone on vacation for the next week. He is planning to give us an answer within a few days of his return. He will give the matter serious thought, but what we are asking is pretty aggressive. His associate, Carlos Pena, has reviewed the partnership agreement and his first take on the question is that we cannot revise the available cash for the fourth quarter in this way. But the matter requires far more thought than this----and Bob will also need to talk with Lori (also gone on vacation) to come up with a meaningful answer for us. I will stay after this, but in light of the above, it will probably be early July b/f we get V&E's final position on this. If this won't do, please let me know and I'll explore other avenues of getting an answer out of V&E. Thanks. SWD

Subject:: FW: Southern, Regulators clash in Power grid fight
Body:: Very interesting article. -----Original Message----- From: Nersesian, Carin Sent: Wednesday, October 10, 2001 4:21 PM To: Robertson, Linda; Shelk, John; Shortridge, Pat Subject: Southern, Regulators clash in Power grid fight Atlanta Journal and Constitution October 10, 2001, Wednesday Copyright 2001 Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News Copyright 2001 The Atlanta Journal and Constitution Atlanta Journal and Constitution October 10, 2001, Wednesday KR-ACC-NO: AT-ENERGY LENGTH: 718 words HEADLINE: Southern Co., Regulators Clash in Power-Grid Fight BYLINE: By Matthew C. Quinn BODY: Southern Co. appears to be on the verge of losing a big-money power struggle over control of its four-state electricity transmission system. But both sides in the tug-of-war offer different takes on which result would help consumers and which would hurt them. At issue are long-distance transmission lines, mounted on huge steel towers, that carry electricity across state lines to towns and cities. Atlanta-based Southern Co. has invested $ 3 billion in its 26,000-mile system, but federal regulators want it to cede control to a larger agency that covers eight states. The matter is coming to a head now after three years of wrangling. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission wants to carve up the country into four regional transmission organizations, or RTOs, for the Southeast, Northeast, Midwest and West. Under such a plan, local utilities like Southern would be unable to stop competing power shipments from out-of-state suppliers. Regional transmission organizations ""yield significant customer savings,"" said FERC Chairman Pat Wood III. Commission spokeswoman Barbara Connors said lower rates will result when barriers to competitively priced electricity from outside the region are dropped and transmission costs reduced. But there are sharp differences of opinion on that score. Andy Dearman, Southern Co.'s chief transmission officer, cites estimates that a super-regional agency could cost more than $ 100 million to establish, and he says those costs could be passed on to consumers in the form of higher rates. According to Georgia Power Co., a Southern Co. subsidiary, transmission costs already account for about 6.5 percent of Georgia electricity bills. There's also a question of reliability when a new system is established, Dearman saud. ""It impacts the ability to keep the lights on,"" he said. Some state regulators, who stand to lose regulatory control, see a Washington power grab. ""We've got low prices and a reliable system,"" said Georgia Public Service Commissioner Stan Wise, who sees a back-door move toward utility deregulation of the sort that has failed with electricity in California and been severely tested with natural gas in Georgia. ""Don't tell me about the new system when I've got blood on my face from the last battle,"" Wise said. ""There are some parallels that make us squirm."" PSC Chairman Lauren ""Bubba"" McDonald wrote President Bush following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks urging a delay. ""This is not the time to consider or implement any change to the management of the nation's transmission grid,"" he said. But the federal commission has only toughened its position. Wood, a Texan recently named chairman by Bush, said last month he wants to use the commission's authorities as a ""stick"" to force reluctant utilities into line. Wood would deny utilities that refuse to join a ""new world"" of regional power grids by Dec. 15 the authority to charge deregulated prices and delay merger approvals for those firms. The commission plans a series of workshops in Washington next week for what Wood called the ""brightest minds available"" in the utility field to brainstorm over transmission reorganization plans. Southern Co. is sending a representative. Companies like Enron Corp., the Texas-based national energy suppler, are pressing for RTOs as the first step toward a national transmission grid -- a concept favored by the Bush administration. Prodded by federal regulators, Southern Co. in June agreed to dilute its control over the 26,000-mile system by joining with public power agencies in five states to form a larger, 39,000-mile transmission agency to be operated by an outside company. But a federal mediator rejected the plan. The issue has also split Southern Co. from onetime subsidiary Mirant Corp., an independent power company with plans to expand into the Southeast. Large regional grids are ""more cost-effective and reliable"" than the present territorial hodgepodge, said Mirant spokesman Buddy Eller. By encouraging development of new and cleaner power plants, the environment would benefit too, he added. But Wise called such predictions ""totally unproven.""

Please refer to the attached original memo, if you have not responded to David Oxley and have any comments please respond to him by May 25, 2001. Dave Delainey Following my note last week please find attached the consolidated peer group mapping for all business units. This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC. We were considering moving to a 3 Peer Group Structure however it as agreed at the last PRC Committee Meeting to stay with the current structure since the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most activities had been placed with the exception of just 2 or 3. It was agreed that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to 3 Peer Groups. All functions/activities within the business units should now be reflected on the acttached. The actions points from this excercise are: 1 to review and agree the attached mapping 2 consider and comment on highlighted groups that we have discussed in previous PRC meetings and ask for your comments or objections to moving them as indicated on the attachment. 3 invite your comments or questions on any other function that you consider questionable or requiring further explanation. Please return your comments to David Oxley by Friday May 25. To have this discussion now will save lengthy discussions in the final VP/MD PRC Meetings. Definitions of the peer groups are also attached for your ease of reference.

Emshwiller Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 05/22/2001 The Wall Street Journal A2 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) LOS ANGELES -- California may be struggling to keep its lights on, but one thing there is no shortage of is accusations over who is to blame for an electricity crisis that has sent power prices skyrocketing. In recent days, top California officials have stepped up their rhetoric against a handful of merchant power companies, many of them Texas-based, that supply the state with much of its juice. Gov. Gray Davis says companies such as Reliant Energy Inc., of Houston, have engaged in ""unconscionable price gouging."" Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission and a Davis appointee, proclaims that a ""cartel"" of electricity producers has created artificial shortages. Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante is backing a bill that would make energy price fixing a felony, and as a private citizen he is suing several major power producers in Los Angeles state court. About half a dozen investigations are being conducted by entities ranging from state legislative committees to the California attorney general's office. So far, these probes -- some of which have been under way for months -- haven't yet yielded either civil or criminal charges. While the energy suppliers are generating ""unconscionable profits,"" the question remains ""whether they are illegal profits,"" says California Attorney General Bill Lockyer, who has offered rewards of as much as hundreds of millions of dollars for information about lawbreaking in the energy business. Mr. Lockyer says he believes his office will eventually file civil charges against suppliers. He would very much like to add criminal counts. ""I would love to personally escort [Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth] Lay to an 8 x 10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says `Hi my name is Spike, honey,'"" adds Mr. Lockyer. Houston-based Enron is a major energy-trading company. Like other such firms, Enron has denied wrongdoing in the California market. Mark Palmer, Enron's vice president for corporate communications, said Mr. Lockyer's comment about Mr. Lay ""is so counterproductive that it doesn't merit a response."" Investigators and academics say there is abundant evidence that individual firms have been exercising ""market power."" This term is used to denote efforts to influence wholesale-electricity prices, such as by withholding supplies. The California Independent System Operator, or ISO, which manages the state's electric transmission grid, estimates that by exercising market power, suppliers may have added about $6.8 billion to the cost of electricity in the state since early last year. A single firm exercising such power isn't necessarily illegal, says Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy Institute. If a company is a large supplier in the state and ""you're not exercising market power, you are not doing your job"" on behalf of shareholders, he says. Mr. Borenstein and others say that there are steps that should be taken against suppliers. They note that under federal power law, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission can order refunds for wholesale prices that are above ""just and reasonable"" levels. So far, FERC has tentatively ordered California suppliers to make tens of millions of dollars of such refunds, as part of that agency's ongoing inquiry into the California market. Critics of the suppliers and FERC say the refunds should be in the billions of dollars. The power industry, not surprisingly, says there is nothing to accusations of price manipulation or collusion. Executives point to a botched state-utility-deregulation plan that relies heavily on volatile spot-market purchases. Suppliers note that over the past decade, California didn't build enough new power plants to keep up with demand growth. The allegations of manipulation are ""a lot of sound and fury and they won't produce anything,"" says Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an industry trade group. Power generators also point to sharp increases in some of their costs, particularly natural gas, which is a major power-plant fuel. This rise in natural-gas prices also has set off a flurry of investigations over possible manipulation. One such case, involving El Paso Corp., Houston, is the subject of probes by federal and state officials. El Paso denies any wrongdoing. While power-industry officials say they have been cooperating with the investigations, law-enforcement officials say they have hit some roadblocks. For instance, Mr. Lockyer's office has gone to San Francisco state court to enforce subpoenas against Reliant, Houston-based Dynegy Inc., and Southern Co. and Mirant Corp., both of Atlanta, after the companies resisted turning over certain business documents they deemed confidential. Investigators have zeroed in on the increased frequency with which plants are going out of service for unscheduled outages. At times, several thousand fewer megawatts of capacity are available than a year ago. A thousand megawatts can power about one million homes. Generators say that this increased ""forced outage"" rate shows that tight supplies over the past year have required them to run plants, some of them more than 40 years old, for long periods without routine maintenance. This combination has produced more breakdowns. ""Plants have been running flat out,"" says Tom Williams, a spokesman for Duke Energy Co., Charlotte, N.C., which says that its California power plants produced 50% more electricity in 2000 than in 1999. At the same time, during periods of lower demand, the number of unplanned outages often seems to rise enough to keep supplies tight, says Frank Wolak, a Stanford University professor and chairman of the ISO's market surveillance committee. ""Clearly, something is going on here."" However, he and others say that it is almost impossible to tell why a particular pipe failed or whether such a failure was a legitimate reason to reduce output. Some of the most intriguing evidence to date about forced outages surfaced in a federal case. FERC officials said an investigation had raised questions about whether two major power companies had taken plants out of service in order to reap higher electricity prices. The charges against AES Corp., Arlington, Va., which owns the plants, and Williams Cos., Tulsa, Okla., which markets their output, asserted that those actions allowed the companies to reap an extra $10.8 million in revenue. In one instance, according to case filings, a Williams employee ""indicated"" to AES officials that his firm wouldn't financially penalize AES for extending an outage at one plant. This conversation, which was voluntarily divulged by Williams, could be an indication of collusion. Williams and AES settled the case without admitting any wrongdoing by paying back $8 million to the ISO and by taking certain other measures. A Williams spokeswoman says the employee who talked to AES was ""counseled not to enter into any conversations of that nature"" in the future. Another issue raised by the FERC case touched on maintenance procedures. According to the filings, AES stopped doing a certain procedure to keep its plant's cooling system from getting clogged. The clogging of the system was cited as a reason for one of the forced outages. Mark Woodruff, president of the AES unit that operates the plant in question, says the company substituted what it felt was an equally effective maintenance procedure. If someone was looking to keep supplies tight and prices high, changes in maintenance procedures would be an easy way to ensure that plants, particularly old ones, have frequent forced outages, says a senior utility-industry executive. By restricting maintenance resources, he says, an operator can simply allow a plant ""to take itself out of service."" --- Journal Link: What is California doing to alleviate the energy crisis?

Business/Financial Desk; Section W Enron Unit Moves to End India Contract For Power By SARITHA RAI 05/22/2001 The New York Times Page 1, Column 6 c. 2001 New York Times Company BANGALORE, India, May 21 -- Fed up with its main customer's refusal to pay its bills, the Enron Corporation's Indian power-generating venture served formal notice on Saturday that it would terminate its power supply contract and pull out. The move by the Dabhol Power Company, 65 percent owned by Enron, starts the clock ticking on a six-month notice period before the contract is voided, during which negotiations to settle the dispute are expected. The $2.9 billion Dabhol project represents the largest single foreign investment in India. Separately, Enron said today that it was withdrawing from a pipeline project in Qatar, which would have supplied some gas to Dabhol. The company said that the two steps were unrelated. The Dabhol project has been the subject of a series of wrangles between the company and the governments of India and of the western Indian state of Maharashtra. The state-owned utility company that contracted to buy power from the Dabhol plant has defaulted on some $64 million in unpaid power bills, and has accused Dabhol of charging too much. Dabhol said it was left with little choice but to issue the termination notice after both governments failed to honor their contractual commitments to buy and pay for its output. But in a statement issued over the weekend, Dabhol said it was ''still open to constructive discussion on the solutions.'' The company said a ''lasting and feasible solution'' to the dispute would require that the two governments either honor their obligations to buy Dabhol's power or find other creditworthy buyers to take the power instead. The first phase of the project now generates 740 megawatts of power, and the second phase, adding another 1,444 megawatts of capacity, is scheduled to go on line next month. Under the contract, the termination that Enron has set in motion would oblige the federal and state governments to pay damages to Enron and the lenders that financed the project, possibly as much as $500 million -- the value of a year's output of power plus the project's $300 million in debt -- if it is shut down.

California; Metro Desk The State GOP Criticizes Davis' Choice of PR Aides Capitol: Legislative leaders call the pair political operatives who are too partisan to represent the state during energy crisis. DAN MORAIN TIMES STAFF WRITER 05/22/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition B-8 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO -- Republican legislative leaders Monday blasted Gov. Gray Davis' decision to spend $30,000 a month in taxpayer money to retain communications consultants known for their highly partisan work. Labeling consultants Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane as ""cut-throat,"" Senate GOP leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga and Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks said in a letter to Davis that the hiring ""undermines the assertions you have made both publicly and privately throughout this crisis."" Davis announced Friday that he retained the duo and that the state will pay them a combined $30,000 a month for at least the next six months. ""We're not going to support the hiring of political hacks on government payroll,"" Brulte said in an interview. ""Lehane and Fabiani are very talented. The issue is which payroll is appropriate. . . . These are political opposition research attack dogs. If the governor wants them, he ought to pay for them with his $30-million political war chest."" Some consumer advocates also criticized the move, citing the consultants' work on behalf of Southern California Edison. In their private consulting business, Fabiani and Lehane are working to win over public and political support for Davis' $3.5-billion plan to rescue Edison from its financial difficulties. Legislation embodying aspects of the deal is pending in Sacramento. On Monday, Brulte and Cox also complained about the consultants' dual role. ""California taxpayers should not be asked to finance political consultants or individuals who have a vested business interest with the state,"" the letter said. Fabiani and Lehane had worked in the Clinton administration, and in Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign, where they gained a reputation as attack-oriented operatives. Lehane on Monday defended the governor's decision to use tax money to pay their fees, saying government often hires outside experts and that he and Fabiani will ""serve as communications advisors to help the governor fight against these generators."" ""The Republicans,"" Lehane added, ""ought to be spending time writing letters to George W. Bush to get him to stop the Texas generators from gouging California. . . . That is the real issue here."" Davis, meanwhile, returned to California on Monday after a weekend of fund-raisers. He was in Texas on Saturday for a Dallas event that had been scheduled for April 11. It was postponed when Pacific Gas & Electric filed for bankruptcy protection. ""There is a very large fund-raising base for Democrats in Texas,"" Davis' campaign strategist, Garry South, said of the state that is home to some of the generators that Davis has criticized. Davis traveled to Chicago for another fund-raiser Sunday, then met Monday with city officials to discuss how Chicago deals with electrical blackouts. After blackouts crippled downtown Chicago in the summer of 1999, Mayor Richard M. Daley demanded that the city's electricity provider, Commonwealth Edison, give advance notice of power cuts. Customers now sometimes receive warnings two or three days in advance. Davis emerged from the meeting saying ""the utilities have got to tell us in advance when they're going to have a planned blackout."" It was not, however, readily apparent how Chicago's solutions would translate to California, because its electrical problems are vastly different. Rather than suffering a shortage of electricity throughout the grid like California, Chicago has the more microcosmic ills of an aging system--an obsolete transformer going down, for example, leaving several city blocks in the dark until workers can fix it. * Times staff writer Eric Slater contributed to this story.

Profit rose 63% to 468 million euros; earnings and pretax profit were both helped by one-time gains of 454 million euros. Operating profit fell 59% in the retail-banking division to 98 million euros, and was down 43% in the international-markets division to 184 million euros. HypoVereinsbank said tough market conditions world-wide reduced regular commission and interest income. Enron Pulls Out of Emirates Gas Project U.S. energy company Enron has decided to pull out of the multibillion-dollar Dolphin natural-gas project, selling its 24.5% stake to the United Arab Emirates Offsets Group, or UOG, according to Dolphin Energy's managing director, Ahmed Al-Sayigh. He didn't specify the reason for Enron's withdrawal or the value of Enron's stake. The Dolphin project agreement, reached two years ago by UOG and Qatar Petroleum, aims to bring two billion cubic feet a day of natural gas from Qatar's offshore North Field in the Persian Gulf to Abu Dhabi and onward to Dubai. Enron and France's TotalFinaElf each held a 24.5% stake, with UOG owning the remaining 51%. Mr. Sayigh said UOG will hold discussions with other companies on a possible sale of Enron's original stake. Richard Bergester, manager for Enron Middle East, said that having contributed to the project's initial stages, Enron now feels it can't ""add"" any more. He didn't elaborate.

By Narayanan Madhavan 05/22/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. BANGALORE, India, May 22 (Reuters) - India's technology state of Karnataka, spurred by a payments row involving U.S. power developer Enron Corp in a neighbouring province, has reopened sealed power purchase deals with 11 private firms. The southern state's government has told independent power producers (IPPs), which are yet to start generation, that they need to make their tariffs more competitive, officials said. ""Now it (electricity) cannot be at any cost,"" V.P. Baligar, chairman and managing director of the Karnataka State Power Transmission Corp Ltd (KPTCL), the state's monopoly power distributor, told Reuters in an interview late on Monday. The move comes on the heels of the bitter wrangle in Maharashtra state involving Dabhol Power Co, 65-percent owned by Houston-based Enron. Dabhol issued a preliminary notice on Saturday to end a contract to sell power to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board. The step came after Maharashtra ceased payments saying Dabhol's tariffs were too high. The $2.9-billion project, which is 90-percent complete, was first billed as a showcase of India's decade-old reform programme but now is regarded by critics as a symbol of policy bungling. ""Enron is a lesson for all of us,"" Baligar said. Karnataka also said it would not provide financial assurances in the form of escrow cover and government loan guarantees which the firms wanted to help sweeten lending rates. ""We're trying to tell them your tariff has to be competitive,"" Baligar said, but added that the state was open to negotiations. ""You have to have the final capability so you can implement the project without any guarantee or escrow."" SIGNED DEALS Five years ago, the state signed power purchase deals with 14 private firms. Three of them are already generating power at rates higher than the state would now like to pay. They will continue to get these rates but the 11 unbuilt units face an uncertain future. The 11 plants involve 2,000 megawatts (MW) of capacity, half of which would be supplied by the Mangalore Power Co (MPC) from which U.S.-based Cogentrix exited in 1999, citing litigation and delays in government approval. China Light & Power now owns the company, in which India's Tata group is expected to take 30 percent. MPC Managing Director V.P. Sharma told Reuters that his firm's project would not be hit by the demand for lower tariffs because it was based on coal unlike the Enron project, based on naphtha. ""Our cost is the lowest cost approved (and) coal prices have fallen (since the agreement),"" Sharma told Reuters from Bombay. Company officials say the project is also looking forward to a federal guarantee to help it move forward. Baligar said the government's intention was to weed out those who are not serious. ""Those who are serious can sit with us and sort out their problems,"" he said. Power tariffs vary, depending upon foreign exchange rates and the type and prices of fuels. Three projects which are already generating power get about 3.0 to 4.0 rupees (6.4 to 8.5 U.S. cents) per unit. The 11 uninstalled plants had comparable rates but MPC says falling coal prices helped its competitiveness. One generating firm, Jindal Tractabel, which uses coal and gas, gets about 2.60 rupees. Its purchase agreement was not among the 14 and is awaiting regulatory approval. The state wants the Jindal rate to be the benchmark for reopened agreements. If private firms cut capital costs and work out long-term fuel supplies, they will be able to cut rates, Baligar said. The state says it needs 4,000 MW of new capacity over 10 years and 2,500 MW over five years. State-run utilities are in a position to meet five-year needs at low rates, Baligar said. Asked if Karnataka could face litigation over the reopening of the contracts, Baligar had legally strong arguments. ( $1 = 46.9 rupees). Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. INDIA: India utility may slap 4bln rupee fine on Enron unit. 05/22/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. BOMBAY, May 22 (Reuters) - An Indian utility is planning to impose a second penalty of four billion rupees ($85 million) on Enron's local unit, barely a week after the U.S. energy giant took its first step to pull out of the embattled project. A senior official at the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) said on Tuesday the fine on Dabhol Power Company (DPC) was for not meeting capacity targets within a stipulated period. ""We will do this as soon as the bill for May is received next month,"" the official told Reuters. DPC officials declined to comment on the matter. Earlier this year, MSEB had imposed a similar penalty on DPC - which DPC has not paid - saying its plant could not be ramped up to full capacity within three hours from a cold start. Enron and MSEB have been battling for six months over payment defaults and last week DPC, owned 65 percent by Enron, issued a preliminary notice to terminate a power purchase agreement - widely seen as a move that would lead to a pull out. According to DPC, it is owed $48 million by MSEB. A top government official told Reuters in Delhi on Monday the federal government is optimistic Houston-based Enron and the Maharashtra state will resolve their wrangle. The agreement signed between MSEB and DPC in 1995 stipulates that if Dabhol's plant cannot achieve 100 percent capacity within three hours from restart, MSEB is entitled to impose a penalty. The MSEB official said the plant had failed to fulfil this condition in February and March, considered peak periods for power demand by the utility. DPC is building a $2.9 billion, 2,184 MW plant, of which the first phase of 740 MW began operations in May 1999. Enron is India's largest foreign investor. ($1=47.0 Indian rupees).

Power corrupts... 05/22/2001 The Economic Times Copyright (C) 2001 The Economic Times; Source: World Reporter (TM) APROPOS of Enrons notice to the government of Maharashtra, Mumbai should act pragmatically instead of indulging in heroics and rhetoric. It should set its own house in order, improve MSEBs functioning and quickly privatise. If it fails to do these its threat to Enron will also be taken as just another case of demanding kickbacks. IT is sad really that Enron had to issue its pre-termination notice. We should now ask whether MSEB would be able to construct such a project in record time. Corruption is rampant in MSEB. They may say Enron power is not needed, but you cannot even get a new connection easily. Interruptions are commonplace in rural areas (sometimes up to four times a week). Power thefts are commonplace too. Each day, on average, we pay MSEB about Rs 6 per unit for commercial connections. But most people would be willing to pay Rs 7 or so if they got clean, uninterrupted power. We have seen, for example, the vast cost overruns of many of the official water management projects. These overruns go up to 20 times, with delays stretching up to 10 years with no guarantee no results even then. All told, the government is sending very wrong signals to the international community by raking up the Enron controversy. It should set its own house in order. THE new state ministries are too big in size West Bengals in particular. It has allotted one minister just to deal with fire brigades. The expenditure in lakhs it entails could exceed the total number of fire tenders under the department. Despite that it needed 7 complete days to control a recent fire (with private tankers requisitioned to help over and above the ones owned by the corporation and municipalities). We need more fire tenders, not ministers or those who are associated with the big boss. Also we need a new minister, plus a full-fledged department, to examine corrupt practices in local government and also in the central government offices located in states. Meanwhile, was the Sarkaria Commissions recommendation to restrict the size of the ministry to within 10 per cent of the size of the Assembly advanced only to be flouted? We should call a stop to such commissions as not even 10 per cent of their purpose is served; they too entail huge establishments which are maintained year after year at taxpayer expense. SINCE 1993, I have been familiar with the political, social and business scenarios in the US and so I feel reasonably qualified to make some observations on US immigration policy by Sudhir Shah. Shahs statistics are not totally accurate but they depict the `global picture. The Indian immigrants (a million plus now) are, in many respects, a class apart. Their education levels are far higher than those of other immigrants, many of whom are just a grade above our rag-pickers (they are the cherry and berry pickers on US farms). I have not come across a single uneducated Indian in the US since 1983. Even in asset-formation, Indians (even Pakistanis) are leagues ahead of the other immigrants. B T Dasture, Mumbai - Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. The Godbole findings Our Editorial 05/22/2001 Business Standard 15 Copyright (c) Business Standard The Godbole committee's first report, submitted on 10 April, is an eye-opener to what can only be called a massive scandal. It leaves several players MSEB, successive Maharashtra governments, the Kirit Parikh re-negotiation exercise, the Central Electricity Authority, and other players in New Delhi with no clothes on. MSEB claimed that it had negotiated a tariff that was lower than would result from applying the central government's standard formula. But this was patently fraudulent, because the comparison was based on wrong numbers, incorrect technical parameters and unequal assumptions (one rupee-dollar rate for the Dabhol tariff, another for calculating the government formula), all of it designed to establish what was not true. Asked in court why there had been no competitive bidding, the answer (believe it or not) was that MSEB was not competent to handle competitive bidding. But it was so wonderfully capable of handling direct tariff negotiations that it eventually gave Dabhol a higher tariff than Enron had initially sought, before the negotiations began! That's only for starters. There is much more in the Godbole report. On the basis of a passing comment in an FIPB meeting, that the project's costs were broadly in line with other similar projects, the power secretary in New Delhi tells the Central Electricity Authority that the CEA's techno-economic clearance is not required though this is statutorily mandated. The CEA agrees to this untenable proposition, but later issues a vaguely worded clearance on the basis of a meeting whose minutes were not made available to the Godbole committee. The re-gasification project that was made part of the power project had a capacity to handle 5 million tonnes, though Dabhol itself needed only 2.1 million tonnes. A port facility had similar excess capacity. Yet the entire cost of these facilities was loaded on to Dabhol, along with the full cost of the 20-year gas supply contract. Thus, as the Godbole committee observes, what should have been a variable cost was converted to part of the fixed cost, which MSEB would have to service through a capacity charge, whether any power or gas was bought or not. Even the power requirements of Maharashtra were mis-calculated in order to over-ride a warning from the World Bank that the Dabhol power would not be needed. This was done by assuming that industrial demand for power would grow overnight at twice the earlier rate, and that MSEB itself would overnight see a dramatic worsening of its operating parameters. There is still more in the report, but the point should be obvious. What the report shows is that the Dabhol contract can be subjected to legal test (as in fact two members of the Godbole committee recommend), on the grounds that it was improperly handled and violative of law and common sense. If a favourable judicial decision becomes possible, that should help mitigate the costs of winding up a truly scandalous project. For reasons that are not clear, MSEB and the Maharashtra government have chosen not to go down this route. Perhaps they have greater and continuing faith in the re-negotiation process. Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. SMARTMONEY.COM: Power Grab By Elizabeth Harris 05/21/2001 Dow Jones News Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Feeling squeezed by rising electricity bills and shrinking investment returns? Consider investing in utilities, which posted solid gains amid the recent bear-market carnage. But plugging into this volatile sector is risky business, as anyone who piled in this year based on energy's surge in 2000 can testify. After returning 7.28% last year as demand for power outstripped supply, the average utilities fund is so far down 1% through May 18, according to the fund research firm Morningstar. Though the sector's prospects remain attractive, such volatility is par for the course, says Mark Beckwith, portfolio manager of the Vanguard Utilities Income fund (VGSUX). Utilities and funds that focus on the sector no longer perform like bonds, delivering most of the gains via relatively predictable dividend yields. Instead, the industry has greater growth prospects (and the correspondingly higher potential for losses) tied to the fluctuating demand for power. Already, high prices for natural gas and electricity have created incentives for producers to boost supplies. And the stodgy local monopolies that once dominated the industry must now reckon with a bevy of independent producers, distributors and traders. Even telecom companies are now considered fair game, offering managers of sector funds fresh choices alongside greater risk. ""The classification of a utility has changed,"" Beckwith says. At the same time, the crisis gripping electricity-starved California is showing other states the pitfalls to avoid as they deregulate their grids. ""The outlook for wiser deregulation is very much with us,"" says Bill Reaves, a manager of the Strong American Utilities fund (SAMUX). The crisis out west has also spurred construction of new power plants from New York to Florida, he adds. Managers also count on continued political support from the former oilmen in the White House who are determined to boost domestic output. With such inducements in mind, we screened Morningstar's database looking for no-load utilities portfolios with one-year returns of at least 1% and three-year annualized returns of 5% or more. We also sought funds with initial investment minimums no higher than $3,000 and expense ratios below the category's average. Strong American Utilities Bill Reaves, co-manager of the Strong American Utilities fund, characterizes the $290 million portfolio's positions as ""real utilities."" ""We try to concentrate in the electric and natural-gas area,"" Reaves says. ""We try to concentrate in holdings and companies where we see good growth."" Last year, that meant scaling back significantly from telecom stocks, in part because of a deteriorating outlook. Right now, electric utilities represent 44.5% of the fund - and Dominion Resources (D) is the largest position. Energy ranging from gas utilities to integrated oil and gas companies has also been a significant holding, at 24.2%. Reaves and the rest of the portfolio management team are also very sensitive to valuations. The portfolio consists of 40 stocks, but the managers can devote up to 75% of the fund's assets to the 16 to 18 companies seen as the best bargains. This cautious approach has stood the fund well at a time when some of its competitors got hit by telecoms' travails. The Strong portfolio rose 27.33% in 2000 and is up 2.42% so far this year, contributing to a 15.18% three-year record. Reaves expects the good times to last, with industry earnings growth on the order of 8% to 10% coupled with dividends of about 5% over the next three to five years. ""Demand is likely to keep on being strong...and the value of the service is going to be appreciated a great deal more,"" Reaves says. For example, the electric utilities' average price-to-earnings ratio for 2002 is about 12 - roughly a 50% discount to the Standard & Poor's 500 index. The minimum investment is $2,500, and the portfolio bears a 1% expense ratio. Vanguard Utilities Income ""We won't be moving with the Nasdaq,"" says portfolio manager Beckwith of the Vanguard Utilities Income fund he runs. Beckwith invests a relatively small 17% slice of the $900 million fund in telecom stocks. As with the other funds in this screen, such caution paid off last year, when the fund gained 18.7%. That turned the tables on 1999, when the technology boom consigned Vanguard Utilities to the rear echelon of its peer group. Annualized over three years, the portfolio has returned 9.33%, trailing the average utilities' fund's 10.53%. Here, too, the emphasis is on attractive valuations. Beckwith also has a mandate to invest at least 95% of the portfolio in dividend-paying utilities (last year, all assets had to be invested in such stocks.) ""I'm going to get as much growth as I can without taking on too much risk,"" Beckwith says. Right now, Beckwith has 61% of his assets in defensive electric utilities such as Dominion Resources or the FPL Group (FPL). The portfolio is down 2.65% so far this year, but Beckwith, too, is counting on continued strong demand for electricity. ""Earnings momentum will be very good for the group at least over the next year,"" he says. His main concern is that high energy prices could encourage conservation, eventually depressing demand. The investment threshold is $3,000, and the expense ratio is a slim 0.38%. American Gas Index fund This concentrated portfolio rises and falls with the gas industry's prospects. Strong natural-gas prices boosted the American Gas Index fund's (GASFX) return last year to a 55.86%, far above the sector's average. That more than offset the 3.71% drop in 1999. Annualized over three years, the roughly $300 million fund has gained 15.82%. Like other index portfolios, the fund doesn't make stock picks; instead it owns 73 members of the American Gas Association, representing much of the gas distribution and transmission industry in most U.S. regions. Stocks are weighted by market-cap and by the portion of a company's assets involved in natural gas. Top holdings include Williams Companies (WMB), Enron (ENE) and Duke Energy (DUK). The initial investment is $2,500, and expenses are 0.85%.

Malaysian LNG Sales to India Threatened by Enron Power Dispute 2001-05-22 06:32 (New York) Malaysian LNG Sales to India Threatened by Enron Power Dispute Kuala Lumpur, May 22 (Bloomberg) -- Malaysia LNG Tiga Sdn. may have to find new buyers for as much as 2.6 million metric tons a year of liquefied natural gas if Dabhol Power Co. carries through termination of electricity supplies to India's Maharashtra State Electricity Board. MLNG Tiga has an agreement to deliver a maximum 2.6 million tons a year of LNG each year to an import terminal Enron is building to feed the Dabhol power plant. Saturday, Dabhol Power, 65 percent owned by Enron Corp. of the U.S., started a procedure to end its power supply contract to the electricity board, its sole customer, which owes over 3 billion Indian rupees ($64 million) in unpaid power bills. ``It is our hope that matters in India would be resolved,'' said Azman Ibrahim, spokesman for state-owned Petroliam Nasional Bhd., which owns 60 percent of MLNG Tiga. ``If they do not work out, we would have to find or make alternative arrangements.'' MLNG Tiga is constructing Malaysia's third gas export facility, which will raise the country's LNG capacity to 23 million tons from about 16 million tons in 2000. If Dabhol goes through with cancellation of its power supply contract, MLNG Tiga would have to find buyers for more than a third of the 6.8 million tons it is adding to Malaysia's output capacity. Other partners in MLNG Tiga are the Sarawak state government with a 10 percent share, Royal Dutch/Shell Group's unit Shell Gas BV with 15 percent, Nippon Oil LNG (Netherlands) BV with 10 percent and Diamond Gas Netherlands BV with 5 percent. The plant is due to be completed at the end of 2002 with commercial production due to begin in 2003. India's federal and state governments may have to pay Dabhol Power Co. more than 170 billion rupees ($3.6 billion) if the Enron Corp. unit cancels its 2,184 megawatt power venture. LEADER: India unplugged Financial Times; May 22, 2001 The latest threat from Enron, the US energy group, to pull out of its Dabhol power plant venture near Bombay illustrates both the shambolic nature of India's electricity system and the wider risks of investing in the country. The project had serious drawbacks. But unless energy companies can expect a commercial return, they will not invest in badly needed new infrastructure. Unless contracts are honoured, few foreign companies will consider India as a place to do business. The Maharashtra state electricity board, the Dabhol plant's only customer, is refusing to pay its bills, arguing that the tariffs are unjustifiably inflated. Prices are certainly high. The plant, fuelled by expensive naphtha, is running way below capacity due to unexpectedly low demand, further increasing unit costs. More difficult to judge is whether this is within the terms of the contract, since Enron is keeping the details confidential. The argument over unit costs, though, is in any case less relevant than it might seem as most of India's state electricity boards, including Maharashtra's, operate at a large loss. Many consumers pay highly subsidised rates. Many pay nothing. Bills go uncollected. Half of Delhi's electricity output is stolen, mostly to power middle-class air conditioners rather than light bulbs for the poor. Bankrupt state utilities are then periodically bailed out to the detriment of spending on health and education. India's state authorities urgently need to introduce a common minimum tariff and a more targeted form of subsidy. This may be unpopular, but the central government's offer of Dollars 5.6bn, raised via a bond issue, to pay off the electricity boards' debts should sweeten the pill. A new pricing regime is only the first step. Electricity generation, transmission and distribution should be unbundled and privatised. Contracts should be awarded through competition, not by arrangement with the relevant political party. This would require much more transparency than many of India's politicians have been ready to concede. Enron's difficulties over the Dabhol plant, the largest foreign investment in India, have persuaded other western companies to withdraw from similar projects. This will hardly help the country to overcome the power shortages that hinder economic development. But the effect will reverberate well beyond the energy sector. India receives a pitifully small slice of the world's foreign direct investment. Infrastructure weaknesses are certainly one factor. But as important is the readiness of Indian politicians to manipulate foreign business for their own ends. Copyright: The Financial Times Limited May 22, 2001 Houston Chronicle Enron pulls out of venture drilling in Qatar's waters By LAURA GOLDBERG Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle Enron Corp. is pulling out of a large natural gas project off Qatar, the company said Monday. Plans for the Dolphin project called for Houston-based Enron to work with Elf, a subsidiary of France's TotalFinaElf, and the United Arab Emirates Offsets Group to develop and pipe natural gas from a block of the Qatar North Field. More than a year ago those involved with the project said it could end up requiring investments of up to $10 billion over six or seven years. Enron said Monday it was transferring its 24.5 percent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offsets Group, which said in a news release it had started negotiating with other international players to become stakeholders. With the transfer, United Arab Emirates Offsets Group will own 75.5 percent of Dolphin. Terms of the deal weren't released. Enron pulled out for a couple reasons, including that it believes there are better places to invest its money, said Alex Parsons, a company spokesman in London. The project doesn't necessarily fit with Enron's current focus. It is emphasizing businesses such as marketing and trading in wholesale markets such as those for natural gas, electricity and broadband. Enron said it would consider future ventures with the United Arab Emirates Offsets Group that were ""in line with our core business activities."" M. Carol Coale, an energy analyst with Prudential Securities in Houston, said Enron's move is consistent with its exit strategy from international assets that generate low returns. May 22, 2001 Houston Chronicle Enron exploring commodity trading Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle News Services NEW YORK -- Houston-based Enron Corp., the nation's largest natural gas and electricity trading house, is looking to continue its expansion into industries beyond energy with a move into the cocoa, coffee and sugar businesses, industry sources said Monday. Enron has had conversations and interviews with members of the commodity trade in recent weeks, using a London-based recruitment firm to help them, the sources said. ""They are definitely interested in getting into the business. Enron has been looking for physical traders. They have some internal people and are looking for lieutenants with experience,"" a cocoa trader said. A representative of Enron's public relations department would only say that the firm is constantly investigating different markets and opportunities. ""There is always a lot of speculation about what we are doing,"" Habiba Bayi of Enron said Monday. May 22, 2001 Houston Chronicle Local and state Plains Resources gets new officers Former executives of Enron and Kinder Morgan are among those chosen for a new slate of officers at Plains Resources, an oil and gas exploration and production company that had been sharing management with Plains All American Pipeline. They are filling vacancies created by people who went over to the pipeline side, said spokeswoman Carolyn Tice. John T. Raymond, who was vice president of corporate development at Kinder Morgan and Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, was appointed executive vice president and chief operating officer of Plains Resources. Jere Overdyke Jr., formerly managing director of Enron Global Markets, was named executive vice president and chief financial officer. Timothy Stephens, formerly chairman, president and chief executive of Abacan Resource Corp., was named general counsel and executive vice president-administration.

My impression is that our commendable efforts to build transatlantic synergies are resulting in too many get-togethers that require substantial travel. Our challenge is that such gatherings are far more costly and time-consuming for us to attend than our Houston colleagues might realize. Often, participating in these meetings takes an entire week for Enron Europe employees (especially if they are outside of Texas). Naturally, they may feel that this time of year (PRC time) is exactly the wrong time from a career perspective to miss this kind of gathering. These off-sites are sometimes scheduled at the end of a quarter, which compounds the difficulty; worse still are the times they occur at the end of Q2, since it also coincides and conflicts with the PRC process. I would appreciate your efforts to remind your managers to consider the travel time and costs (both direct and indirect) when inviting international employees to off-site meetings in the US. We appreciate the chance to be included in the broader Enron initiatives and to share ideas across organizations, but we are really trying to reinforce the message about managing expenses. Thanks! John Sherriff (Letter sent to all Enron Europe VPs and direct reports) We still have issues regarding Offsites and 'Team Building' exercises. In particular, we have recently had examples of departments failing to inform other key work groups when workplace absences are pending. In order to avoid misunderstandings, and to increase transparency, the following will apply with immediate effect: Any Offsite or 'Team Building' exercise which any group (both commercial and non-commercial, and including John and myself)intends to undertake must be communicated, in advance, to all department heads. Issue to be identified include: all participants who will out of the office, total costs of the exercise; and, where appropriate, work load coverage details. John and I are very supportive of team building exercises but we much prefer that they be conducted in the evenings or at weekends. To the extent that is not possible, we must absolutely avoid quarter ends and ensure all work is appropriately covered. Trips to Houston and especially resorts in the US are far more difficult to justify based on the substantial travel time and costs involved. So please pay particular attention to optimising our transatlantic travel. Please communicate this policy to your staff. Michael Brown

Donnelly could lead to a= =20 mass exodus by hundreds of small energy producers that have been selling=20 power to the state's financially troubled utilities for months without=20 getting paid. ?????At the same time, it may have staved off plans by a group of the small= =20 generators to send Edison into involuntary bankruptcy as early as today. ?????In Sacramento, energy legislation pushed by Gov. Gray Davis passed in= =20 the state Senate but foundered in the Assembly. The measure was intended to= =20 ensure that the state gets repaid for the electricity that it has been buyi= ng=20 on behalf of Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric, which say they lack the cas= h=20 and credit to purchase power. The bill also was supposed to guarantee that= =20 the small, alternative energy producers--which together provide nearly a=20 third of the state's power--get paid. But Assembly Republicans opposed it,= =20 saying it hadn't been given sufficient scrutiny. ?????The impact of the small producers was made clear in Imperial County,= =20 where Edison's failure to pay CalEnergy, the county's biggest property=20 taxpayer, had outsize implications. CalEnergy had put county officials on= =20 notice that it was about to miss a $3.8-million property tax payment. The= =20 uncertainty had prompted the tiny Calipatria Unified School District to=20 postpone a bond issue for badly needed school repairs. ?????Among CalEnergy Chairman David Sokol's first acts after the judge's=20 ruling Thursday was to promise Imperial County Supervisor Wally J. Leimgrub= er=20 that the company would pay its property taxes on time. ?????""That is great news,"" Leimgruber said. ?????Within hours of its court victory, CalEnergy had stopped transmitting= =20 geothermal power to Edison and begun selling it to El Paso Energy, a=20 marketing company that purchased the energy at prevailing rates and resold = it=20 on the spot market. ?????Some of the more than 700 other small energy producers in the state sa= id=20 they were considering similar action against Edison and Pacific Gas &=20 Electric. ?????""We absolutely need the right to sell to third parties,"" said Dean=20 Vanech, president of Delta Power, a New Jersey company that owns five small= =20 gas-fired plants in California and is owed tens of millions of dollars by= =20 Edison. ?????Sokol praised the Imperial County judge and said his company simply=20 wanted the authority to sell its power ""to a credit-worthy company that, in= =20 fact, pays for the power."" ?????An Edison spokesman said the company was disappointed with the ruling,= =20 but sympathized with CalEnergy and other small producers because=20 ""California's power crisis has placed [them] in financial distress, just as= =20 it has placed utilities in financial distress."" ?????Edison expressed concern that the ruling would prompt CalEnergy and=20 other small producers to sell their power out of state. Sokol said CalEnerg= y=20 had specifically told El Paso Energy that it hoped its power would remain i= n=20 California, ""but if someone wants to pay a higher price out of state, we=20 can't stop them."" ?????Sokol said that Edison still owes CalEnergy $140 million and that the= =20 company--along with seven other small producers--had been prepared to file = a=20 petition in federal bankruptcy court in Los Angeles today forcing the utili= ty=20 into involuntary bankruptcy. He said his company no longer intends to do so= ,=20 and he believed--but wasn't certain--that the other companies would shelve= =20 their plans. ?????Edison filed papers Thursday with the federal Securities and Exchange= =20 Commission showing that it owed $840 million to various small electricity= =20 producers, many of which rely on renewable energy sources such as geotherma= l=20 steam, solar energy or wind. ?????The alternative energy producers--and utilities--strenuously objected = to=20 the legislation considered in Sacramento on Thursday. The bill, spelling ou= t=20 how the utilities are to pay the state and the small producers, passed the= =20 Senate on a 27-9 vote, the exact two-thirds margin required. But it stalled= =20 in the Assembly on a 46-23 party-line vote, well short of two-thirds. ?????""When I was a citizen back in Lancaster, I heard these stories about= =20 pieces of legislation that were cooked up late at night, that . . . were cu= t=20 and pasted together and were rammed through by the Legislature,"" Assemblyma= n=20 George Runner (R-Lancaster) said. ""That's exactly what we have before us."" ?????The alternative electricity generators, including oil companies, warne= d=20 that they would lose money under the Davis proposal, while representatives = of=20 Edison and PG&E, which have amassed billions in debt in the worsening energ= y=20 crisis, said the legislation would push them deeper into the hole. ?????""There isn't enough money,"" Edison attorney Ann Cohn testified at a=20 Senate hearing on the bill Thursday. ""It is a very simple question: Dollars= =20 going out cannot be greater than dollars coming in."" ?????The bill, AB 8X, combined several proposals. First, it sought to clari= fy=20 earlier legislation by spelling out that Edison and PG&E must pay the state= =20 all money collected from consumers for electricity that the state has been= =20 buying. ?????Additionally, the bill would turn over to the California Public=20 Utilities Commission the thorny issue of how much to pay alternative energy= =20 producers for their electricity. ?????Wind, solar and geothermal producers might agree to the prices offered= =20 by the administration.

Thanks From: Jeff Dasovich on 07/18/2001 08:18 PM Sent by: Jeff Dasovich To: Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, skean@enron.com, Susan J Mara/NA/Enron@ENRON, Harry Kingerski/Enron@EnronXGate, James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Linda Robertson/NA/Enron@ENRON, Susan M Landwehr/Enron@EnronXGate, mpalmer@enron.com, Karen Denne/Enron@EnronXGate, Janel Guerrero/Enron@EnronXGate, Paul Kaufman/Enron@EnronXGate cc: Subject: California Update 07.18.01 The Senate, the Assembly and the Governor are either poised to engage in very difficult negotiations, or the three are about to crash and burn and Edison's going to be left dangling. In the Senate: The Senate bill 78XX is with about 90% likelihood going to be voted out of the Senate tonight---without a vote having taking place in any committee. Burton announced during one of the two ""informational"" hearings that ""this is it,"" despite the view of just about everyone who appeared before the committees the bill likely won't prevent Edison from going bankrupt. The key features of the bill are: Banks and QFs get paid in full. Edison shareholders would be responsible for debts owed to suppliers No direct access. There are conflicting reports about whether the Senate will take up the bill tomorrow de-linking the bonds from the DWR contracts and whether the Republicans will go along with it. In the Assembly: The Committee is hearing the Wright and Hertzberg bills as we speak, with Hertzberg's the likely winner. That bill now provides for Direct Access under certain conditions (the amendments describing the conditions were faxed today). We're attempting to get the ""July 12"" date changed to ""the effective date of the bill"" or later. The Assembly likely won't vote the Hertzberg bill out until tomorrow at the earliest. The Problem: The Assembly and Senate bills are diametrically opposed in the way each approaches the problem---in short, the bills are two ships passing in the night. The Democratic leaders (Governor, Hertzberg, Burton) aren't talking, and Burton hasn't expressed any interest in talking---to anybody. The likely outcome given the circumstances: Burton says he's done what he needs to do (i.e., passed out a ""fair"" bill); the Assembly and Senate can't agree; they finish the budget; time runs out; they leave Friday; and Edison's left twisting. That said, there's still a chance that the Governor could call Burton and sit down with Burton and Hertzberg and work something out by Friday, or begin talking and postpone the recess until they get it worked out. But given Burton, the chance of that happening seems very slim. In short, little has changed since yesterday. Best, Jeff

Ellen Wolf (of Tabors Caramanis) and I created this presentation building on previous presentations by Tim Belden and Dave Parquet. In the presentation and the meeting we made the following points: There isn't much FERC can do because the cause of the price spikes is not in the wholesale market. We discouraged FERC from taking any action that would hurt the vibrant wholesale market in the California and the rest of the West as well. High prices logically resulted from scarcity and if the Commission does anything it should (1) investigate whether market power was being exercised by any party and, (2) if necessary to protect the market (while still incenting needed generation) establish a price cap at a scarcity rent level equal to the price at which loads were willing to interrupt. The IOUs have not properly prepared for the risk of high prices caused by scarcity. They have failed to hedge and have underscheduled their load, therefore having to fill a large percentage of their load at ISO real time prices. My analogy was that this was like day trading your retirement fund as an asset allocation scheme. The market would function better if more information was provided to the market. The Commission should do whatever it can to incent participation by load. To see the presentation, detach, save, and view in Powerpoint. When you do, you will find there are many ""hidden"" slides that were not part of the oral presentation but were provided to Staff in hard copy for additional information. According to the head of the investigation (Scott Miller), the staff got alot more out of this meeting than Staff's previous meetings with the IOUs and the generators. Based on the numerous phone calls I've been getting, the Staff is looking into the data we provided. I have also attached a revised version of the presentation that Tim sent to Scott Miller on Friday. Tim's version conveys the same message but takes a different approach to conveying the message. On Friday, Tim talked to Scott and answered some additional questions. Tim said that Enron is in favor of eliminating the mandatory PX buying requirement and would like the IOUs to be able to buy from Enron Online. He also explained more fully the existence of scarcity .

 Capacity Options questions
Body:: Elizabeth, Jeff forwarded me your questions about capacity options. I've answered them to the extent they involve legal/regulatory issues. If you need anything further please don't hesitate to call. ? Can a new shipper who enters into an FTS-1 contract with zero MDQ in order to purchase a shipper call option or sell a transporter put option be allowed, prior to the exercise date, to transfer the underlying option rights by permanently releasing this contract? YES. ? Will we be required to report these contracts with zero MDQ on the Index of Customers and/or the Transactional Report? YES. ? Can the releasing shipper permanently release a portion of his existing MDQ and choose to keep or transfer the option rights? YES. The shipper could even release all of its MDQ (reducing it to zero) and keep its option rights. ? How is it determined whether a contract with an option amendment is within the min/max tariff rate or needs to be filed as a negotiated rate? The option fee is converted to a per-Dth, per day rate and added to the transport rate. If the total exceeds the maximum tariff rate, it's ""negotiated"". Otherwise, our position is that it's not negotiated. We are not 100% positive that FERC will agree with us on this issue.

Davis seems to continue to put distance between himself and the contracts. Best, Jeff Financial California Changes Stance on Refunds; Two Sides Far Apart In Energy Talks Peter Behr 07/06/2001 The Washington Post FINAL Page E01 Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity , saying they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43 billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year. Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term contracts, whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for Davis. ""We've made suggestions, we've offered various ways in which people could get us $8.9 billion,"" Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday. ""You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you want to do it, it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion."" The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr., according to sources close to the negotiations. Yesterday, Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach a compromise. ""What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood,"" Wagner told reporters. ""In the event we're unable to do that, [Friday] at some point I may offer a preliminary assessment."" The settlement conference is set to conclude on Monday. Wagner, FERC's chief administrative judge, has been trying to push both sides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy. Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California 's largest utility, drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on. Last Friday, Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative, Michael Kahn, chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in refunds from power generators and marketers was too high, sources said. Wagner's settlement conference, which has involved more than 100 lawyers for all sides, is closed to the public and media. Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda, and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a ""joke"" that the parties might as well wear ""clown suits,"" according to a Dow Jones report confirmed by sources close to the talks. But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers, led by Reliant Energy Inc., Williams Energy Services, Duke Energy and Southern Co., for failing to make serious settlement offers, these sources said. The suppliers have offered to refund $600 million, provided the state is able to call off various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds, sources said. Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds, but now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California 's electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher refund figure, some energy analysts believe. Davis's tactical change, offering to make the long-term contracts part of an overall settlement, comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have to pay for energy under those deals. California 's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed deregulation plan, which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at volatile ""spot market"" prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer, so did the state's electricity bills. In response, Davis's aide, S. David Freeman, and his staff began negotiating long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years. That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was paying at the beginning of this year, but above current power prices -- and considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade, energy analysts say. A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count as a ""refund"" because the deals were reached ""under commercial duress,"" according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations. Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify. ""There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be,"" said Michael Zenger, California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a ""just and reasonable"" standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit, the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure. ""It's not rocket science, but it does require the regulators to regulate,"" said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight committee for the California grid. Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room ""billions of dollars apart,"" as the talks approached their final weekend, sources said.

And Gov. Gray Davis announced a proposed=20 solution to one vexing problem: the utilities' failure to pay the state's= =20 small, alternative power generators, many of whom have stopped producing=20 power as a result. ?????Davis called the utilities ""shameful"" for failing to pay, and praised= =20 the alternative power generators, which include solar, wind and geothermal= =20 energy producers, as ""good corporate citizens"" who produced power although= =20 they weren't being paid. ?????""We are anxious to pay the [small producers], who are dropping like=20 flies,"" Davis said. ?????Despite the progress, it was hard for some people to look on the brigh= t=20 side after enduring outages that took place when the state's hunger for pow= er=20 was almost 50% less than at its summer peak. ?????""This is a taste, almost like an appetizer, of a really unpalatable me= al=20 that's going to be served up this summer,"" said Michael Shames of the Utili= ty=20 Consumers' Action Network in San Diego, himself a victim of a rolling=20 blackout that hit his office in San Diego early Tuesday. ?????Power officials have warned that this could be a grim summer in=20 California, since demand for electricity sharply rises when people turn on= =20 air conditioners. The state has been struggling to meet its power needs in= =20 recent months because of rising prices and a flawed deregulation plan that= =20 has left the two biggest private utilities on the brink of bankruptcy. Stat= e=20 leaders have so far failed to agree on a comprehensive plan to solve the=20 problems. Wally Quirk teaches a business class in a borrowed classroom Tuesday at=20 Sonoma State after the state's rolling blackouts cut the power to his usual= =20 classroom, which does not have any windows. SCOTT MANCHESTER / The Press Democrat ?????The latest round of blackouts began about 9:30 a.m. Tuesday when the= =20 California Independent System Operator, which runs the statewide grid,=20 determined that the demand for electricity was 500 megawatts more than the= =20 supply--an imbalance that meant the state was short on the power needed to= =20 supply electricity to about 375,000 homes. ?????Grid operators blamed a confluence of events, including warmer weather= ;=20 outages at several major power plants, including one unit of the San Onofre= =20 nuclear power station; a reduction in imports from the Pacific Northwest, a= nd=20 the shutdown of many alternative energy producers. Similar blackouts Monday= =20 were the first since January. ?????The situation improved somewhat by late Tuesday morning, with some=20 supplies restored and Californians conserving energy, and Cal-ISO was able = to=20 halt the rolling blackouts at 2 p.m. ?????Once again, customers of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power= =20 were spared, although the municipally owned utility said its electrical=20 surplus was smaller than usual. The DWP, like Southern California Edison, w= as=20 affected by an outage at the huge Mohave power plant in Nevada, as well as = by=20 planned outages at several of its facilities. ?????As in the past, by far the biggest impact was felt by customers served= =20 by Pacific Gas & Electric, the state's largest utility, which cut power to= =20 438,000 homes and businesses. ?????Edison cut power to 47,462 customers in about 40 cities, but eventuall= y=20 was able to avoid blackouts by shutting off the air conditioners of some of= =20 the 118,500 customers who participate in a voluntary cutoff program. ?????San Diego Gas & Electric cut power to 73,400 customers. ?????Innovative Ways of Coping ?????As on Monday, most people took the outages in stride, as an annoying b= ut=20 ultimately unavoidable inconvenience. ?????In Palmdale, four schools lost power during one of the hourlong=20 blackouts, but teachers and students pressed on in the sunlight pouring=20 through windows and skylights. At Barrel Springs Elementary, Principal Cruz= =20 Earls said the biggest problem came when students had to go to the bathroom= :=20 Hand in hand, they made their way through darkened hallways with flashlight= s. ?????All in all, it wasn't a terrible experience. Then again, the weather= =20 wasn't that hot Tuesday, with a high of 79 in Palmdale, so the shutdown of= =20 air conditioners wasn't much of a hardship. ""I don't want to think about th= e=20 conditions this could create in May or June,"" Earls said. ?????Businesses of all kinds complained about the lack of warning for the= =20 outages--and sometimes found innovative ways to get around the problem. ?????Rattled by news reports of Monday's rolling blackouts, El Burrito=20 Mexican Food Products in the city of Industry started its Tuesday shift at = 2=20 a.m. to beat the clock in the event of an outage. That hunch paid off.=20 Workers had just finished cooking and packaging the last batches of salsa a= nd=20 masa when the lights went out at 10:20 a.m. ?????Company owner Mark Roth said the firm will continue working odd hours = to=20 avoid further outages. But he isn't buying the line from the utilities that= =20 they can't provide advance warning because of concerns about looting and=20 rioting. ?????""We're ready to do whatever it takes to get through this thing,"" he=20 said. ""But they've got to give us some notification."" ?????At Big O Tires in Elk Grove, just south of Sacramento, owner Daniel Cr= um=20 had his 14 workers take an early lunch break or head to the warehouse to=20 reorganize the goods. Without electricity, they couldn't repair brakes or= =20 align front ends. ?????""I'd never let them be idle,"" said Crum. ?????At least two minor traffic accidents were blamed on the outages. ?????The blackouts resulted from a convergence of factors. ?????Demand was slightly higher than expected, probably because of=20 unseasonably warm weather. Supplies were tighter than usual, in part becaus= e=20 of several outages, including that at the Mohave plant, half of which was= =20 brought back on line by the end of the day. ?????The San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station was still limping along=20 without power from one of its two 1,100-megawatt units, which was shut down= =20 Feb. 3 after a half-hour fire in a nonnuclear part of the plant. Edison,=20 which operates San Onofre, initially estimated the unit would be out for=20 several weeks but recently said ""extensive damage"" to parts of the turbine= =20 will keep the unit out of commission until mid-June. ?????Shipments from the drought-stricken Pacific Northwest, which generates= =20 most of its electricity from large dams, were also down. ?????""Each time we take a measurement, we're closer to the all-time record= =20 for the driest year,"" said Dulcy Mahar, spokeswoman for the Bonneville Powe= r=20 Administration, the network of federal dams that provides the region with= =20 much of its electricity. ""We've been doing what we can, but we simply don't= =20 have power to sell."" ?????Finally, there was the problem of the small and alternative energy=20 producers, which have shut down plants because they haven't been paid by th= e=20 private utilities since November. Those outages have cost the state about= =20 3,000 megawatts of electricity, enough for about 2.3 million homes. ?????""You're seeing the system freeze up,"" said David Sokol, chairman and C= EO=20 of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co., which runs eight geothermal plants in t= he=20 Imperial Valley through its subsidiary, CalEnergy. His company hasn't shut= =20 down yet, but Sokol said smaller companies couldn't continue to sell their= =20 energy to utilities for free. ?????""Why should we fund Edison?"" he asked. ""That's just ridiculous."" ?????A Choice of 2 Rate Plans ?????Davis joined lawmakers in the Capitol on Tuesday to outline his plan t= o=20 get the producers running again. He said utilities have had no right to=20 collect money from ratepayers and then not use the funds to repay the small= =20 producers. The state has spent billions to buy power from large conventiona= l=20 producers on behalf of the utilities but has refused to pick up the tab for= =20 alternative energy. ?????""The utilities acted in a shameful manner by putting money in their=20 pockets that was designed to pay the [small producers],"" Davis said. ?????The plan outlined by Davis would allow the generators to choose betwee= n=20 two rate plans. They could decide to be paid 7.9 cents per kilowatt-hour ov= er=20 five years or 6.9 cents a kilowatt-hour over 10 years. ?????The utilities must begin paying the generators the new rates beginning= =20 April 1 or face fines, Davis said. ?????The question of how the companies will get paid the about $1.5 billion= =20 they are owed remains unresolved. That issue will be decided in coming week= s=20 as Davis' negotiators continue to work on rescue plans for the state's=20 financially hobbled private utilities. ?????PG&E spokesman Ron Low said the state's largest utility did not take= =20 kindly to Davis' criticism, and noted that the governor's plan is similar t= o=20 a proposal that PG&E made last week to producers. ?????Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of a trade group that includes so= me=20 of the small generators, described the plan as a positive step. ?????""The governor got it right in that it's not acceptable for small power= =20 producers to continue to generate and not be paid,"" Smutny-Jones said. ""But= =20 we'll need to see what the order says; the devil will truly be in the=20 details."" ?????Grid operators said the state's overall energy situation eased by midd= ay=20 Tuesday because of repairs at the Mohave plant and another large plant at= =20 Ormond Beach, and because the Western Area Power Administration came up wit= h=20 300 megawatts of electricity from Glen Canyon Dam. ?????Also, grid spokesman Patrick Dorinson said conservation savings spiked= =20 upward after earlier complaints that Californians weren't conserving. ?????""We saw the people of California probably conserve 900 megawatts today= ,""=20 he said.

In fact, they haven't. ?????More than anything, this week's events illustrate the delicate balance= =20 of factors that keep California illuminated, from the multitude of supply= =20 sources to the weather. ?????Temperatures were higher than usual.

To help officials predict available supply,=20 generators provide an annual maintenance plan that is updated regularly. ?????In addition, however, facilities sometimes shut down for unexpected=20 reasons: leaking tubes, burnt-out transformers, cracked turbines and faulty= =20 feed pumps. At one point Tuesday, about 8,200 megawatts were unavailable=20 because of unscheduled shutdowns. That's enough to supply about 6 million= =20 households, and up from 5,700 megawatts a week ago. ?????The huge 1,400-megawatt Mohave power plant near Laughlin, Nev., which= =20 supplies Southern California Edison and the Los Angeles Department of Water= =20 and Power, was felled Monday by a transformer problem.

Critic= s=20 renew call for full disclosure.=20 By DAN MORAIN , Times Staff Writer=20 ?????SACRAMENTO--As part of his closed-door negotiations to buy electricity= ,=20 Gov. Gray Davis has agreed to relieve some generators from having to pay=20 potentially millions of dollars in fees for emitting pollutants into the ai= r,=20 Davis said Tuesday. ?????Davis announced two weeks ago that his negotiators had reached deals= =20 with 20 generators to supply $43 billion worth of power during the next 10= =20 years. ?????However, the Democratic governor has refused to release any of the=20 contracts or detail various terms, contending that release of such=20 information would hamper the state's ability to negotiate deals with other= =20 generators and therefore ultimately would raise prices Californians pay for= =20 electricity. ?????Sources familiar with the negotiations, speaking on condition of=20 anonymity, said the agreement reached with Dynegy Inc., a power company bas= ed=20 in Houston, is one that includes language requiring that the state pay the= =20 cost of credits that allow emissions. Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel declin= ed=20 to discuss the company's deal with the state. ?????""We couldn't get them to sign contracts; it was a sticking point,"" Dav= is=20 said of the decision to pay the fees of some generators. ""We had to lock do= wn=20 some power so we were not totally dependent on the spot market."" ?????The fees in question are part of an emission trading system known as= =20 RECLAIM. Under the system, companies are allotted a certain amount of=20 allowable pollution. If their operations pollute more, companies are requir= ed=20 to purchase credits on an open market. Currently the credits cost about $45= =20 per pound of pollution--an amount that can lead to a bill of well over $10= =20 million a year for a power plant. ?????The South Coast Air Quality Management District, which regulates=20 pollution in the Los Angeles Basin, is considering steps to significantly= =20 lower the cost of the system--a step that could considerably cut the state'= s=20 potential cost, Davis said. ?????Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey)=20 defended the decision to cover the power company's costs. ?????""It is a question of whether it brings down the price of power,"" she= =20 said. ""If it brings down the price of power, I don't have a problem with it= ."" ?????Nevertheless, word that the contracts could bind the state to pay=20 pollution fees caused some critics of Davis' policy to renew calls for Davi= s=20 to reconsider the secrecy surrounding the power negotiations. The payment= =20 provision underscores the fact that the contracts involve more than merely= =20 the prices the state will pay for its megawatts, the critics note. ?????""The Legislature should have known about it,"" said Senate President Pr= o=20 Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco). ""It is going to cost taxpayers money. It= =20 makes you wonder. . . . This was a policy issue that was never discussed wi= th=20 the Legislature."" ?????V.

In such cases, some sources familiar with aspects of the=20 contracts said, the contract language could be interpreted to suggest that= =20 the state would cover any fines--although Davis said Tuesday the state will= =20 not cover the cost of fines. ?????A recent Dynegy filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission=20 underscores the rising cost of pollution-related measures.

Backup power will kick on emergency lights and allow th= e=20 cash registers to complete transactions. Employees are instructed to escort= =20 customers from the building safely, Levra said. ?????Other businesses, however, have plans to remain open during the 60- to= =20 90-minute blackouts. ?????When power went out at two Cheesecake Factory restaurants in Orange=20 County on Monday afternoon, the eateries switched to serving cold dishes su= ch=20 as sandwiches and salads, said Howard Gordon, senior vice president of the= =20 Calabasas Hills-based chain. ?????The restaurants had enough backup power to operate emergency lights an= d=20 cash registers.

But how likely is it that New Yorkers will face blackouts of the= =20 sort confronting Californians?=20 Not very, says energy trade specialist Edward Krapels, managing director of= =20 Boston-based METIS Trading Advisors. Krapels, a consultant helping major=20 Northeastern utilities, such as Consolidated Edison, design market-hedging= =20 programs, adamantly decried what he said are facile comparisons between=20 conditions in New York and California, there being ""more differences than= =20 there are similarities"" between those two industrial cornerstones of the=20 country's economy in respect to energy security management.=20 ""First of all, New York has a more varied portfolio of energy generation=20 sources than California,"" he said.

I am aware of several of these sales and have been informed that excess pressure at the border is the basic reason for them. I'd like a more specific explanation that includes the following information: 1. What are the specific pressures and volume considerations that could make it operationally necessary to sell gas at the California border? 2. What is the process that is followed to make such a determination? 3. Which individuals or groups are involved in determining whether an operational sale is necessary? 4. In what way have system operations changed since last year and how do those changes contribute to the increased frequency of such sales compared to previous years? 5. What alternatives to operational sales are considered before the decision to make a sale is reached? Thanks for your attention to this request. Please give me a call to discuss and please designate your response as ""Privileged and Confidential, Attorney Client Privileged.""

I attended a meeting this afternoon of the Coalition of Service Industries, one of the lead groups promoting a wide range of services including energy services in the upcoming WTO GATTS 2000 negotiations. CSI President Bob Vastine was in Delhi last week and met with CII to discuss the upcoming WTO. CII apparently has a committee looking into the WTO. Bob says that he told them that energy services was among the CSI recommendations and he recalls that CII said that they too have an interest. Since returning from the meeting I spoke with Kiran Pastricha and told her the above. She actually arranged the meeting in Delhi. She asked that I send her the packet of materials we distributed last week in Brussels and London. One of her associates is leaving for India tomorrow and will take one of these items to Delhi. Joe Joe Hillings 09/08/99 11:57 AM To: Sanjay cc: Terence H Ashok John Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES, Jeffrey Sherrick/Corp/Enron@Enron (bcc: Joe Hillings/Corp/Enron) Subject: India And The WTO Services Negotiation Sanjay: First some information and then a request for your advice and involvment. A group of US companies and associations formed the US WTO Energy Services Coalition in late May and has asked the US Government to include ""energy services"" on their proposed agenda when the first meeting of the WTO GATTS 2000 ministerial convenes late this year in Seattle. Ken Lay will be among the CEO speakers. These negotiations are expected to last three years and cover a range of subjects including agriculture, textiles, e-commerce, investment, etc. This morning I visited with Sudaker Rao at the Indian Embassy to tell him about our coalition and to seek his advice on possible interest of the GOI. After all, India is a leader in data processing matters and has other companies including ONGC that must be interested in exporting energy services. In fact probably Enron and other US companies may be engaging them in India and possibly abroad. Sudaker told me that the GOI has gone through various phases of opposing the services round to saying only agriculture to now who knows what. He agrees with the strategy of our US WTO Energy Services Coalition to work with companies and associations in asking them to contact their government to ask that energy services be on their list of agenda items. It would seem to me that India has such an interest. Sudaker and I agree that you are a key person to advise us and possibly to suggest to CII or others that they make such a pitch to the GOI Minister of Commerce. I will ask Lora to send you the packet of materials Chris Long and I distributed in Brussels and London last week. I gave these materials to Sudaker today. Everyone tells us that we need some developing countries with an interest in this issue. They may not know what we are doing and that they are likely to have an opportunity if energy services are ultimately negotiated. Please review and advise us how we should proceed. We do need to get something done in October. Joe PS Terry Thorn is moderating a panel on energy services at the upcoming World Services Congress in Atlanta. The Congress will cover many services issues. I have noted in their materials that Mr. Alliwalia is among the speakers but not on energy services. They expect people from all over the world to participate.

Subject:: Texas energy exec says, 'I told you'
Body:: Jeff FYI ?From the Contra Costa Times (East San Francisco Bay Area) Kevin Published Friday, June 22, 2001 Texas energy exec says, 'I told you' POWER CRISIS ? Enron's Skilling gets pied before his speech blaming lawmakers, but says he understands Californians' anger By Rick Jurgens TIMES STAFF WRITER SAN FRANCISCO -- A Texas energy executive who said his warnings were ignored by regulators who restructured California's electricity industry came to the Bay Area on Thursday to say, in effect, ""I told you so."" Jeffrey Skilling, chief executive of Houston-based Enron Corp., said that California wouldn't be in its current mess if regulators had followed his advice in 1994 and 1995. Regulators erred by forcing wholesale electricity transactions into the spot market so that deals could more easily be monitored, Skilling said in a speech to about 100 people at the Commonwealth Club of California. ""They created a flawed marketplace in the name of regulatory expediency."" Enron is a broker that buys and sells contracts to deliver power. Such bilateral transactions shouldn't have been banned, Skilling said. Skilling said that's what he said six years ago. ""I probably made a pest of myself (in the restructuring hearings called by regulators) because I told them they were doing it wrong,"" he said. ""They finally told me to keep quiet."" On Thursday night, it was Skilling's turn to be pestered. A woman threw a chocolate pie into his face before the event began. Police said Francine Cavanaugh of Oakland was arrested on suspicion of battery and released. Skilling tried to ignore protesters but said he understood why Californians, facing blackouts and rising power costs, were angry. He even had kind words for Gov. Gray Davis, who, he said, ""was dealt a very difficult hand."" Skilling became Enron's chief executive in February, replacing company founder Kenneth Lay, an early proponent of electricity deregulation who is close to President Bush. Enron, a global energy giant with roots in the natural gas industry, owns some power plants, but its influence in the electricity industry reflects the rapid growth of its energy trading operation. Enron's only California generators are small wind facilities. However, the company has developed power plants. Enron initiated two 750-megawatt projects that were sold to Calpine Corp., including a Pittsburg plant due to go online next month. Enron has announced plans to seek regulators' approval for a 750-megawatt power plant in Roseville in Placer County. During the first three months of 2001, Enron posted a huge jump in revenue, to $50.1 billion from $13.1 billion a year ago, but a much smaller gain in net income, to $425 million from $338 million. Skilling himself cashed an $850,000 paycheck and got a $5.6 million bonus last year. But the energy crisis has taken its toll on Enron's stock price and on Skilling, who owned or held options to buy 1.9 million shares of Enron common stock at the time of the company's February proxy filing. At Thursday's closing price of $44.05 a share, the stock was down more than 50 percent from its 52-week high of $90.75 in August. That proved that Enron wasn't the villain in California, Skilling said. ""This thing in California has been bad for everybody,"" he said. ""If we had anything to do with this, we're the stupidest people in the world.""

California is a perfect example: the market has responded to demand increases with thousands of megawatts of new generation, but state and local officials have not sited them, and companies like Enron are offering price protection, but utilities are not allowed to take advantage. ---------------------- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/HOU/EES on 08/14/2000 10:38 AM --------------------------- Gavin Dillingham@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 08/14/2000 08:32 AM To: Joe Hartsoe@ENRON, Sandra McCubbin@EES, Susan Mara@EES, Paul Kaufman@ECT, Karen Denne@ENRON, Jeff Dasovich@EES, Mark Palmer@ENRON, James D Steffes@EES, Steven J Kean@EES, Richard Shapiro@EES, Elizabeth Linnell@EES, Jeannie Mandelker@ECT, filuntz@aol.com cc: Subject: California Power Issue Attached is an article about deregulation, price volatility, California power issues and how EES and other energy management type of companies are helping with solve these problems. Attached is an article about how PG&E is offering incentives to its larger customers in California that which asks them to use less energy, in turn the customers are guaranteed to be blackout free. There is a little controversy over this issue because the incentive is not offered to small business or residents.

""We have done things to mitigate our exposure (to th= e=20 spot market).""=20 The credibility of the projections is crucial to the state's plan to sell $= 10=20 billion worth of bonds -- a key element of Davis' rescue plan.

That's money the Democratic governor proposed in=20 January would go to one-time expenditures on a variety of projects, from=20 clean beaches to housing, as well as new spending on schools.=20 The Republican plan calls for rate rebates for people whose electric=20 utilities are publicly owned, such as the Sacramento Municipal Utility=20 District. Some argue that these ratepayers are getting a bad deal because= =20 their tax money is subsidizing ratepayers whose utilities are in financial= =20 trouble.=20 It also includes past Republican proposals that have stagnated in the=20 Legislature, such as allowing residential customers to make deals with=20 independent electricity providers and encouraging quick building of power= =20 plants.=20 Although the Republicans are in the minority, they wield leverage in the=20 energy debate because a bill that would authorize a bond sale requires a=20 two-thirds vote. At least five of the 30 Assembly Republicans would have to= =20 vote for it.=20 The Republicans say they are uncomfortable with the size of the bond deal= =20 proposed by Davis, which combined with other energy bond sales could top $2= 0=20 billion.

Gray Davis= =20 into a dramatically different exit strategy for the energy crisis: writing= =20 off the $5 billion the state has already spent on electricity and borrowing= =20 billions less to finance future power purchases. ?????GOP lawmakers are holding up emergency legislation needed to replenish= =20 the budget for power costs, because they don't think the Democratic=20 governor's plan to get California out of the power business will work. They= =20 say the plan is full of dangerously optimistic assumptions, such as estimat= es=20 that 90% of the state's alternative energy producers will be generating=20 electricity this summer--only two-thirds are now--and that Californians wil= l=20 use 7% less electricity. ?????Although Republicans don't control either house, the emergency=20 legislation requires a two-thirds vote, which gives the GOP significant swa= y. ?????The plan from the Republican leadership would commit taxpayer money fo= r=20 the first time to an electricity problem that has only affected customers o= f=20 private utilities. Because the plan is sure to draw strong opposition from= =20 politicians in Los Angeles and other areas served by public power agencies,= =20 Republicans have included a complex, $1.5-billion proposal to provide refun= ds=20 to those served by municipal utilities. ?????By blocking the emergency legislation, Republicans may stop state=20 Treasurer Phil Angelides from securing a $4.13-billion loan to repay state= =20 coffers for electricity purchases--a failure that would reduce the money=20 available to Davis for his next budget and possibly delay his plan to resol= ve=20 the energy crisis. Angelides needs the bill to guarantee repayment for the= =20 loan. ?????If Angelides does not obtain legislative approval by Monday, he will= =20 miss a Tuesday deadline lenders had given him to close the loan. That would= =20 clearly leave Davis with less money for new education, police and=20 road-building programs as he begins planning his next budget this month. ?????Moreover, failure to pass the bill could delay a record bond issue tha= t=20 Davis promised would replenish the budget and shield it from further energy= =20 drains by summer. And it could harm sagging confidence on Wall Street that= =20 California can deliver on its plans to manage the energy crisis, Angelides= =20 said. ?????California's credit rating has already been downgraded by one credit= =20 agency, Standard & Poor's, largely because of concerns about the effect of= =20 electricity purchases on state finances. ?????Negotiations Are Continuing ?????""The Republicans appear to be digging in and playing a dangerous game = of=20 financial roulette with the state. This is really ludicrous to me,"" Angelid= es=20 said. ""Standard & Poor's has already downgraded us. The other credit rating= =20 agencies are watching. I just don't understand what the Republicans are=20 thinking."" ?????Said Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox (R-Fair Oaks): ""We're not=20 prepared to give the governor a blank check."" ?????Democrats threatened Thursday to test the Republicans' resolve by=20 bringing the bill to a vote in the Assembly, but backed down. Negotiations= =20 among legislative leaders continue. ?????To avoid widespread blackouts, the state government entered the=20 electricity-buying business in January after the private utilities became t= oo=20 burdened with debt to continue purchasing power on the expensive wholesale= =20 market. ?????Under a plan approved by the Legislature and signed into law by Davis,= =20 the state budget is to be repaid for the power purchases through a massive= =20 municipal bond issue, expected to be the largest in American history. The= =20 bonds, in turn, are to be paid off by utility ratepayers through a slice of= =20 their monthly bills. ?????However, the plan was based on the premise that the state would quickl= y=20 bring down power costs by entering into long-term contracts with suppliers-= -a=20 scenario that has yet to materialize. ?????In fact, California's power costs have gone up since January. Lawmaker= s=20 initially estimated that $10 billion in bonds would allow the budget to be= =20 repaid and cover future power purchases. Davis is now proposing $12.5 billi= on=20 in bonds--and higher electric bills--to finance the state's costs until 200= 3. ?????Republicans are convinced that it will not be enough. They say the=20 Angelides bridge loan is not needed because the state has money in various= =20 funds that could cover power purchases well into the fall. ?????They also confess to political considerations. Republican legislators= =20 believe that by allowing Angelides to obtain his loan now, they will be=20 powerless to oppose further borrowing later. The loan Angelides set up with= =20 J.P. Morgan Chase and several other financial services companies is to be= =20 repaid with the bond issue. If the loan is not repaid by the end of the=20 summer, the interest rate will rise dramatically, a situation that would ma= ke=20 it hard for the minority Republicans to oppose more bonds. ?????The strong GOP views were shaped in part by Democratic state Controlle= r=20 Kathleen Connell, who met with Republican legislators earlier this week and= =20 shared a highly critical appraisal of Davis' plan. ?????Connell told the Republicans that the governor's strategy was based on= a=20 series of assumptions about electricity market conditions in California thi= s=20 summer that, in her view, are highly improbable. ?????""It is almost impossible for all these hypothetical situations=20 envisioned in their scenario to occur at once,"" Connell said. ?????But even if all the assumptions came to pass, she predicted that=20 California would still need to secure another source of financing by next= =20 spring to continue energy purchases. Davis administration officials have=20 rebutted her claim. ?????""I am deeply troubled by this incremental approach to this financing= =20 that is long-term in nature and is going to burden the state for many years= ,""=20 Connell said, in what appeared to be a reference to Davis' reputation as a= =20 plodder.=20 ?????Using Surplus to Pay for Electricity ?????Republicans, who have traditionally been opposed to financing public= =20 programs with large bond issues, contend that Davis needs to reevaluate his= =20 plan. By proposing to essentially forget the $5 billion the state has spent= =20 so far on power, they are advocating using up the state's projected budget= =20 surplus on electricity costs, even if it means cutting new government=20 programs. ?????""If Gov. Davis continues down this path, he could bankrupt the state,""= =20 said Assemblyman Dennis Mountjoy (R-Monrovia). ""That would have a far great= er=20 impact on education."" ?????Democrats, who strongly believe that the surplus should be invested in= =20 roads, schools and to meet other long-term future needs, are unlikely to ev= er=20 support the idea. Lawmakers are already discussing outflanking the=20 Republicans by drafting a bill to repay the budget on a nonemergency basis,= =20 which would only require a majority vote. ?????That, however, would probably delay the financing until at least Augus= t,=20 since nonemergency measures do not take effect for 90 days--giving Californ= ia=20 only about six weeks to cut the largest municipal bond deal ever before sta= te=20 coffers begin to empty, according to Angelides. ?????There is another potential consequence: Many of the long-term contract= s=20 the Davis administration has reached to purchase electricity contain clause= s=20 that may make them void if the state does not obtain financing by July. ?????""This is a very dangerous game,"" Angelides said. ?????In other electricity developments Thursday: ?????* Over Republican objections, Democrats in the state Senate approved a= nd=20 sent to Davis a far-reaching bill that would put state government in the=20 business of operating its own power plants and selling electricity at cheap= er=20 rates than private companies. The bill, SB 6x by Senate leader John Burton= =20 (D-San Francisco), would create a state power authority with the ability to= =20 finance, buy, own and build generation plants and sell the energy at=20 cost-based rates. ?????on likened the proposed government body to the New York Power Authorit= y,=20 approved by GOP Gov.

PG&amp;E had asked the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles to overrule PUC decisions that the utility was not entitled to the money, which the utility spent buying electricity on the increasingly expensive wholesale market. In dismissing the lawsuit Wednesday, Judge Ronald S.W. Lew said ``PG&amp;E's claims are not yet ripe for review,'' meaning the case wasn't ready for trial. Steve Maviglio, spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, declared the decision a win for California ratepayers. ``PG&amp;E was banking on winning this case and using it as one of their excuses for not negotiating with the governor. It appears at least for now they failed,'' Maviglio said. But because the case was dismissed on procedural grounds rather than merit, PG&amp;E said the door was left open for the utility to refile its action once the commission makes final its interim orders on PG&amp;E's requested rate increase. ``The court determined that our lawsuit was premature because the CPUC had not yet finalized its various decisions on PG&amp;E's request for recovery of its costs to purchase wholesale power,'' PG&amp;E said in a statement. ``Today's action allows us to continue to pursue the merits of the case on a timely basis.'' A similar federal case filed by Southern California Edison is on hold, said company spokeswoman Clara Potes-Fellow. Edison, the state's second-largest utility, would drop that case as part of a rescue plan negotiated by Davis, which also includes the state buying the utility's transmission lines for $2.7 billion. Since last June, the two utilities say they have lost more than $14 billion. California's 1996 deregulation law froze electricity prices for customers of the state's three investor-owned utilities. When prices rose to record levels over the past year, PG&amp;E was unable to recoup the higher costs from its customers' bills. The undercollection, along with a failed deal to sell its transmission lines to the state, drove PG&amp;E to file for federal Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on April 6, the company argued. On Wednesday, the parent company, PG&amp;E Corp., reported a first-quarter loss of $951 million, or $2.62 per share. The first-quarter loss follows a fourth-quarter loss of $4.1 billion that also stemmed from continuing costs in California's power crisis. Bankruptcy Update/ PG&E Files Motion to Require CAISO to Follow Federal Law SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 3, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation - Pacific Gas and Electric Company has filed a motion in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court asking the court to direct the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) to comply with bankruptcy law, its Tariff, and a recent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) ruling, and stop billing the utility for wholesale power purchased. Pacific Gas and Electric Company's motion, which includes a request for a preliminary injunction, asks the court to enjoin the CAISO from requiring the utility to pay costs the CAISO has incurred and continues to incur to purchase wholesale power on its behalf, unless the utility can fully recover these costs. Bankruptcy law imposes an automatic stay to prevent parties from making certain claims or taking certain actions that would interfere with the estate or property of the estate of a Chapter 11 debtor. By purchasing power at costs higher than existing retail prices, and then sending the bill to the utility, the CAISO is violating the automatic stay provision and could be reducing the value of the company's assets by potentially hundreds of millions of dollars per month, depending on the average retail rate, the wholesale price, and the amount of power purchased by the CAISO. Recently, the CAISO sent Pacific Gas and Electric Company a bill for January and February spot market purchases that totaled nearly $1 billion. The action alleges that requiring the utility to pay more than it can collect in its existing generation-related rates would be improper under federal Bankruptcy Code because it is not in the best interest of the estate, would be an unauthorized post-petition use of Pacific Gas and Electric Company's property, and would force the utility to undertake credit on onerous terms. In addition, on April 6, 2001, FERC ordered the CAISO to comply with its February 14 order, in which FERC ordered that the CAISO could only buy power on behalf of creditworthy entities. Both Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Southern California Edison Company are no longer creditworthy companies. By continuing to purchase power on behalf of Pacific Gas and Electric Company, the CAISO is in violation of its own Tariff, FERC orders, and federal law.

The school is also happy and wants to strengthen its relationship with Enron. They had earlier this year contacted a Laura Kalmans, Director of Community Development at Enron, to discuss various ideas for cooperation with Enron that would strengthen our capacity in environmental matters and give the students exposure to real world issues, but nothing happened and they lost contact. They asked me who they should contact to find out how to pursue this and I said I thought it might be you or someone under you. They now want to send a letter to someone at Enron on this proposal. It is OK if it is addressed to you or should I tell them another name? Please advise me how to steer them in the right direction. Many thanks.

Thank you for generously offering to help us explore this connection. We believe there are strong synergies between Professor Bill Moomaw's International Environment and Resource Policy program and Enron's business model. There is currently a strong recruiting relationship between Enron and Fletcher; there are nine Fletcherites at Enron at this time. I'm confident that our strong recruiting relationship is a solid first step from which to launch an even stronger partnership. In order to explore expanding this relationship Ms. Elise Kalmans, Director of Community Development, agreed to arrange a meeting for Bill and me last spring. Unfortunately, the scheduling did not work out, and Ms. Kalmans then began a maternity leave so we had trouble identifying a new point of contact. I appreciate your suggestion that we aim to work through Stephen Kean. As Senior Vice President for Public and Environmental and Government Affairs, he does sound like the ideal contact with whom to discuss Professor Moomaw's program and its students. How do you suggest we proceed? Should we send a letter from Interim Dean Trachtman to ask if Mr. Kean would be willing to meet with Professor Moomaw? May I mention that you suggested we write him? At Betsy's suggestion, I have attached the presentation outline we prepared for Enron, along with the letter we originally mailed to Elise. I would be very interested in any suggestions you may have. If you have any trouble opening the powerpoint file or word document, please let me know and I would be happy to mail or fax them. Thank you again for your kind offer of assistance.

Back to story Most of West in the Same Power Jam as California Utilities: Other states ran their grids at fever pitches as populations swelled and few new energy sources were developed. Now, also facing blackouts, they want to tilt balance of power away from the Golden State and toward themselves. By PETER G. GOSSELIN, Times Staff Writer WINTERSBURG, Ariz.--For more than a century, California ran a simple account with the rest of the West: It demanded and the West supplied, most especially water and power. But as the Western states have ballooned in the last decade--in no small part because of an outbound trek of Californians--this simple, supply-demand relationship has broken down. Fundamentally, the rest of the West has outgrown its electrical system just as California has its own. And it has done so in very much the same way--by adding too many people without enough new power or conservation. Indeed, statistics show that much of the rest of the West would have been on the verge of trouble even without California's help and may yet face the sort of rolling blackouts that have wreaked so much havoc in the Golden State. The booming Southwest has run its power grid at such a fever pitch that its planning reserves--the extra power that utilities build in to handle emergencies--have shrunk to levels that many regulators and industry experts consider dangerous. Almost none of the West save Montana has increased its power production at anything like the pace of its population growth during the last decade. Despite the long economic boom of the 1990s, which smiled especially on the West, several, such as Arizona, have failed to complete a single new power plant. ""We don't know how bad it's going to be yet,"" said Utah's Republican governor, Mike Leavitt. ""We won't know that until May, June, July and August, when everyone in the Southwest turns on their swamp coolers."" In trying to dodge the blackout bullet, many Western leaders are seeking to force a great change on the region: to renegotiate their states' basic deal with California. They want to end an old relationship--that between center and hinterland, colonizer and colonized--and establish a new one that could curtail California's long regional dominance. In the strange chemistry of the moment--when a once-Republican state government has turned Democratic and a once-Democratic national government has turned Republican, when the battle is to a large extent over privately owned electricity rather than publicly controlled water--they could actually meet with some success. ""California spent the 20th century decolonizing itself from Wall Street and the East,"" said Kevin Starr, the state librarian and author of a multivolume history of California. ""Now, all of a sudden, there's a dramatic possibility of it being recolonized, at least in part, by the rest of the West."" Captive Plants Feed Power to California Ground zero for these changes lies 50 miles west of Phoenix in the dry scrublands of Wintersburg. This is home to the Palo Verde nuclear facility, now the nation's single biggest power producer. It will soon be home as well to between three and six new gas-fired power plants that, combined, will produce even more electricity than their giant neighbor. Palo Verde represents a great deal about the old, fraying world of regulated utilities and about the supply-demand relationships that California once maintained with the rest of the West. More than one-quarter of the plant is owned by Los Angeles' municipal utility, the Department of Water and Power, several other California cities and Southern California Edison. A row of steel latticework towers runs off toward California, carrying a transmission line from plant to consumer. California has big stakes in a half-dozen similarly captive plants in an arc of states from Nevada to New Mexico. From California's point of view, the beauty of these projects has been that they provided near-certain power without the muss of meeting state pollution standards or the political hassle of building closer to home. And at least until the mid-1990s, California regulators virtually guaranteed that their owners covered their costs and made profits, even if plants' power wasn't immediately needed. ""The first principle of the old system was that you had to be able to meet demand, no matter what,"" said Paul L. Joskow, a veteran utility economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""If you had too much power, if it cost you a little too much, that was less important than being sure you could meet demand."" And, he added, ""you had regulators watching to make sure you did."" The gas-fired plants that are about to pop up in Wintersburg are also representative, but of the new, deregulated world of power production. Although they will crowd in around Palo Verde and tap into the same California transmission line, they are being built on an entirely different business premise: selling power to the highest bidder. In fact, the reason this empty patch of desert has become such an electricity hot spot lately is not Palo Verde itself, but its huge transmission lines. In addition to the California line, four others fan out from the plant: two back to Phoenix, one east to New Mexico, and one north to Utah and from there to the Northwest. All were built to hard-wire the nuclear project to its owners. But they are now seen as the means by which a new breed of producer can get top dollar by sending power wherever prices are highest. ""It used to be generating capacity was built by people who looked at the market to see if they could meet demand,"" said Jack Davis, president of Pinnacle West Capital Corp., which owns Arizona's major utility and is putting up two of the Wintersburg plants. ""Now,"" he said approvingly, ""it's being built by people who look at the market to see if you can make a lot of money."" Plans Go Awry in Many States Money, not the watchful eye of government, was what was supposed to assure that electricity deregulation worked. The opportunity to make it would cause investors to flock to the electricity business, ensuring that plenty of new power plants got built. If too many went up, it would be investors, not ratepayers, who suffered. If too few, then high prices would attract still more investors, more plants and, ultimately, more power. But to date, almost nothing about deregulation has gone as planned--and not just in California, but in the West in general. Take Arizona. The state has a hands-off attitude toward business, including its utilities. It has almost none of the environmental restrictions blamed for keeping California from putting up the new plants it needs. Its population grew by 40% from 1990 to 2000, according to the Census Bureau. And its demand for electricity expanded at nearly twice that rate, according to industry figures. ""Arizona should have been a power producer's heaven,"" said A. Michael Schaal, a senior analyst with Energy Ventures Analysis Inc., a prominent Washington-area consulting firm. But Arizona's power production rose a mere 4% during the 1990s, mostly as a result of improving existing plants. Until 18 months ago, no one had applied to build a major power plant since Palo Verde in the late 1980s. ""I guess I go on the assumption that the utilities plan with some sort of 10-, 20-, 30-year time horizon,"" Arizona's Republican Gov. Jane Dee Hull said in a recent interview. ""I think what we all worry about is: Are they planning?"" Or Nevada. Its utilities apparently did plan and increased electricity-making capacity between 1990 and 2000 by a substantial 44%. But that wasn't enough to keep up with the state's population, which increased 66%. On Thursday, Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn, a Republican and former energy company executive, indefinitely halted deregulation in his state. Or traditionally energy-rich Washington state. One of its major utilities, Seattle City Light, recently learned that all of its previously planned supply increase for the next four years will be consumed, and then some, by just three new customers: computer server farms being built to handle the growing Internet traffic in and out of the high-tech capital. But it's unlikely to be able to get extra power soon because regional supplies are balanced on a ""razor's edge,"" according to Northwest Power Pool President Jerry Rust. ""We have no cushion."" Indeed, the electricity supplies of the entire West are balanced on a razor's edge, with a variety of forecasters predicting serious shortages this summer. Schaal, the Washington-area consultant, for example, said the region will come up 6% short. ""Westerners can expect 150 to 275 hours of rolling blackouts, most of them in California,"" he said. One of the most striking aspects of the current situation is that, in contrast to what most people think, supplies have not grown short just recently. They have been perilously tight for the last several years--before the start of California's troubles of this summer and fall, and before the near-record dry winter that has left the Northwest dangerously short of water for its hydroelectric dams. The implication is that California did not cause other states to run short of power so much as trigger events that exposed their danger. It did that, according to key observers, with one monumentally inept maneuver. When California required its major utilities to buy power in the volatile spot market and simultaneously prohibited them from passing along higher costs to consumers, it set off a furious price spiral. That effectively stripped the entire region of its energy security blanket, the assurance that it could buy extra power relatively inexpensively if local supplies proved inadequate. The result has been a string of crises across the West. In southern Arizona, for example, the San Carlos Irrigation Project, a tiny public utility that tried to jump into the deregulation vanguard by dropping long-term contracts in hopes of more power at lower prices in the spot market, has announced that its bills are going up 300%. Most of the project's 13,300 poor customers say they can't pay. In Phoenix, utility executives who had confidently said the state was rich with new power projects about to come on line have decided to pull two 50-year-old steam plants out of mothballs and rent a pair of portable generators to reduce purchases from the expensive spot market. In Idaho, the big power company is appealing to potato farmers to skip planting and sell the electricity they would use running irrigation pumps back to the firm. Company executives figure the buyback will be cheaper than purchasing power on the open market--and the potato farmers are likely to do pretty well themselves. Deep Hostility in Rest of the West The subtle difference between California's triggering recent events and actually causing the region's crisis is largely lost in the current atmosphere of apprehension and upheaval. Although leaders of the rest of the West are scrupulously evenhanded in commenting to outsiders about their big neighbor, they are less guarded at home. The normally mild-mannered Leavitt, for example, was recently quoted as warning a Salt Lake City audience that ""California, if given the chance, would put a shunt into our veins and bleed us pretty quickly."" (In an interview, he denied having made the remark.) Such comments reflect an old and easily rekindled view among Westerners that their states are, in the words of historian Bernard DeVoto, ""plundered provinces""--terrain that first Easterners and then Californians have regularly raided for minerals, water and, most recently, power. But this time, some Western leaders think they can change all this. ""A lot of people see an opportunity to rewrite the fundamental relationship with California to their advantage,"" said Stanford historian Richard White. The attempts at rewriting are taking shape across the West. In the Northwest, Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Montana are redoubling their efforts to take over the Bonneville Power Administration, the huge, federally controlled generating system on the Columbia and Snake rivers that is one of California's chief sources of summer electricity. ""The crisis has highlighted the danger that power generated in the region can be exported without the region's consent,"" Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber said in an interview. In Arizona, state officials have gone from having no proposals for new power plants to being buried by them. Regulators recently approved the construction of 10 plants, including several around Palo Verde, and are considering another eight. Although they are requiring the plants to temporarily serve Arizona's needs first, the facilities will soon be able to sell their power for whatever prices they can command, an arrangement that could leave California just one among many bidders. (Federal officials are unlikely to get in the way: Gov. Hull is close to President Bush, who in turn has shown little interest in helping Democratic California.) Perhaps the most aggressive efforts at change are occurring in Utah, where Leavitt is trying something that could become California's worst nightmare--recalling power that Utah produces for the state. Los Angeles' DWP and several other California utilities own three-quarters of the huge, coal-fired Intermountain Power Project in west-central Utah, and have been drawing on it without incident for 15 years. But Utah officials recently unearthed a long-forgotten provision in their agreement with the plant's owners that gives them the right, with proper notice, to recall power for local use. The state has already notified Los Angeles that it is taking back 50 megawatts of electricity capacity this summer and another 170 next summer, and it may be able to take back still more, according to plant general manager Reed Searle. Although the amounts are trivial--the Los Angeles utility either owns or has firm contracts for more than 7,000 megawatts of capacity--Leavitt said Utah will demand similar recall provisions in agreements for any new plants in the state, including a 500- to 750-megawatt facility that Los Angeles is negotiating to build. ""California has chosen not to create its own power generation and has depended on us to do that,"" the Utah governor said. ""That's fine and we're willing to do that. ""But,"" he added, ""there comes a point at which, if demand grows too large, we've got to hold some of this capacity back for ourselves, and for our children and grandchildren."" If Utah and the rest of the West have reached that point, California could be in for a much bigger and more enduring shock than the one from which it now suffers. --- Times researcher Lynn Marshall in Seattle contributed to this report.

Lying in the weeds may be a more prudent course of action. >>> ""Fergus, Gary S."" <GFergus@brobeck.com> 11/07/00 10:08PM >>> I just spoke with Mary to make sure we have the same information. Here are the facts we have so far. On November 4th, the CPUC filed a motion with FERC to adopt the form of protective order that the CPUC entered, to compel the production of documents and to shorten time to answer. According to Exhibit B (read to me by Nancy Pickover at Bracewell) the following CPUC moved against the following entities: AES, Williams, Duke, Dynegy, Reliant and Southern. Enron entities were NOT named in exhibit B. This is not to say that we could not be easily added to the group. While the motion reads as if the CPUC was moving against everybody, in fact, in footnote 2 they state they are only moving against the entities named in Exhibit B. We will have Exhibit B in hand first thing tomorrow via FEDEX to confirm this. To repeat, Enron is not named yet.

Given the timing, we should discuss this on our conference call scheduled for tomorrow. They request that we be required: to answer their motion on Thursday, to provide the information within 5 working days of a FERC ordering production, and to provide of P&L information and spread sheets detailing our deals, specifically delivery point, delivery date, counterparty, volume and price. We may not have a problem providing this information for use by FERC in its proceeding subject to a confidentiality agreement but I think we would oppose their requests for: the information to be provided for ""government eyes only"" - this would prohibit EPMI from defending itself vis-a-vis other market participants. a FERC confidentiality order that would could allow FERC to ""share"" this information with the CPUC (for purposes of the PUC's OII proceeding) pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 824h(c). 16 USC 824g(c) requires the Commission to make information available to state commissions as may be of assistance in state regulation of public utilities. We should argue that 16 USC 824h(c) does not apply here given that we are not a public utility nor does the PUC regulate how much market power wholesale marketers exercise or the level of market power mitigation (these are the bases the PUC provides for explaining why it should have this information.) the above contractual information to allow them to analyze the competitiveness of the forward market to evaluate the wisdom of the Commission's decision to allow the UDC's ""unfettered access"" to the forwards market. This argument is unpersuasive given that the CPUC can get information about the competitiveness of the forward markets from the Wall Street Journal's listing of NYMEX prices.

We anticipate that we will use gas, but in either case, we will not pass the emmissions threshold. Obviously diesel will provide less generation. Enron currently has a gas compressor on site and we own the land. We are seeking to deliver the power to markets in the west. This will serve the Palo Verde region. Jim Steffes has been advising as to the local permitting processes. I will keep you in the loop as we proceed. We will probably look to permit other such generation facilities in the west.

Subject:: Update on House RTO Activities
Body:: There are now two House hearnigs tomorrow, not just one. In the morning, there is a panel on reliability, siting and incentive pricing for transmission. Jim Steffes is the EPSA witness. The RTO-related hearing, originally scheduled on a separate day, will be in the afternoon tomorrow. Peter Esposito of Dynegy is the expected EPSA witness. I am checking on the final list of other panelists and will advise. Finally, Andy Black of Chairman Barton's staff advises that they will release draft RTO language as early as today. We expect that this draft will not be to our liking. Barton thinks FERC is moving too quickly and with too much force. We expect his proposal to set a deadline of something like 12 months for utilities to join an RTO. The key is in part whether he allows FERC to continue to decide what constitutes an acceptable RTO or whether he will try to ""grandfather"" in some fashion those RTOs that have been proposed by utilities to date.

Body:: Vince, I agree with you that it's a lesson people need to learn over and over again. I can't tell you how many politicians I met over the past year who really don't like markets and certainly don't understand how or why they work. These aren't just the minor leaguers in Sacramento, but the big league players in Washington. I also agree that the academic community can play ""an important role in shaping public opinion and in explaining the logic of deregulation process."" I'd like to think that is in large part what I have been trying to do. Frank

Body:: Currently an announcement is scheduled for mid may so there may be more public information available then. In the meantime, I would answer the question as follows: Enron will continue to focus its attention on the commercial, light manufacturing and industrial end user markets. Enron continues to explore opportunities to serve the residential market and we believe that the market presents opportunities that were not available even a couple of years ago (for example, the rising acceptance of online purchasing by consumers presents low cost customer acquisition and account management possibilities that didn't exist when Enron last moved into residential markets). We believe, however, that the residential market opportunity is best pursued through a separate entity outside of Enron Mary Clark@ENRON 04/20/2000 02:31 PM To: Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES, Maureen McVicker/HOU/EES@EES cc: Subject: Annual Meeting Q&A Steve, we need to include a potential question in the Q&A document that addresses if Enron will get back into the residential business (i.e. Resco). Could you provide an answer to this question. I need by end of biz Monday. Thanks. Mary

And Gov.

SCOTT MANCHESTER / The Press Democrat ?????The latest round of blackouts began about 9:30 a.m. Tuesday when the= =20 California Independent System Operator, which runs the statewide grid,=20 determined that the demand for electricity was 500 megawatts more than the= =20 supply--an imbalance that meant the state was short on the power needed to= =20 supply electricity to about 375,000 homes. ?????Grid operators blamed a confluence of events, including warmer weather= ;=20 outages at several major power plants, including one unit of the San Onofre= =20 nuclear power station; a reduction in imports from the Pacific Northwest, a= nd=20 the shutdown of many alternative energy producers. Similar blackouts Monday= =20 were the first since January. ?????The situation improved somewhat by late Tuesday morning, with some=20 supplies restored and Californians conserving energy, and Cal-ISO was able = to=20 halt the rolling blackouts at 2 p.m. ?????Once again, customers of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power= =20 were spared, although the municipally owned utility said its electrical=20 surplus was smaller than usual. The DWP, like Southern California Edison, w= as=20 affected by an outage at the huge Mohave power plant in Nevada, as well as = by=20 planned outages at several of its facilities. ?????As in the past, by far the biggest impact was felt by customers served= =20 by Pacific Gas & Electric, the state's largest utility, which cut power to= =20 438,000 homes and businesses. ?????Edison cut power to 47,462 customers in about 40 cities, but eventuall= y=20 was able to avoid blackouts by shutting off the air conditioners of some of= =20 the 118,500 customers who participate in a voluntary cutoff program. ?????San Diego Gas & Electric cut power to 73,400 customers. ?????Innovative Ways of Coping ?????As on Monday, most people took the outages in stride, as an annoying b= ut=20 ultimately unavoidable inconvenience. ?????In Palmdale, four schools lost power during one of the hourlong=20 blackouts, but teachers and students pressed on in the sunlight pouring=20 through windows and skylights. At Barrel Springs Elementary, Principal Cruz= =20 Earls said the biggest problem came when students had to go to the bathroom= :=20 Hand in hand, they made their way through darkened hallways with flashlight= s. ?????All in all, it wasn't a terrible experience. Then again, the weather= =20 wasn't that hot Tuesday, with a high of 79 in Palmdale, so the shutdown of= =20 air conditioners wasn't much of a hardship. ""I don't want to think about th= e=20 conditions this could create in May or June,"" Earls said. ?????Businesses of all kinds complained about the lack of warning for the= =20 outages--and sometimes found innovative ways to get around the problem. ?????Rattled by news reports of Monday's rolling blackouts, El Burrito=20 Mexican Food Products in the city of Industry started its Tuesday shift at = 2=20 a.m. to beat the clock in the event of an outage. That hunch paid off.=20 Workers had just finished cooking and packaging the last batches of salsa a= nd=20 masa when the lights went out at 10:20 a.m. ?????Company owner Mark Roth said the firm will continue working odd hours = to=20 avoid further outages. But he isn't buying the line from the utilities that= =20 they can't provide advance warning because of concerns about looting and=20 rioting. ?????""We're ready to do whatever it takes to get through this thing,"" he=20 said. ""But they've got to give us some notification."" ?????At Big O Tires in Elk Grove, just south of Sacramento, owner Daniel Cr= um=20 had his 14 workers take an early lunch break or head to the warehouse to=20 reorganize the goods. Without electricity, they couldn't repair brakes or= =20 align front ends. ?????""I'd never let them be idle,"" said Crum. ?????At least two minor traffic accidents were blamed on the outages. ?????The blackouts resulted from a convergence of factors. ?????Demand was slightly higher than expected, probably because of=20 unseasonably warm weather. Supplies were tighter than usual, in part becaus= e=20 of several outages, including that at the Mohave plant, half of which was= =20 brought back on line by the end of the day. ?????The San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station was still limping along=20 without power from one of its two 1,100-megawatt units, which was shut down= =20 Feb. 3 after a half-hour fire in a nonnuclear part of the plant. Edison,=20 which operates San Onofre, initially estimated the unit would be out for=20 several weeks but recently said ""extensive damage"" to parts of the turbine= =20 will keep the unit out of commission until mid-June. ?????Shipments from the drought-stricken Pacific Northwest, which generates= =20 most of its electricity from large dams, were also down. ?????""Each time we take a measurement, we're closer to the all-time record= =20 for the driest year,"" said Dulcy Mahar, spokeswoman for the Bonneville Powe= r=20 Administration, the network of federal dams that provides the region with= =20 much of its electricity. ""We've been doing what we can, but we simply don't= =20 have power to sell."" ?????Finally, there was the problem of the small and alternative energy=20 producers, which have shut down plants because they haven't been paid by th= e=20 private utilities since November. Those outages have cost the state about= =20 3,000 megawatts of electricity, enough for about 2.3 million homes. ?????""You're seeing the system freeze up,"" said David Sokol, chairman and C= EO=20 of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co., which runs eight geothermal plants in t= he=20 Imperial Valley through its subsidiary, CalEnergy. His company hasn't shut= =20 down yet, but Sokol said smaller companies couldn't continue to sell their= =20 energy to utilities for free. ?????""Why should we fund Edison?"" he asked. ""That's just ridiculous."" ?????A Choice of 2 Rate Plans ?????Davis joined lawmakers in the Capitol on Tuesday to outline his plan t= o=20 get the producers running again. He said utilities have had no right to=20 collect money from ratepayers and then not use the funds to repay the small= =20 producers. The state has spent billions to buy power from large conventiona= l=20 producers on behalf of the utilities but has refused to pick up the tab for= =20 alternative energy. ?????""The utilities acted in a shameful manner by putting money in their=20 pockets that was designed to pay the [small producers],"" Davis said. ?????The plan outlined by Davis would allow the generators to choose betwee= n=20 two rate plans. They could decide to be paid 7.9 cents per kilowatt-hour ov= er=20 five years or 6.9 cents a kilowatt-hour over 10 years. ?????The utilities must begin paying the generators the new rates beginning= =20 April 1 or face fines, Davis said. ?????The question of how the companies will get paid the about $1.5 billion= =20 they are owed remains unresolved.

PG&E, which has more debt than Edison, says its=20 transmission lines are more extensive than those of its Southern California= =20 counterpart. ?????The state wants to buy the utilities' transmission lines and other=20 assets for about $7 billion to provide cash to the utilities, help stabiliz= e=20 the electricity supply and ease the power crunch that has plagued Californi= a=20 for months. To research the grid purchase, Fichera said, the state has had = to=20 pore over 80,000 documents just to assess the utilities' liabilities. ?????""We are working at a good pace,"" said Fichera, chief executive of the= =20 New York firm Saber Partners. "" . . . If we get to a deal-breaker, it might= =20 be longer."" ?????By making Fichera, who is also a consultant to the Texas Public=20 Utilities Commission, available to reporters Tuesday, the Davis=20 administration was clearly trying to reassure the public that progress is= =20 being made on the governor's plan to pull the state out of the crisis. ?????Since mid-January, when the big utilities' credit failed and suppliers= =20 stopped selling to them, the state has spent nearly $3 billion buying=20 electricity from a handful of large suppliers in Texas, Oklahoma, Georgia a= nd=20 North Carolina. Not a cent has gone to the hundreds of alternative energy= =20 suppliers in California who provide about a quarter of the state's=20 electricity. ?????The Monday and Tuesday blackouts occurred partly because many of the= =20 cash-strapped alternative suppliers, including solar, biomass and wind powe= r=20 units, cut their normal supply to the system in half. They say Edison and= =20 PG&E have not paid them since November; the utilities say they are out of= =20 cash. ?????Assemblyman Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek) said the plight of the=20 alternative suppliers has dragged on because of the complexity of dealing= =20 with ""almost 700 individual contractors."" ?????Another delaying factor, said Keeley, who with state Sen. Jim Battin= =20 (R-La Quinta) worked for almost three months to come up with a legislative= =20 plan to lower the small producers' prices, was ""the huge enmity . . .=20 manifested between the utilities and the qualifying facilities.

The administration says it has= =20 concluded 40 contracts with generators, about half of which have been signe= d. ?????According to the most recent statistics released by the Department of= =20 Water Resources, which buys power for the state, current prices are still= =20 well above the rate state Treasurer Phil Angelides says is necessary for a= =20 planned $10-billion bond offering to succeed. ?????The bonds, set for sale in May, will be used to reimburse the state fo= r=20 the money it will have spent by that time to buy electricity. The state is= =20 currently spending at a rate of $58 million a day to buy power. If prices= =20 stay high, the $10 billion in bonds will not cover the state's power=20 purchases by the end of the summer. ?????Angelides says he cannot proceed with bridge financing for the bonds= =20 until the Public Utilities Commission devises a formula to guarantee that a= =20 portion of utility bills will be dedicated to bond repayment. Angelides has= =20 estimated that, under the January law that put the state in the power buyin= g=20 business, the state must be reimbursed $2.5 billion annually, and that $1.3= =20 billion is needed to service the debt. ?????PUC Administrative Law Judge Joseph R. DeUlloa is expected to announce= =20 his ruling on the reimbursement rate later this week, leading to a PUC vote= =20 on the matter as early as next week. ?????* The rates charged for electricity by the alternative producers, know= n=20 as qualifying facilities, must be cut at least in half, down from an averag= e=20 of more than 17 cents per kilowatt-hour. In his news conference Tuesday,=20 Davis said he will ask the PUC to set QF rates at 6.9 cents for 10-year=20 contracts and 7.5 cents for five-year contracts. ?????Meanwhile, PUC Chairman Loretta Lynch, a Davis appointee, said Tuesday= =20 that the commission will vote next week on a proposed order requiring=20 Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric to pay the QFs for=20 electricity in the future. Lynch said a recent PUC assessment showed that t= he=20 utilities have enough cash on hand for that. ?????""We are trying to make sure the folks providing the power get paid,""= =20 Lynch said. ""The qualified facilities have demonstrated that they haven't= =20 been paid and that it is impairing their ability to provide power."" ?????The utilities contend that if they pay the small providers what they o= we=20 them, there will not be enough money left to pay other creditors. ?????""There is not enough money in the current rate structure to pay the=20 [alternative producers], pay the [Department of Water Resources] and pay th= e=20 utilities for their generation,"" said John Nelson, a spokesman for PG&E. ?????* The utilities must sell to the state the power they produce=20 themselves, mainly from hydro and nuclear sources, at a rate only slightly= =20 above the cost of producing it.

Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel declin= ed=20 to discuss the company's deal with the state. ?????""We couldn't get them to sign contracts; it was a sticking point,"" Dav= is=20 said of the decision to pay the fees of some generators. ""We had to lock do= wn=20 some power so we were not totally dependent on the spot market."" ?????The fees in question are part of an emission trading system known as= =20 RECLAIM. Under the system, companies are allotted a certain amount of=20 allowable pollution. If their operations pollute more, companies are requir= ed=20 to purchase credits on an open market. Currently the credits cost about $45= =20 per pound of pollution--an amount that can lead to a bill of well over $10= =20 million a year for a power plant. ?????The South Coast Air Quality Management District, which regulates=20 pollution in the Los Angeles Basin, is considering steps to significantly= =20 lower the cost of the system--a step that could considerably cut the state'= s=20 potential cost, Davis said. ?????Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey)=20 defended the decision to cover the power company's costs. ?????""It is a question of whether it brings down the price of power,"" she= =20 said.

In such cases, some sources familiar with aspects of the=20 contracts said, the contract language could be interpreted to suggest that= =20 the state would cover any fines--although Davis said Tuesday the state will= =20 not cover the cost of fines. ?????A recent Dynegy filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission=20 underscores the rising cost of pollution-related measures.

This action comes only a day before FERC and other witnesses will testify on the Feinstein/Smith price cap legislation before the Senate Energy Committee, Gov. Davis and FERC will testify before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee on Wednesday, and the House Financial Services Committee joins the fray with a hearing on the California energy situation on Wednesday. The latter committee will probably base its jurisdiction over some aspect of energy policy on a number of factors, including its jurisdiction over presidential economic emergency powers. The committee staff has in the past expressed interest in derivatives and other financial aspects of energy trading and markets. We are checking now to quietly determine whether these issues will be on Wednesday's agenda.

Learn more about SCIENTECH'S InfoGrids at: SCIENTECH IssueAlert, October 6, 2000 Calling All Investors: The New Power Company's IPO Priced at $21 Per Share By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis TNPC, Inc., parent of The New Power Company, announced yesterday that its initial public offering (IPO) of 24 million common shares was priced at $21 per share. The stock closed yesterday at $27 per share. The Company expects to receive net proceeds from the offering of its shares at=20 approximately $473 million, exclusive of the underwriters' option to purchase an addition= al 3,600,000 common shares to cover over allotments. TNPC, Inc.=01*a partnersh= ip between Enron, America Online (AOL) and IBM=01*was formed in late 1999 to provide electricity and natural gas directly to households and small=20 businesses in the deregulated energy marketplace. TNPC's shares will be listed on the NYSE under the symbol NPW. Closing of the offering is expected to occur Oct. 11. ANALYSIS: I am sure that many eyebrows were raised when TNPC issued the IPO of its stock at $21, a figure that seemed surprisingly high for a start= -up company that has been in operation only since early summer. It is rather mind-boggling that a company with no significant track record could open its stock at such a price, but it is not unheard of. In fact, TNPC is=20 following a trend of new Internet companies initiating IPOs that are supported by grand concepts rather than tangible success. However, the TNPC ""dream team"" alliance between Enron, AOL and IBM has been met with great expectations (and a lot of skepticism as well) throughout the industry. I read through the S-1/A filing that TNPC submitted to the SEC, so hopefull= y I can cut through the hype regarding this deal to get to its nucleus. First= , TNPC acknowledges repeatedly throughout its filing that it is entering into an extremely high-risk venture, and in fact will ""incur substantial operating and net losses, and cannot assure that we will attain=20 profitability."" Further, TNPC admits that it expects to incur these losses for a=20 ""significant,"" but undetermined, period of time. Why, then, would Wall Street be greeting this IPO with such a positive welcome? One could easily argue that the sheer market presence of Enron, AOL and IBM has by association driven up the value of TNPC, but I think a deeper answer lies within several factors. First, TNPC has been bankrolled by some hefty investments. In two separate, private placements, investors such as Enron, GE Capital Equity Investments and DLJMB Partners (among others) put up about $214 million in start-up capital in exchange for shares in the company. Enron is the majority owner of TNPC, with 57-percent control. This money has allowed TNPC to make=20 important acquisitions. For instance, TNPC bought the residential and small commercia= l retail energy business of Columbia Energy Group, which includes approximate= ly 285,000 natural-gas customers and 20,000 electricity customers in eight states. This is a valuable card in TNPC's deck as it locks in customers during this time when deregulation is developing slowly in retail markets. I wouldn't be surprised if TNPC makes a similar acquisition of another customer base in the near future, such as in Texas, where customers have been spun off to energy service companies rather than being held by the T&D operations of utilities. In other words, in Texas TNPC could easily buy customers without having to buy wires or infrastructure, assuming there is a willing seller. Second, and perhaps more importantly, earlier this year Enron transferred its residential and small commercial retail operations in California and Ohio to TNPC. This deal included the operations of Enron Energy Services but did not include PG&E Energy Services, which Enron acquired earlier this year. Together with the Columbia Energy Group acquisition, TNPC has come out of the gate running with a significant beginning customer base of over 325,000 customers. Why would Enron have turned over its residential customers to TNPC? Don't forget that Enron struggled in and retreated from the California residential market, stating that it couldn't make any money in the retail market. TNPC's S1/A filing confirms rumors that Enron Energy Services actually retreated from California due to a lawsuit claimin= g the company had violated laws relating to advertising directed to residenti= al consumers in 1997 and 1998. Enron was in fact banned from selling power to the residential market in California. Under this customer transfer, Enron is able to put its money into a completely separate business=01*essen= tially moving this high-risk business venture, and worst performing part of its retail service, off its own books. Yet if TNPC succeeds, Enron still benefi= ts as it is the majority owner. I think these two factors answer why Wall Street has looked so favorably on a self-described ""new company with a limited operating history."" Looking ahead, can TNPC maintain this comparatively high value of its stock? Well, there's both good news and bad news for TNPC. First, let's look on the bright side. TNPC has put into place a great management team, starting with H. Eugene Lockhart, formerly of AT&T, as president and CEO. Other key players bring retail market expertise from work at MasterCard, Exxon and PespiCo. In addition, within the energy industry, TNPC arguably could not have a better backer than Enron. What other company's touch has been golden in nearly every venture it has pursued? In addition to being the majority owner, Enron probably is also providing TNPC access to commodities at preferential prices, which will certainly enhance its sales approach in the retail market. Plus, TNPC has access to the 24 million customers that AOL represents, which I've always thought was the company's secret weapon. But then there are the risks, and they are substantial. First, competition is not materializing rapidly on the retail side. In a state like Pennsylvan= ia, which perhaps represents the strongest deregulated market in the United States, only about 16 percent of customers in PECO's territory have opted to switch their provider. So, TNPC has an uphill climb, to say the least, in making any inroads at capturing a lock=01*and making money=01*in the ret= ail market. Second, the only way that I can see TNPC making it at all is if they continue to buy customers like they did from Columbia Energy Group. There are big questions surrounding whether the company will be able to do this or not, and much of its success hinges on this uncertainty. Third, and perhaps most serious of all, is TNPC's vulnerability on the technology side of its operation. TNPC has entered into a 10-year revenue management and customer care agreement with IBM Global Services, under which IBM will manage the company's online commerce and billing application= s. IBM's track record in developing customer care systems is less than stellar= . In fact, PG&E initiated a lawsuit against IBM a few years ago when the utility had to pull the plug on a massive $100 million customer information system (CIS), employed by IBM, which it claimed was ineffective. IBM has partnered with SCT to provide the infrastructure to be used by TNPC. Under an agreement between IBM Global Services and SCT, the SCT Banner CIS will be integrated into a number of back-office IT solutions under development by IBM for TNPC. Experts in the CIS industry have questioned whether SCT's Banner CIS can handle over one million customers. If it cannot, this will surely limit TNPC's growth potential. Moreover, although TNPC's IPO signals a strong future, there are many=20 uncertainties surrounding this nascent operation. As one of the few major players in the energy retail market, TNPC has very few competitors, with the possible exceptions of NewEnergy or GreenMountain. Another competitor is also emergi= ng in Britain's Centrica, which plans to expand in North America after its recent acquisition of Canadian retail gas supplier Direct Energy.=20 Consequently, the coming year could either make or break TNPC and the challenges that the company faces in wanting to conquer the retail market are extremely steep.

If the state tried eminent domain, it seems like it could face a long-time in the courts to finish that process. Sue Mara Enron Corp. Tel: (415) 782-7802 Fax:(415) 782-7854

I requested that Morris provide some persepective on GSS. Please review and forward to Stan, if appropriate. -----Original Message----- From: Brassfield, Morris Sent: Wednesday, November 21, 2001 10:05 AM To: Saunders, James Subject: Confidential - GSS Organization Value to ETS Here are my thoughts on the value the GSS (Global Strategic Sourcing) brings to ETS: I believe totally in the concept of strategically sourcing our materials and services for ETS, which is the concept that GSS was founded under, while still within the ETS organization. Basically the value that GSS has brought to the bottom line during the last year has been minimal to ETS. The reasons for that statement, in my opinion, are: The materials and services that ETS purchase are basic and routine. Most of those materials and service providers were identified and sourced during 1999 and 2000. ETS is reaching the point where we need fewer providers, not more. New items identified are normally rolled into one of our already sourced NPA's. Almost all large dollar items are bid out (three bids and a buy). GSS's involvement and commitment to the deal ends with the contract signing. ETS P&SM organization and our Contracts services group deals with the actual execution and the ringing of the cash register. If the GSS organization went away tomorrow, we would need the following expertise brought over from their group: (currently this group is close to 75 people.)(and very highly paid individuals) Two (2) negotiators - Contract Managers Two (2) analysts Two (2) contract administrators The administration of the following services would need to be shifted to the ISC: iBuyit System Catalog system (part of iBuyit) iPayit system We would need to re-assess the value of the contract with SourceNet and whether we continue down that path or implement our own A/P department. This would take very few staff adds to make that happen. Let me know if you need any further detail. Morris (713) 503-1409

Subject:: Pipeline safety legislation - update
Body:: print ----- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/NA/Enron on 10/16/2000 10:17 AM ----- Jeffrey Keeler 10/13/2000 12:28 PM To: Stanley Horton/Corp/Enron@Enron, Phil Lowry/OTS/Enron@ENRON, John Shafer/OTS/Enron@Enron, Shelley Corman/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, David L Johnson/OTS/Enron@ENRON, Louis Soldano/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Colleen Raker/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Michael Terraso/OTS/Enron@ENRON, Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron, Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, Joe Hillings/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Cynthia Sandherr/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Chris Long/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Clayton Seigle/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Pipeline safety legislation - update Since the defeat of the Senate pipeline safety legislation earlier this week in the House, we have been working on strategies related to action that could occur before the end of the congressional session. The following developments indicate that the legislation is still very much in play, but our primary concerns are making sure efforts going forward remain under control and preventing the passage of legislation that goes too far. Developments: House Republican leadership is not interested in pursuing the legislation any further, either through regular procedures or as an attachment to appropriations, ""omnibus"" or other must-pass measures. They are somewhat angry at the industry for not being able to fight off advances made by Reps. Dingell and Oberstar, who were able to persuade enough Democrats to vote against the Senate bill so that it fell short of the 2/3 needed for passage under suspension of the rules. Senate bill sponsors/supporters are extremely angry at House Democrats for killing the Senate legislation, and at the White House/DOT for not strongly promoting the Senate bill (which they previously had supported) and reigning in House Democrats. Senator Patty Murray called the White House and expressed her concern, which prompted a series of meetings between staff for Senate and House Democrats and the White House to discuss a solution. In these meetings, House Democrats have proposed adding several provisions from the Dingell/Oberstar legislation to the Senate bill and moving that package on an omnibus or appropriations bill. Sources close to Rep. Dingell indicate that they really do not want any bill at all, and are merely keeping up the pressure in an effort to see if they can get the Senate or industry to accept tougher provisions. Senate Democrats (including Murray, Bingaman, and Breaux) are not accepting any possible amendments to the original Senate bill, and are opposed to changing the Senate bill at all. However, Senator Murray and Republican Senator Slade Gorton (who has a tough election) both want to continue to pursue the Senate bill (unamended) as a rider to an omnibus/appropriations bill. The White House is looking to cover itself from a poor performance in the House, and is considering drafting an executive order that could be issued if no legislation passes at all. It is unclear what could or would be contained in such an order, but the White House is indicating to Senate staff that it would be more like the Senate bill than the House bill. We are working with sources close to the White House to confirm their strategy. Strategy going forward: Upon hearing that some industry associations were on Capitol Hill discussing ""what industry could live with"" in terms of provisions added to the Senate bill, I insisted (along with El Paso and others) that we not take such an approach, but rather remain consistent in our approach -- we support the Senate bill and only the Senate bill. It was approved unanimously in the Senate and by 60% of the House, and if anything moves forward on an omnibus/appropriations bill, it should be the Senate bill. Consistent with what our Senate friends are doing, we should not even recognize the Dingell/Oberstar legislation as a serious proposal, nor start accepting pieces of it as a compromise. We will be shoring up support for our position of ""if anything moves forward, it should be the Senate bill only"" with Senate supporters and leadership in the House and Senate. We will also be working to thank the 51 Democrats who supported us in the House, and make sure they have any cover they need in case their vote becomes an issue. In support of Senator Gorton's election troubles, we will be working to try to get media placement of op-eds that support the efforts he has waged and make sure the House Democrats shoulder the blame for the bill's defeat. In particular, we are hopeful that Senator McCain (who has been passionate about this issue) will write op-eds that can be placed to support Gorton and others in tough races who supported the Senate bill. Congress' state of confusion over omnibus/appropriations bills and last minute politics causes the legislative activity to be extremely fluid and subject to change rapidly, so we will have no real certainty until the session is over (which now could be as late as October 20). I will keep you posted as changes and developments occur. Jeff

Ordinarily, I would be happy to participate. However, my wife is scheduled to have hip surgery (#2) on October 1. Judging from the last time she went through this I will have to stay around until she is out of the hospital and settled back at home. Accordingly, I am not planning any travel before October 10. Too bad. On another matter, can you ask someone in your energy services company to get in touch with me? I would like to set something up with MIT's executive VP in charge of the business side of running MIT, including energy purchases and management. We have a 22 MW cogenerator, buy gas and electricity at wholesale and use lots of heating and cooling on an ever growing campus with 8,000 students, as many employees, many computer facilities and laboratories. I'm sure that we can do it more efficiently and I have been encouraging the management to look for opportunities to out-source some or all of these activities. I would like to put them in touch with someone at Enron. Thanks Paul Professor Paul L.

Daniel Waltz, of the law firm Patton Boggs LLP, is a leading expert on the EEA and will deliver what promises to be an interesting and informative segment. Congress passed the EEA in 1996, and it will increasingly shape how corporate America collects, uses, and protects valued information. In addition to explaining some of the intricacies of the EEA, Dan Waltz will include ""hypothetical"" corporate case studies (some actually torn from the headlines) to illustrate his points. This event is sponsored by ENA's Competitive Analysis and Business Controls (CABC) group and is supported by ENA legal. This event kicks-off CABC's Competitive Intelligence Standards Program, which seeks to raise awareness of issues relevant both to Enron's practitioners and senior consumers of competitive intelligence. This particular speaking engagement is designed to raise awareness of the EEA's legal guidelines, as well as to stimulate thought both on the collection opportunities against our competitors as well as how we might better protect Enron's own proprietary information. I believe the topic of the EEA is especially relevant, given that we find ourselves amidst the big bang of this new information age. All CABC staff is being asked to attend this presentation, and we are inviting a small number of other Enron employees who are engaged in aspects of serious competitive intelligence. Select executives like yourselves are being invited to attend, and I would welcome any suggestions of others that you think might benefit from attending this event. The EEA presentation is set for August 15, 1:30-3:00 PM, in the 50th floor Conference room. Please RSVP to either myself or Sharon Purswell. Hope to see you there. P.S. By the way, our next speaker segment in the CI Standards Program will concentrate on the guidelines and implications of the ""Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA),"" and will likely be scheduled for the fall.

Subject:: WPTF Friday Deliver Unto Us A Burrito
Body:: THE FRIDAY BURRITO ""...more fun than a fortune cookie, and at least as accurate."" =01&Are those folks smoking crack?=018 he asked in an outrage. My friend, = Ol=01, Dave in Houston, has trouble understanding the workings of our power business here in California. In fact, so do I. Yesterday=01,s Joint Senate/Assembly Committee on Energy and Natural Resources did nothing to improve either Dave=01,s or my understanding of the national embarrassment California is perpetrating with electricity deregulation. =01&The next thing you know, they will be taking property, and forcing utilities to build power plants and transmission,=018 he mused between sips of Dixie longneck beer and chomps of jalapeno peppers. =01&Come to think of it, Dave, they did say something about that. Yeah,=018 I recalled, =01&Senator Peace was expounding on his favorite idea which is forcing the ISO or the utilities to build peakers, and not let the market build them. I can=01,t remember if that was before or after he suggested to EOB Chairman Kahn that the ISO and the PX should be folded into State agencies under the direction of the Electric Oversight Board.=018 I know what you are thinking right now. The next thing you know California will have regulated retail rates. That recipe should be out of the PUC=01,s oven sometime next week. =01&Well, the power marketers are jigging the system, bidding up to the ISO=01,s bid cap. There is no way you can tell me that a generator planned to make $750/MWH in its pro forma,=018 Dave added. =01&So you agree with Herr (Hair) Peace! You don=01,t believe in markets,=018 I retorted. = =01&Oh, I believe in them, but I remember when I was short on a 300 MW trade, and without any notice or advanced warning, the price in the Midwest market went against me,=018 Dave recalled. =01&I called everyone who I tra= ded with, and they had nothing. I finally called XXXXX, and I asked what will it cost for 50 MW?=018 =01&Why didn=01,t you ask for 300?=018 I wondered. =01&I didn=01,t want to= show him my position. You get hosed when you show the buyer your position. Ask for 50, first,=018 Dave chided. =01&What happened?=018 =01&Oh, they offered to sell for $150/MWH. I said I= =01,d take it, and then said I needed another fifty. He asked $300. I took that, and he priced the next 50 MW at $600,=018 lamented Dave. =01&He just wanted to see how far he could push me. That=01,s what I mean when I say the traders are jigging it.=018 =01&But Dave, you old communist, your forgetting the trading function is what mitigates the risk. The traders are the in between people who guess at the price. Sometimes they guess right, and sometimes they guess wrong. But the damage, or the reward, is on their book, not passed on to the ultimate consumer. It has nothing to do with the marginal cost of a generating plant.=018 And there you have it. Put in a price cap, and the traders have a target for which to shoot. I can=01,t prove the following, yet, but I=01,l= l wager with any of you that as the price cap level dips down, the average trading price climbs even as the so-called =01&dysfunctional=018 price spik= es are eliminated. Consumers get hosed, and the fundamental economic principle is upheld, which is, one can never be made better off with the imposition of an additional constraint. I feel better already. Here is what is on our short agenda this week. >>> Things in the Mailbag >>> Things in the People=01,s Republic of California @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings @@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market >>> Odds & Ends (_!_) >>> Things in the Mailbag It has been awhile since we put the mail feedbag on and had a munch. Here is what my friends have been writing me. FPL Energy=01,s Steve Ponder was only too quick to tell me, =01&Please Gary= , no more whining about your computer. How old are you?? Is this the year you get the AARP letter??? A very depressing moment. Do you really not know how to spell Morro Bay??? Please let us know what is going on with your son's hockey team?? Don't forget the cigars for Moron??? Bay!!!!=018 It is good to have friends like Steve. They make the pain of separation so much easier. And Steve, when you FPL guys get that Entergy merger sorted out, in a dozen years or so, you let us know. I want to participate in the name selection for the new entity. How about Fentergy PLus? Next, from the PX=01,s Mark Hoppe, who writes, =01&As you've heard from others, I don't know quite how you manage to knock out all this material each week. The burrito is informative, humorous and usually contains a sprinkle of irony, tragedy (ISO Drama). Though you are usually neutral regarding the PX, you are not unduly negative which I appreciate. I think we do a pretty good job over here and so often people in the industry forget the amount effort and challenge it took the PX to successfully open this market.=018 Thanks, Mark. I just want you to know that my ability to write this stuff every week is not constrained by the facts or evidence. I have learned from watching Herr (Hair?) Peace, that as long as you can talk (write, too) fast, and have conviction in your statements, regardless of how groundless they may be, you will have a willing and eager audience. A few weeks ago, I received from the PX=01,s Jennifer Sherwood a note, which she wants you to know are her opinions, not necessarily the PX=01,s. It=01,s okay, Jennifer. I paid George,yesterday, the $20 I owed him for that sham Rose Bowl bet, (remember?, Stanford lost) and your opinions are cool with us. =01&Just curious - has anyone been comparing high unleaded prices to high CA electricity prices? What I mean is, we are up in arms about how we should protect the unfortunate San Diego consumer who can't afford to keep the AC on. But what about the inflated unleaded gas prices the whole country has seen over the last few months? No effort is made by the government to shield the consumer from how much it costs to fill their gas tank. No mention is made of those who can't afford to drive to the grocery store because they can't afford the extra 15 or 20 cents a gallon. The costs are passed along to the consumer without pause. Granted there are differences between the unleaded market and the electricity market in terms of demand-side responsiveness, but then again is it that much different to say, =01+I can't drive today because gas is too expensive=01, vs. =01+I can't turn up the AC today because it's too expensive.=01,=018 Finally, from one of our [secret] Washington readers, and I am not telling who, I received the following: =01&I ... broke down and listened to the [ISO Governing Board] discussion and vote. Ugh! I too noted that the ""speak fast"" was applied to everyone but Herr Peace. My goodness, what a mess we have. I loved Jerry's picture in USA Today -- it spoke volumes. My sources at FERC tell me, though, that we should keep an eye out for {FERC Chairman] Hoecker to do something really ... [Censored] ... for political reasons. Given no Commission meetings til September, the only way to act is by unanimous consent, so I would hope he can't do all that much.=018 >>> Things in the People=01,s Republic of California @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report Several of you people commented to me that the ISO=01,s reply to the PUC/EOB report was very good. I decided to excerpt the best sections of it for the Burrito. The full document can be found on the ISO=01,s website. =01&... the [PUC/EOB] Report asserts that the suspected activities of certain generators on June 13 created frequency instability leading to the Bay Area blackouts the following day. In fact, the events of June 13 and June 14 were completely independent of one another. The voltage instability on June 14 was caused by system conditions on that day alone -- exceptionally high loads, insufficient generation in the specific local area, and transmission constraints that prevented the import of generation from outside the area. =01&The Report states that the ISO =01&never tried=018 to call upon consume= rs to reduce demand in order to avoid the Bay Area blackouts. In fact, the ISO had in place on June 14 a number of demand response programs designed to reduce load including the Summer 2000 Demand Response Program, under which customers have agreed, through a prior solicitation, to curtail energy use in exchange for a fee =01&The Report makes a number of assertions concerning the prices paid by =01+purchasers=01, of energy as a result of the recent price spikes (e.g. $= 1.2 billion in the month of June alone). These assertions leave one with the mistaken impression that these prices reflect amounts actually paid by the UDCs and/or passed through to customers. However, in determining the total cost of energy, one must determine the impact of any forward contracts entered into by the UDCs in advance of the wholesale energy markets. These contracts, which are designed to =01&lock-in=018 a specific price in advance of real-time or near real-time market activities, are specifically designed to mitigate the impact of price volatility, and are standard in all commodities markets. We have reason to believe that some of the UDCs were substantially hedged during the period of the recent price spikes. =01&In a similar vein, the reports asserts that California =01&might well= =018 have saved $110 million dollars had a $250 price cap been in place in May and June. This assertion assumes that all energy purchases would have been made at or below the $250 bid cap. In fact, during times of peak demand, when all of the state=01,s generation has been exhausted, the ISO competes with neighboring regions for available generation. In order to secure the necessary power, the ISO must purchase, on a bilateral basis, this energy from resources located outside of the ISO=01,s control area. =01&The Report asserts that California power markets =01&are not now competitive=018 and implies, erroneously in our view, that this is the normal state of affairs. It is not. The Market Surveillance Committee has noted that =01&market power in the California energy market appears to arise primarily during periods of peak demand,=018 and warned that demand growth would increase the incidence of market power during the summer of 2000. =01&The Report asserts that the ISO is answerable only to a self-interested board and not to the citizens of California. This simply is not the case. The ISO is subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act and to the rules and regulations of FERC, which dictate, in part, that wholesale energy rates must be just and reasonable and in the public interest. The ISO further operates under a detailed tariff reviewed and approved by FERC. Every change to our market design and virtually every aspect of the ISO=01,s business is subject to review and scrutiny by FERC. The FERC process provides substantial opportunities for input by the state agencies and such agencies have, in fact, been active participants in the FERC proceedings. =01&The Report asserts that California supply conditions have been affected by restructuring and that somehow the restructuring choices have made California more vulnerable to supply shortages. This assertion is unfounded. Significant load growth in California and neighboring states coupled with a lack of significant infrastructure investment in both generation and transmission have caused this vulnerability. Restructuring has increased proposed power plant applications many fold. Only by immediate and sustained attention to streamlining approval and siting processes for both of these critical infrastructure elements will this significant shortage be addressed.=018 >>> Things in the People=01,s Republic of California @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings If you want to imagine a scary sight, imagine, then, twelve California legislators gathering together in one hearing room to rectify the wrongs of electric restructuring. Also imagine, as if you are in the Twilight Zone, witnesses that are slow on their feet, and reckless in their facts. Then you get a glimpse of what yesterday=01,s Joint Senate/Assembly hearing was like. It started over two hours late. The Senate was busy congratulating one of their own who is term-limited out next session, and they wanted to heap on the glory. That said, the show began with CEC Commissioner Bill Keese. Mr. Keese has one story, and regardless how well he tells it, and he does, it is always the same story. It is the heat storm story. One can imagine in the heat storm story a lead character who is a single-mom, call her Lady-Bird Bowen, who travels across an angry land with her precocious pre-teen child, Stevie Wonderboy. They are searching for electric power plants in the dessert, which, by the grace of God have been shipped to other countries which have more liberal returns on investment. Being the first speaker, Mr. Keese took at least half the heat (storm) of the day. The rage of the Energy Fuhrer was palpable. Last week, San Diegans shed 350 MW of load last week to save the entire system, and did not receive one penny of compensation (I=01,m not making that up ... He said it). He is sick of hearing about demand management as being a solution for the problem over the last five years, and he is about done listening. People in San Diego are depressed by the sudden price hikes. Yikes! Keese did mention that the California reserve margin has sunk to 7%, but in neighboring Arizona, the reserve margin is -1% or -2%!! Mr. Keese correctly pointed out that electric power is not solely a California problem, it is a regional problem. One member of the Committee asked what the legislature could do to speed up the power plant siting and construction process? Keese referred to Governor Gray Davis=01, Executive Order issued last week to which the CEC plans to respond soon, date uncertain, that lays out a 6 month permitting time line. The six months are enough if the applicant has the land secured, zoning okayed, transmission access, and air offsets. Hmmmmmm. That alone might take six months before you get to the CEC. The next panel included Mr. Kahn of the EOB, and Ms. Lynch. I went too hard on her last week, calling her Let=01,s Do Lynch. That was a 0.8 TPC. Sorry. I promise to be nicer starting now. The Energy Fuhrer instructed Ms. Lynch to use her authority to order SDG&E to divert the pass through of funds from the customers to the PX until the dysfunction of the market is cured. Put it in an escrow account. Ms Lynch promised to review this option at her August 21 PUC Meeting where she will enact SDG&E rate caps (told you). The star of the day, I thought, was FERC General Counsel Doug Smith. Mr. Smith comes to Sacramento. Isn=01,t that a switch? Mr. Smith came in place of Mr. Hoecker, thank the Lord. Mr. Smith put into FERC-eese what these 12 legislators could not get through their heads any other way. The 12 angry legislators were looking for a way for FERC to declare the wholesale market as non-competitive, and then ask the generators to give back the money they over collected. When can we do that? Mr. Smith answered as only a FERC attorney can answer. There is a process. It takes time. You must have evidence. FERC uses a three-part criteria for assessing whether or not market based rates are allowable. It=01,s based on market concentration and dominance, not the existence of high prices. You would have to sue FERC in federal court, and the best you could hope for is for FERC to reconsider its decision upon remand from the US Court of Appeals. Slowly, the wind came out of the sails of the gang of 12. They were stumped. Herr (Hair?) Peace screamed, couldn=01,t you, Mr. Smith of FERC, today use your authority to declare the markets non-competitive, that generators who had market based rates have exercised market power, and retro-actively implement a $250 rate cap across the Western region? Like a wheezing accordion, Mr. Smith played back and forth the familiar strains of music, like a solo street musician on the corner. Back and forth: the process, the process, the process. There have been times in the past I hated the process at FERC. Today, I have a renewed respect for what process affords me and you ... Freedom from the tyranny of a mob.

EMSHWILLER Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL LOS ANGELES -- California may be struggling to keep its lights on, but one thing there is no shortage of is accusations over who is to blame for an electricity crisis that has sent power prices skyrocketing. In recent days, top California officials have stepped up their rhetoric against a handful of merchant power companies, many of them Texas-based, that supply the state with much of its juice. Gov. Gray Davis says companies such as Reliant Energy Inc., of Houston, have engaged in ""unconscionable price-gouging."" Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission and a Davis appointee, proclaims that a ""cartel"" of electricity producers has created artificial shortages. Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante is backing a bill that would make energy price-fixing a felony, and as a private citizen he is suing several major power producers in Los Angeles state court. Investigations Under Way About half a dozen investigations are being conducted by entities ranging from state legislative committees to the California attorney general's office. So far, these probes -- some of which have been under way for months -- haven't yet yielded either civil or criminal charges. While the energy suppliers are generating ""unconscionable profits,"" the question remains ""whether they are illegal profits,"" says California Attorney General Bill Lockyer, who has offered rewards of as much as hundreds of millions of dollars for information about lawbreaking in the energy business. Mr. Lockyer says he believes his office will eventually file civil charges against suppliers. He would very much like to add criminal counts. ""I would love to personally escort [Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth] Lay to an 8 x 10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says 'Hi my name is Spike, honey,' "" adds Mr. Lockyer. Houston-based Enron is a major energy-trading company. Like other such firms, Enron has denied wrongdoing in the California market. Mark Palmer, Enron's vice president for corporate communications, said Mr. Lockyer's comment about Mr. Lay "" is so counterproductive that it doesn't merit a response."" Investigators and academics say there is abundant evidence that individual firms have been exercising ""market power."" This term is used to denote efforts to influence wholesale-electricity prices, such as by withholding supplies. The California Independent System Operator, or ISO, which manages the state's electric transmission grid, estimates that by exercising market power, suppliers may have added about $6.8 billion to the cost of electricity in the state since early last year. A single firm exercising such power isn't necessarily illegal, says Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy Institute. If a company is a large supplier in the state and ""you're not exercising market power, you are not doing your job"" on behalf of shareholders, he says. Mr. Borenstein and others say that there are steps that should be taken against suppliers. They note that under federal power law, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission can order refunds for wholesale prices that are above ""just and reasonable"" levels. So far, FERC has tentatively ordered California suppliers to make tens of millions of dollars of such refunds, as part of that agency's ongoing inquiry into the California market. Critics of the suppliers and FERC say the refunds should be in the billions of dollars. The power industry, not surprisingly, says there is nothing to accusations of price manipulation or collusion. Executives point to a botched state-utility-deregulation plan that relies heavily on volatile spot-market purchases. Suppliers note that over the past decade, California didn't build enough new power plants to keep up with demand growth. The allegations of manipulation are ""a lot of sound and fury and they won't produce anything,"" says Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an industry trade group. Investigations Aplenty In the year since California's energy deregulation plan began resulting in higher prices and even blackouts, a flurry of investigations has gotten under way. Here are the main ones: Agency ????Investigation Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ????Whether generators are charging more than ""just and reasonable"" rates as demanded by the Federal Power Act; whether El Paso Corp. used its position as a major natural-gas supplier to the state to illegally drive up the price of fuel used to generate electricity. California Public Utilities Commission and the State Attorney General ????Whether generators and power traders have acted illegally through collusion or other means to artificially inflate electricity prices. PUC and California Independent System Operator ????Whether generation plants were shut down for spurious reasons in order to create supply shortages and, thus, to raise electricity prices. California Electricity Oversight Board ????Whether patterns of bidding and pricing in California's electricity auction indicate collusive or otherwise illegal behavior. Sources: state and federal agencies Power generators also point to sharp increases in some of their costs, particularly natural gas, which is a major power-plant fuel. This rise in natural-gas prices also has set off a flurry of investigations over possible manipulation. One such case, involving El Paso Corp., Houston, is the subject of probes by federal and state officials. El Paso denies any wrongdoing. While power-industry officials say they have been cooperating with the investigations, law-enforcement officials say they have hit some roadblocks. For instance, Mr. Lockyer's office has gone to San Francisco state court to enforce subpoenas against Reliant, Houston-based Dynegy Inc. and Southern Co. and Mirant Corp., both of Atlanta, after the companies resisted turning over certain business documents they deemed confidential. Investigators have zeroed in on the increased frequency with which plants are going out of service for unscheduled outages. At times, several thousand fewer megawatts of capacity are available than a year ago. A thousand megawatts can power about one million homes. 'Forced Outage' Rate Rises Generators say that this increased ""forced outage"" rate shows that tight supplies over the past year have required them to run plants, some of them more than 40 years old, for long periods without routine maintenance. This combination has produced more breakdowns. ""Plants have been running flat out,"" says Tom Williams, a spokesman for Duke Energy Co., Charlotte, N.C., which says that its California power plants produced 50% more electricity in 2000 than in 1999. At the same time, during periods of lower demand, the number of unplanned outages often seems to rise enough to keep supplies tight, says Frank Wolak, a Stanford University professor and chairman of the ISO's market surveillance committee. ""Clearly, something is going on here."" However, he and others say that it is almost impossible to tell why a particular pipe failed or whether such a failure was a legitimate reason to reduce output. Some of the most intriguing evidence to date about forced outages surfaced in a federal case. FERC officials said an investigation had raised questions about whether two major power companies had taken plants out of service in order to reap higher electricity prices. The charges against AES Corp., Arlington, Va., which owns the plants, and Williams Cos., Tulsa, Okla., which markets their output, asserted that those actions allowed the companies to reap an extra $10.8 million in revenue. In one instance, according to case filings, a Williams employee ""indicated"" to AES officials that his firm wouldn't financially penalize AES for extending an outage at one plant. This conversation, which was voluntarily divulged by Williams, could be an indication of collusion. Williams and AES settled the case without admitting any wrongdoing by paying back $8 million to the ISO and by taking certain other measures. A Williams spokeswoman says the employee who talked to AES was ""counseled not to enter into any conversations of that nature"" in the future. Another issue raised by the FERC case touched on maintenance procedures. According to the filings, AES stopped doing a certain procedure to keep its plant's cooling system from getting clogged. The clogging of the system was cited as a reason for one of the forced outages. Mark Woodruff, president of the AES unit that operates the plant in question, says the company substituted what it felt was an equally effective maintenance procedure. If someone was looking to keep supplies tight and prices high, changes in maintenance procedures would be an easy way to ensure that plants, particularly old ones, have frequent forced outages, says a senior utility-industry executive. By restricting maintenance resources, he says, an operator can simply allow a plant ""to take itself out of service."" Write to John R. Emshwiller at john.emshwiller@wsj.com Copyright 2001 Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service ???????????????????????Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service Costa Times 22, 2001, Tuesday SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS KR-ACC-NO: ?K4988 LENGTH: 803 words HEADLINE: ISO will give advanced warning of power blackouts BYLINE: By Mike Taugher and Andrew LaMar BODY: ??WALNUT CREEK, Calif. _ The East has its hurricane watches and hurricane warnings. Now California has power watches and power warnings to guide residents through days of summer blackouts. ??Beginning next week, forecasters who look at variables like electricity loads and transmission constraints instead of wind speeds and barometric pressure will lay the odds of blackouts being imposed the next day. If those odds appear to be 50-50 or greater, they will issue a power warning. ??In addition, the California Independent System Operator will issue 30-minute advisories to warn state residents that blackouts are probably imminent. ??The new warnings are in response to complaints that blackouts have taken people by surprise. ??""What we're hearing from the public is they wanted a little more heads-up when it comes to blackouts,"" said ISO spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle. ??Meanwhile, Gov. Gray Davis was in Chicago Monday to hear firsthand from city officials about how an advance notification program can work. State lawmakers are exploring ways to provide Californians with greater notice of potential blackouts, including scheduling them in advance. ??In Chicago, where aging lines and structural limitations have produced a string of power outages over the past two summers, residents often receive 30 minutes warning a blackout is coming, and grid operators work with city agencies and police to ensure criminals don't take advantage of the opportunity. ??California's new warning system has considerable limits. ??The ISO, after all, does not determine where blackouts occur. They simply tell the three utilities in the system _ Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric _ when to shut off power and how much to turn off. ??It is up to the utilities to determine where the blackouts occur. ??PG&E's website posts which of 14 outage blocks is next to be hit, so anyone who knows their block number could use information from PG&E and the ISO websites to prepare for a blackout. ??PG&E spokesman John Nelson said the Northern California utility can make tens of thousands of phone calls to businesses and customers who need power for life-support systems and other medical necessities ""in a very short period of time."" ??""We think that anything that increases the amount of time that we're given by the ISO . . . is a good thing,"" Nelson said, adding that at the beginning of this year the utility was assuming that it would get about 30 minutes notice before blackouts were ordered. ??In another development on Monday, state Controller Kathleen Connell issued another warning about the financial toll California's energy crisis is taking on the state treasury. Connell said the state could run out of cash by Sept. 1 if $ 13.4 billion in revenue bonds aren't sold. ??The state plans to sell the bonds in late August to cover the cost of buying electricity needed by financially troubled Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison to serve their customers. ??Even if the bonds go through without a hitch, Connell said the state will have to seek more bonds or borrow between $3 billion and $5 billion beginning February 2002 to continue buying power. She said electricity purchases are costing the state more than the governor anticipated and far less has been bought through long-term contracts than Davis planned. ??But the governor's top energy aides challenged Connell's analysis and said they believe long-term contracts now being put in place combined with conservation efforts will bring spending down. Joe Fichera, a Davis financial adviser, said the state spent $1.8 billion to buy power in April, only 1.4 percent higher than the $1.78 billion estimated. ??""I think reasonable people can differ in terms of the projections,"" Fichera said. ""I don't know what's underlying all of her assumptions and such. We do have more complete information . . . ."" ??To highlight the exorbitant costs of power, Connell pointed to an enlarged picture of a $533 million check the state sent the Mirant Corp. for April power purchases. ??Mirant defended its sales. Included in its April sales were $126 million worth of electricity that the company bought from companies unwilling to sell to California but which Mirant purchased and then sold to California at a 12 percent markup, according to figures released by the company. ??""If the intent was to somehow attack Mirant for its role in the California market in April, then I'd have to say that the state has apparently decided to bite a helping hand,"" said Randy Harrison, CEO of Mirant's western U.S. operations. ??KRT CALIFORNIA is a premium service of Knight Ridder/Tribune ??(c) 2001, Contra Costa Times (Walnut Creek, Calif.). ??Visit the Contra Costa Times on the Web at http://www.cctimes.com/ JOURNAL-CODE: CC LOAD-DATE: May 22, 2001 of 85 DOCUMENTS 2001 Copley News Service News Service 22, 2001, Tuesday SECTION: State and regional LENGTH: 1066 words HEADLINE: State sends $533.2 million to company, part of April bill BYLINE: Ed Mendel DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??One of the biggest single checks ever issued by the state of California, $533.2 million, went to an Atlanta-based firm Friday for power purchased for California utility customers during a single month, April. ??Mirant, formerly Southern Energy, says more than half of the power came from three plants in the San Francisco Bay Area that it purchased from Pacific Gas and Electric for $801 million under a failed deregulation plan. ??State Treasurer Kathleen Connell, who displayed a blown-up copy of the check at a news conference yesterday, said she thinks the state has failed to obtain enough cheap long-term power contracts and will have to borrow more than the $13.4 billion planned. ??Connell, an elected official who issues state checks, said the power bills she had paid by last Thursday, totaling $5.1 billion, provide no basis for assuming that the price of electricity ''is dropping and that it will continue to drop through the summer.'' ??But a consultant for Gov. Gray Davis said the state, which has more long-term contracts than Connell has seen, is on track to control power costs with the aid of conservation and that it plans to meet its goals without additional borrowing. ??''I think the public should have confidence that this is not a rosy scenario,'' said Joseph Fichera of Saber Partners, a Davis consultant. ''It's the expected scenario.'' ??The state plans to issue a bond of up to $13.4 billion in late August that will repay the general-fund taxpayer money used for power purchases, about $7 billion so far. The bond will be paid off over 15 years by utility customers. ??Davis has declined to reveal details of state spending for power, arguing that the information would be used by power suppliers to submit higher bids. A group of newspapers and Republican legislators have filed lawsuits to force disclosure. ??Connell said she has received 25 contracts from 17 power suppliers. She declined to release details of the contracts, saying they are complicated and have varying prices. ??Connell said the check for $533,181,235 issued to Mirant Friday is one of the largest she has written since taking office in 1995. ??''This purchase was made entirely at spot-market prices,'' Connell said, ''even though the Department of Water Resources (the state agency that purchases power) has an executed long-term contract with this company.'' ??Mirant said in a statement that, at the request of the state, its marketing arm gave the state a ''helping hand'' by buying power from suppliers not willing to sell to the state and then reselling the power to the state. ??''We've done the state a tremendous service in purchasing power on its behalf,'' said Randy Harrison, Mirant's Western chief executive officer, ''and it's wrong for the transactions to be misinterpreted and skewed in a negative light.'' ??Mirant said its subsidiaries generated 1.377 million megawatt-hours in April, while its marketing arm purchased enough additional electricity to boost the total sold to the state during the month to 2.077 million megawatt-hours. ??The firm said the power was sold for an average of $256.87 per megawatt-hour. That's below the $346 average that the state expects to pay on the expensive spot market during the second quarter of this year, from April through June. ??But it's well above the average price of $69 per megawatt-hour said to have been obtained in the first round of long-term contracts negotiated by the state. ??Mirant purchased three power plants from PG&E capable of producing 3,000 megawatts during a controversial part of deregulation. The state Public Utilities Commission ordered utilities to sell off at least half of their fossil-fuel power plants without requiring the purchasers to provide low-cost power to California. ??The utilities sold nearly two dozen major power plants capable of producing more than 20,000 megawatts. The largest group of plants, 4,700 megawatts, went to AES Corp. of Virginia. Three Texas firms purchased plants producing 7,000 megawatts. ??The power supply situation in California remained sound enough yesterday to ward off blackouts, although temperatures are on the rise throughout the state. More heat means more air conditioning, and a greater strain on the system. ??But starting next month, the state's electricity grid managers plan to provide businesses and consumers with better forecasts of potential rolling blackouts. ??The California Independent System Operator will post on its Web site ''power warnings'' when there is at least a 50 percent chance that rolling blackouts might be required during the next 24 hours. The ISO will issue a ''power watch'' when less-critical shortages are anticipated in advance of high demand days. ??The agency also plans to give a 30-minute warning before it orders utilities to cut power to customers, posting information about probable interruptions on its Web site. Its Web site address is www.caiso.com. ??''There have been a number of requests from businesses and consumers alike that would like more advance notice and to be able to plan better. That's what we are trying to do,'' ISO spokeswoman Lorie O'Donley said. ??O'Donley said many details about how notifications will occur still have to be worked out, including whether e-mails or pagers might be used. ??In other developments in the electricity crisis: ???About 1.5 million compact fluorescent light bulbs will be distributed to 375,000 households as part of the ''Power Walk'' program that began during the weekend. Members of the California Conservation Corps are going door-to-door in parts of some cities to distribute the bulbs as part of a $20 million conservation program. ???Republican legislative leaders sent Davis a letter criticizing the governor for using taxpayer funds to hire two aides to former Vice President Al Gore as communication consultants for $30,000 a month. The Republicans said Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane operate ''a partisan, cut-throat political communications firm.'' ???The state auditor general said in a report on energy deregulation that the state is not meeting some of its goals for conservation and for building new power plants. The auditor also said the PUC does not have a process for quickly approving new transmission lines. The state has been importing about 20 percent of its power.

Rose DATELINE: SAN DIEGO BODY: ??San Dieg Gas and Electric's commercial customers are attacking the prospect of paying an average of 29 percent more to cover the state's soaring cost of buying electricity. ??At a California Public Utilities Commission hearing in San Diego yesterday, some business customers also noted the irony that only in February did they win the same rate freeze as residential customers. ??''We need rates we can depend on,'' said John Roberts, who owns an irrigation products business in San Marcos. ??SDG&E customers were the first to bear the brunt of deregulation, and the utility's residential ratepayers were the first to win a reprieve when the state passed a 6.5-cent per kilowatt hour cap. ??The SDG&E cap is expected to end for all customers in the coming weeks as the commission moves to increase SDG&E's rates to levels now paid by customers of PG&E and Edison, which are about 3 cents per kilowatt hour higher. ??Yesterday's hearing, however, was for commercial rates. ??Roberts said his San Marcos-based irrigation products company has withstood a tripling of power costs over the past year, while having to cut the cost of its products because of competition, he said. ??Roberts added that socking businesses with high costs in order to spare residential electricity customers from expected rate hikes could be counterproductive. ??''If businesses leave the state, they'll be without jobs, and a $30 savings on their power bills won't mean much,'' Roberts said. ??The hearing at the County Administration Building was attended by about 30 people. An additional hearing is scheduled at 7 p.m. today in the Community Rooms at the Oceanside Civic Center, 330 N. Coast Highway. ??Larger crowds are expected for hearings on residential rate increases.

Gray Davis' decision to spend $30,000 a month in taxpayer money to retain communications consultants known for their highly partisan work. ??Labeling consultants Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane as ""cut-throat,"" Senate GOP leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga and Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks said in a letter to Davis that the hiring ""undermines the assertions you have made both publicly and privately throughout this crisis."" ??Davis announced Friday that he retained the duo and that the state will pay them a combined $30,000 a month for at least the next six months. ??""We're not going to support the hiring of political hacks on government payroll,"" Brulte said in an interview. ""Lehane and Fabiani are very talented. The issue is which payroll is appropriate. . . . These are political opposition research attack dogs. If the governor wants them, he ought to pay for them with his $30-million political war chest."" ??Some consumer advocates also criticized the move, citing the consultants' work on behalf of Southern California Edison. In their private consulting business, Fabiani and Lehane are working to win over public and political support for Davis' $3.5-billion plan to rescue Edison from its financial difficulties. Legislation embodying aspects of the deal is pending in Sacramento. ??On Monday, Brulte and Cox also complained about the consultants' dual role. ??""California taxpayers should not be asked to finance political consultants or individuals who have a vested business interest with the state,"" the letter said. ??Fabiani and Lehane had worked in the Clinton administration, and in Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign, where they gained a reputation as attack-oriented operatives. Lehane on Monday defended the governor's decision to use tax money to pay their fees, saying government often hires outside experts and that he and Fabiani will ""serve as communications advisors to help the governor fight against these generators."" ??""The Republicans,"" Lehane added, ""ought to be spending time writing letters to George W. Bush to get him to stop the Texas generators from gouging California. . . . That is the real issue here."" ??Davis, meanwhile, returned to California on Monday after a weekend of fund-raisers. He was in Texas on Saturday for a Dallas event that had been scheduled for April 11. It was postponed when Pacific Gas & Electric filed for bankruptcy protection. ??""There is a very large fund-raising base for Democrats in Texas,"" Davis' campaign strategist, Garry South, said of the state that is home to some of the generators that Davis has criticized. ??Davis traveled to Chicago for another fund-raiser Sunday, then met Monday with city officials to discuss how Chicago deals with electrical blackouts. ??After blackouts crippled downtown Chicago in the summer of 1999, Mayor Richard M. Daley demanded that the city's electricity provider, Commonwealth Edison, give advance notice of power cuts. Customers now sometimes receive warnings two or three days in advance. ??Davis emerged from the meeting saying ""the utilities have got to tell us in advance when they're going to have a planned blackout."" ??It was not, however, readily apparent how Chicago's solutions would translate to California, because its electrical problems are vastly different. Rather than suffering a shortage of electricity throughout the grid like California, Chicago has the more microcosmic ills of an aging system--an obsolete transformer going down, for example, leaving several city blocks in the dark until workers can fix it. ??* ??Times staff writer Eric Slater contributed to this story.

BYLINE: DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Legislative Democrats today will sue federal energy regulators, charging that their inaction threatens elderly people in nursing homes, children in day care centers, law enforcement and its ability to fight crime, and the state's drinking water supplies. ??Rather than focus on record wholesale energy costs, the lawsuit takes a new tack, homing in on the threat to health and safety posed by California's energy crisis and the blackouts likely this summer. ??A draft of the suit seeks to force the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to set ""just and reasonable"" wholesale power rates as a way of ending the crisis before blackouts occur. The action is being filed by veteran trial attorney Joe Cotchett on behalf of Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco), Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks), and the city of Oakland. ??""A crisis of unprecedented dimensions is already taking shape in California,"" the draft says. ""The public health, safety and welfare of the state's 34 million residents is in jeopardy due to the tragic consequences of rolling blackouts and punitive prices."" ??Suit Says Blackouts Pose Threats ??Until now, most California officials, including Gov. Gray Davis, have been urging that the regulatory commission cap wholesale power prices as a way of limiting costs to the state, which has spent more than $6 billion buying electricity since January. ??In the lawsuit, Cotchett will be arguing that while higher bills will stretch the budgets of people on fixed incomes, frail elderly people ""are left to wonder if their oxygen tanks, drip IVs, dialysis machines and electricity-powered therapeutic beds will respond when they are needed."" ??""Rolling blackouts represent more than just an annoyance for the men, women and children with disabilities,"" the suit says. ""They represent an imminent threat to life, health and independence."" ??Cotchett said the suit will be filed in the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, bypassing the federal trial court. Cotchett said the circuit court has direct jurisdiction over FERC. ??Joining Cotchett will be Clark Kelso, a professor at McGeorge Law School in Sacramento who briefly was insurance commissioner last year after Chuck Quackenbush resigned. Kelso said he initially was skeptical that lawmakers had legal standing to sue. But after Cotchett spoke with him, Kelso said he became convinced the suit had merit. ??""Let's face it,"" said Kelso, a Republican, ""this is the single most important issue that the state faces for the next six months."" ??Watching the Water Supply ??The suit cites warnings from governmental agencies about the implications of blackouts, including one the state Department of Health Services issued earlier this month to public water agencies statewide. The warning contains a sample notice that local water authorities should give to consumers. ??""If the water looks cloudy or dirty,"" the warning says, ""you should not drink it."" The warning suggests that if people are concerned about water quality, they can boil it or add ""eight drops of household bleach to one gallon of water, and let it sit for 30 minutes."" ??Most water agencies have back-up generators. But the suit says that ""if an agency's water treatment facilities are hit by a power outage, a two-hour blackout can result in two-day interruptions in providing safe drinking water because of time needed to bring equipment back online and flush potentially contaminated water from the system.""

BYLINE: MIGUEL BUSTILLO, NANCY VOGEL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Californians will hear an expanded forecast on their morning commutes this summer, courtesy of the energy crisis: ""The 405 Freeway is jammed, there's a slim chance of showers, and oh, by the way, there's a 50% likelihood of blackouts."" ??By the end of this month, the California Independent System Operator, the agency that manages the state's power grid, expects to issue 24-hour forecasts generally detailing when and where blackouts can be expected. ??It is also piecing together a high-tech system to give businesses, government officials and the public at least a half-hour notice of a probable blackout in their area. ??Just how those notices will be issued remains somewhat up in the air, but Cal-ISO is talking with private companies capable of notifying more than 10,000 customers a minute via fax and phone, and millions a minute via wireless communications such as pagers. ??Cal-ISO assembled the plan after complaints from businesses, particularly those in the Silicon Valley, that last-minute blackouts were costing California millions. The plan also responds to growing political pressure for the public to be kept informed of the barrage of outages that is expected to darken the state this summer because of insufficient supplies of electricity. ??If Californians' electricity use pattern is similar to last year's, Cal-ISO has projected, the state could suffer 34 days of blackouts, making increased notification crucial. ??With a shortage of hydroelectric power imports from the drought-stricken Pacific Northwest, and no new power plants coming online until July, the agency calculates that there will be a supply-demand gap in June of 3,700 megawatts--enough power to supply 2.8 million homes. A national utility industry group painted a more dire scenario last week when it predicted that California will experience up to 260 hours of blackouts this summer. ??""The weather report and traffic report are good analogies; people know they are not 100% accurate, but if [a blackout] really means a lot to them, they will check in,"" said Mike Florio of the Utility Reform Network, who serves on the Cal-ISO board. ??Details remain sketchy, and the programs may be altered when the board meets Thursday. But a Web page called ""Today's Outlook"" on the agency's Internet site, http://www.caiso.com, will be created to illustrate, hour by hour, how much electricity is available during a 24-hour period and whether there is a predicted surplus or shortfall. ??Media outreach will be expanded to provide news bulletins on electricity conditions a day in advance. They will not only include demand projections and the effects of weather, but they also will define the level of emergency that is expected. ??A ""power watch"" will be sounded during stage 1 and stage 2 shortages, and a more serious ""power warning"" if there is a 50-50 chance of a stage 3, which often results in blackouts. (Stage 1 emergencies occur when power reserves drop below 7%, stage 2 5% and stage 3 1.5%.) ??Most important, Cal-ISO is pledging to provide 30-minute notice of probable blackouts to people in the areas served by Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric, among others. In addition to giving the warnings on the Internet and through the mass media, Cal-ISO will sound alarms to select e-mail addresses and pager numbers on ""blast lists,"" or massive computer databases that it will assemble. ??""The technology is there. This is a war California is in, and we should be deploying high-tech solutions,"" said Carl Guardino of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group, the Cal-ISO board member who had been pushing hardest for better notification. ""Every time California goes black, the economy sees red."" ??Guardino said that businesses and public agencies are now receiving just two- to six-minute warnings before blackouts, not nearly enough to react. ??""A two-minute warning may be sufficient in a football game, but it is insufficient to protect California businesses and the public,"" he said. ??Though businesses and government agencies are expected to make the most of the warnings, Florio said residents also will benefit. ??""It will be more of a challenge to get the information to individual homeowners, but if someone works at home, and sets it up to get an e-mail notice, they can take advantage,"" he said. ??In other energy news Monday, the woman in charge of paying California's power bills warned that a $13.4-billion bond issue to cover electricity purchases will be insufficient and that the state will have to borrow $4 billion more before it runs out of cash in February. ??Calling a news conference in the capital, state Controller Kathleen Connell questioned the key assumptions underpinning Gov. Gray Davis' financial plan for overcoming the energy crisis. The plan assumes the $13.4 billion in bond sales will repay state coffers for electricity purchases and cover future power buys for the next two years. ??Connell's opinion is notable because, as the state's chief check writer, the independently elected Democrat is privy to information about the prices the state is paying for electricity bought on the spot market and through long-term contracts--data that Davis has largely kept secret. ??Davis' advisors and Department of Finance officials dispute Connell's warnings.

Long commutes. Mediocre schools. Housing costs. At the Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area, the Valley's answer to Central Park, such ordinary concerns about money, time and resources stretched too thin for comfort tumbled out again and again during interviews with some two dozen people visiting this green oasis. ??Sprawling northwest from the tangled junction of the San Diego and Ventura freeways, the recreation area is a pastoral patchwork of three golf courses bracketed by Woodley Avenue Park to the east and Lake Balboa to the west. It hardly looks like a battleground, but the 2,000-acre park straddles something of a political fault line in the mayoral contest. ??Both candidates in the June 5 runoff, former state legislator Antonio Villaraigosa and City Atty. James K. Hahn, have staked out the Valley as prime campaign turf, packed with thousands of up-for-grabs voters whose affections might well tip the race. ??And the Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area is wedged between an electoral no man's land--a southern ribbon of the Valley where about 60% of voters shunned both men in the election's first round--and a central Valley region where Villaraigosa took first place in April, beating Hahn by roughly a 2-to-1 margin. ??Between them, the candidates are expected to spend more than $10 million by election day to get their messages out. But it's not clear whether these impassioned appeals are reaching their intended targets. ??Less than a month before the election, many people here are preoccupied with concerns that have little to do with City Hall. And when they do voice interest in local matters, some seem unable to connect these issues to a candidate. ??For instance, several Valley voters interviewed in the park in early May said that knotted traffic on the San Diego Freeway was a major problem. But no one mentioned a plan Villaraigosa unveiled in March to buy hundreds of new buses and slash fares in a sweeping bid to cut vehicle traffic, or a proposal from Hahn to add more carpool lanes on freeways. ??Which raises a fundamental challenge for would-be mayors: Sometimes, there's just too much going on in everyday life to tune in to city politics. ""I know I ought to,"" many people confess sheepishly, ""but I just haven't gotten around to it yet."" ??Take Randye Sandel, 58, a blond and bespectacled oil painter from Valley Village. Sandel said she plans to vote for Hahn, ""a known quantity"" in City Hall, but a moment later admits that she might change her mind. The thing is, Sandel adds, she's been really busy setting up an art exhibition at a Santa Monica gallery and has yet to research her mayoral options. ""I've been totally immersed in my own life,"" she said. ??Same goes for Harold Seay, a muscular golfer heading back to his car after playing 18 holes. The 44-year-old music teacher from Encino said he's had his hands full for weeks rehearsing graduation recitals for a Brentwood private school. ""The news is the last thing I'm paying attention to,"" he said. ??But both voters can easily rattle off their most pressing concerns. Sandel, who used to teach art at Valley College, said she is particularly worried about education. ??""The last few semesters I taught, I was horrified by the academic preparedness of the students. They were practically illiterate,"" she said. ""They couldn't take notes from my lecture because they didn't understand the vocabulary. That bothers me a lot. Who's going to inherit this country?"" ??Seay, who recently moved to Los Angeles from Miami, said he is troubled by the air pollution and racial tension he has encountered here. Seay is African American and his wife is Italian, he said, and their 9-year-old daughter is ""stuck half-and-half,"" caught in what Seay regards as a troubling black-white divide. ""That black-white thing really turns me off,"" he said. ""I care about people getting along."" ??As the mayoral race hurtles into its final weeks, some of Hahn and Villaraigosa's most spirited skirmishes have erupted over crime and law enforcement issues. Each man is trying to burnish his own crime-fighting credentials while accusing his rival of neglecting public safety. ??The candidates have squabbled especially fiercely over compressed work schedules for police officers--the notion of squashing the police workweek into three 12-hour days, or possibly four 10-hour days. The Police Protective League endorsed Hahn, who supports the so-called 3-12 schedule favored by the union. Villaraigosa, whom Hahn has often characterized as soft on crime, seized upon the scheduling issue to retaliate, arguing that the three-day week would jeopardize public safety. ??But interviews with people visiting the Valley's biggest park revealed that crime--which has declined significantly since Mayor Richard Riordan took office eight years ago--was not the main issue weighing on these voters' minds. That distinction belongs to something that has walloped wallets far and wide across this car-addled city: the soaring price of gasoline. ??As he cooled down after a six-mile run near Balboa Lake, Ray Verdugo summed up the problem facing many gas-guzzlers as prices approached $2 a gallon: ""I made a big mistake and bought a big SUV,"" lamented the retired Rocketdyne engineer from Winnetka. ""I'm on a fixed income, and [gasoline prices] keep going up all the time."" ??Big-city mayors, to be sure, wield minimal influence over gasoline pumps. Gas prices are swayed by market forces, including the international cost of crude oil, rising demand and limited refinery capacity. Nonetheless, about a third of voters interviewed as they ambled around the Sepulveda Basin named gas prices as a top concern. Half as many said they were worried about crime. ??Some voters said they were troubled by California's electricity woes, although Los Angeles residents have been spared shortages and blackouts because the city's municipal utility avoided deregulation. ??""I think building more power plants would help,"" said Julie Erickson, 27, a figure-skating instructor from Reseda. ??And then there are the things that people aren't talking about. Nobody (at least nobody in an admittedly unscientific sample of voters culled over two days in the Sepulveda Basin) mentioned the Rampart police scandal or the recruiting problems crippling the Los Angeles Police Department. ??No one uttered so much as a peep about neighborhood councils, that much-ballyhooed innovation of the new city charter. Even the Valley secession movement--which Villaraigosa has pointed to as ""the biggest challenge facing Los Angeles""--hardly earned an honorable mention from this cross-section of Valleyites. Only one voter referred to secession at all, saying that she favored it. ??Instead, many people voiced personal gripes, the kind of woes unlikely to vault to the center of the mayoral radar screen--but issues that nonetheless embody the high quality of life both candidates envision for Los Angeles. ??One man, a sunburned golfer who lives in Van Nuys, said he's dismayed that the city hasn't finished building a new golf clubhouse and restaurant at the Woodley Lakes Golf Course. Another frequent park visitor, a retired housekeeper from Sherman Oaks, complained about the windblown litter she sees as she walks her dog around Balboa Lake. ??But some problems vexing these voters seem frankly beyond the grasp of even the most poll-tested candidate. ??Sandel, the oil painter, got downright metaphysical after a good 15 minutes spent mulling the troubles facing Los Angeles, and indeed the world. Technology, she concluded, was advancing so rapidly that it was crowding out humanity's intuitive, spiritual side. ??""I think there's an extraordinary sense of collective despair and psychological uncertainty smoldering just below the surface,"" she said.

The agency also promised to give 30 minutes' warning before it orders utility companies to pull the plug on homes and businesses, a move that could prevent traffic accidents, stuck elevators and costly shutdowns at factories. ??Up to now, the agency has refused to give more than a few minutes' warning, saying it did not want to alarm people when there was still a chance that a last-minute purchase of power could stave off blackouts. The utility companies also have resisted giving warnings, saying they did not want to tip off burglars and other criminals. ??""People are asking for additional notice, so we're doing our best to make that a reality,"" said Lorie O'Donley, a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator. ??The state's power system, crippled by a botched effort at deregulation, has been unable to produce or buy enough electricity to power air conditioners on hot days. The rolling blackouts move from neighborhood to neighborhood in a sequence that is determined by the utility companies and is difficult for the public to predict. The outages last 60 to 90 minutes and then skip to another neighborhood. ??Because of the lack of notice, the six days of rolling blackouts so far this year have led to pileups at intersections suddenly left without stoplights, people trapped in elevators, and losses caused by stopped production lines. People with home medical equipment fret that they will be cut off without warning. ??The new plan borrows from the language of weather forecasters: Beginning May 30 the ISO will issue a ""power watch"" or ""power warning"" that will give notice the grid could be headed toward blackouts. It will issue a 30-minute warning to the media and others before any blackouts begin but will not say what neighborhoods will be hit. ??""Any time is better than none,"" said Bill Dombrowski, president of the California Retailers Association.

Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana (Orange County), who heads a special committee reviewing energy prices, called the ""ramping"" allegations, first disclosed in The Chronicle on Sunday, ""outrageous acts of manipulation."" ???Dunn said that even if the practices did not violate current law, legislation could be drafted to make such acts illegal in the future. ???""We're looking at it, yes, from the point of view of civil or criminal statutes that may exist but also whether legislation should be introduced to render it a violation for future such acts."" ???Dunn's committee already has been investigating charges that power generators ""gamed"" the wholesale energy market to boost their profits. ???The Chronicle reported Sunday that power companies used a complex tactic to alter the output of their plants, sometimes several times within an hour. ???Sources who work in the plants said the ploy enabled the companies to drive up the prices they receive for electricity. The firms avoided detection by still meeting the terms of their contracts, which required them to supply a certain amount of power each hour. The sources said the tactic greatly contributed to deteriorating physical conditions at the plants, leading to the record level of outages now plaguing California plants. ???The senate committee, which convened in March after The Chronicle reported that power companies had overstated the growth in demand for electricity in California, has obtained confidential bidding and generation data for power-generating companies. Dunn said the data will be analyzed to determine which plants employed the ramping tactic. He added that the issue would be examined in a public hearing in the coming weeks. ???Meanwhile, pressure continued to mount on generating companies that drove electricity supplies through the roof during the past year. ???Sources said the California Public Utilities Commission, which is investigating allegedly unnecessary plant shutdowns, has narrowed its focus. It is targeting several plants that had no apparent defects yet went offline during periods when prices were rising because of limited electricity supplies. ???Commissioner Jeff Brown said the names of these plants are under court seal. However, Dow Jones reported yesterday that one of them was a San Diego-area plant co-owned by Dynegy Inc. of Houston and NRG Inc. of Minneapolis. Another was a Pittsburg plant owned by Mirant Corp. of Atlanta. The companies denied the allegations. ???On another front, Sen. John Burton, D-San Francisco, and Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks (Los Angeles County), were expected to file a lawsuit this morning against the Federal Energy Regulatory Committee for failing to carry out its stated duty of ensuring ""just and reasonable"" electricity rates. ???""Their central failing is that they don't follow the law,"" Burton said in an interview. ""Either they're letting their friends within the industry or their ideology get in the way of their public responsibility."" ???The California attorney general's office also is pressing forward with an investigation into the practices of wholesale power companies.

A1 LENGTH: 1527 words HEADLINE: Half-hour notice of blackouts planned; FAST ALERTS: Power grid operator may send voice, e-mail messages SOURCE: Chronicle Sacramento Bureau BYLINE: Lynda Gledhill DATELINE: Sacramento BODY: Californians will receive 30 minutes' warning that blackouts may be imposed -- enough time, it is hoped, to get out of the elevator or through a dangerous intersection, the state's power grid managers said yesterday. ???The California Independent System Operator also will provide a daily power forecast 24 hours in advance so residents and businesses can plan for blackouts the same way people prepare for severe storms. ???""We want a system that is proactive,"" said Carl Guardino, an ISO board member and president of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group. ""When the last few rolling blackouts hit there was as little as two minutes' warning. Two minutes may be fine in a football game, but it's not fine for California's economy or safety."" ???ISO officials also said they are examining high-tech ways of quickly spreading the word about impending blackouts to homeowners and businesses through mass e-mails, faxes, automated phone calls and pager messages. ???The plan, detailed in a report issued yesterday, still falls far short of other proposals being pushed in the Legislature. Lawmakers have suggested scheduling blackout days months in advance and having California join with other Western states to form a ""buyer's cartel"" that would refuse to pay for power when prices become too high. ???""It's not the report I was expecting, but 30 minutes of notice is certainly better than two,"" said Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Ray. ""No matter how you slice it, this summer is going to be miserable. The question is whether we want to have planned misery or unplanned misery."" ???A spokesman for the California Manufacturers and Technology Association, which commissioned a recent report that found unplanned blackouts could cost the state economy $21.8 billion, said the ISO policy changes will be a tremendous help to many businesses. ???""In this electrically unreliable world, any notification manufacturers can get is good,"" said Gino DeCaro, a spokesman for the association. ""While 30 minutes won't be enough for some, for most manufacturers it will be sufficient."" The ISO will wait for guidance from the governor and lawmakers regarding more complicated issues such as the creation of scheduled blackouts, said Michael Florio, an ISO board member and official at The Utility Reform Network. ???""There are bigger public policy ramifications,"" Florio said. ???The ideas will be discussed in greater detail at an ISO board meeting Thursday. Stephanie McCorkle, an ISO spokeswoman, said the changes are just updates of policies already in place. ???WARNING OF 'PROBABLE' BLACKOUTS ???The 30-minute advance-notification system, scheduled to go into effect early next month, would warn of ""probable"" blackouts, including the amount of load that will have to be curtailed in each service area. ???Until now, the agency has refused to give more than a few minutes' warning, saying it did not want to alarm people when there was still a chance that a last-minute purchase of power could stave off blackouts. The utilities also have resisted giving warnings, saying they did not want to tip off burglars and other criminals. ???The ISO also has been working to upgrade its Web site to provide the most current information about how much electricity is being used and how much is available. It will also establish a system this summer through which that information can be sent in an hourly e-mail. ???This information may make it easier for larger users of electricity to plan their operations, said ISO spokeswoman Lorie O'Donley. ???Also planned by the ISO is a ""Power Watch/Power Warning"" system that would provide a 24-hour notice of high-demand days. ???Under the two-tiered system, a ""Power Watch"" would be declared whenever a Stage One or Stage Two alert is likely, while a ""Power Warning"" would be issued whenever there is at least a 50 percent chance of a Stage Three alert. ???With one report suggesting California may see as many as 700 hours of rolling blackouts this summer, lawmakers are hard at work trying to find ways to make the outages easier for power customers to cope with. ???The idea of a buyer's cartel, the subject of a Capitol hearing today, would have California -- in partnership with other states -- set a firm ceiling on what it will pay power producers for electricity this summer -- and not one dime more. ???The idea, which has attracted the support of some key lawmakers and the cautious interest of Gov. Gray Davis, could potentially curtail the exorbitantly high prices the state has been paying for electricity. ???The trade-off would be the likelihood of more frequent blackouts than if the state continues to pay any price electricity sellers demand. ???The maximum the state would pay would be set by a formula, based on such things as the cost of natural gas. A reasonable profit for power producers would be built in, supporters said. ???DESIGNATING BLACKOUT DAYS ???Meanwhile, Assemblyman Mike Briggs, R-Fresno, will introduce a bill today that would require the state's utilities and Public Utilities Commission to designate days for potential blackouts to each block. ???For example, a customer located in Block 3 of Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s service area could be told in advance that power will be turned off June 5 if blackouts are needed that day. ???""Right now, every day is a potential blackout day,"" Briggs said. ""This way people would know when their potential days are."" ??On alert ???-- When demand is high, the ISO will forecast peak demand, power supply and weather 24 hours in advance. ???-- A ""power watch"" will be issued when it is likely the grid will reach Stage 1 (system is within 7% of running out of power) or Stage 2 (system is within 5% of running out of power). ???-- A ""power warning"" will be issued when there is at least a 50% chance of a Stage 3 alert (demand is within 1.5% of supply). ???Who calls a blackout? ???Engineers in Folsom at the Independent System Operator keep watch on the state's power consumption. When they determine that energy reserves have dipped below 1.5 percent of available capacity, the ISO can order utilities to start cutting juice. Officials said this week they would give 30 minutes' notice before blackouts begin. The ISO tells the utilities exactly how much power to cut. ???Q: Who decides who gets blacked out and for how long? ???A: That's up to the utilities. PG&E has divided its 4.5 million customers into 14 blocks; each block is darkened for one to two hours at a time. The blocks are defined by PG&E's network of circuits rather than by geography. Thus, neighborhoods in San Francisco, Oakland and Pleasant Hill can be blacked out simultaneously. ???Q: How many users are blacked out at once? ???A: Each of PG&E's 14 ???blocks represents about 550 megawatts of electricity. (A megawatt is enough electricity to power 1,000 homes.) If PG&E is told to cut more than 550 megawatts, it can shut down two or more blocks at a time. PG&E also can black out smaller portions within each block if the ISO's requirements are for less than 550 megawatts. ???Q: How is power shut off? ???A: This is a straightforward matter of shutting off circuits in a power substation by computer or sending a crew to flip the switches by hand. ???Q: How many days of blackouts have we had this year and how many customers have been affected? ???A: A total of 3,035,000 customers have been blacked out in the six days of rolling blackouts since Jan. 1, 2001. ???Q: Which block of customers will be blacked out next? ???A: Some or all customers in Block 1. ???Q: How do I know what block I'm in? ???A: Look for the words ""Rotating Outage Block"" followed by a number on your bill. If it says Block 50, you share an electrical circuit with a hospital, police station or other ""essential service"" that is normally exempt from service cuts. ???Q: What should I do when the lights go out? ???A: Power experts advise: ???-- Turn off all lights and appliances to prevent damage-causing power surges when service is restored. Leave one light on to indicate when the electricity is back. ???-- Use caution when driving because traffic signals may be out. Treat all intersections as a four-way stop. ???-- To protect food, open refrigerator and freezer doors only when absolutely necessary. ???-- Keep a flashlight and radio with fresh batteries available. If you light candles, observe the usual safety precautions. ???-- If the lights go out, check with neighbors to determine if only your home is affected. It may be a downed power line or some other problem, in which case you should alert PG&E or your city electrical bureau. ???-- When the power returns, turn on one appliance at a time to prevent power surges. ???-- Don't plug a generator into the wall; when the lights return, it can send a high-voltage current through the system that can electrocute power workers. ???-- Tell children who are home alone to remain calm, to turn off the TV and computers, and not to use candles. ???Sources: PG&E, Chronicle staff ???Chronicle Graphic ??E-mail Lynda Gledhill at lgledhill@sfchronicle.com.

""And he's got to stop looking so cozy with business."" ??The president's proposal emphasizes stepped-up production and modest conservation measures. It received mixed reviews from an anxious public that appears to want quick relief but sees the plan only helping after several years. ??Although Bush says his program will allow Americans to retain the lifestyle they are accustomed to, only 30% of those surveyed said they believe it. Two of three said major lifestyle changes will be necessary to solve the nation's energy woes. ??Nearly half said the Bush plan would not do enough to conserve energy, and 43% said the plan would do too little to increase production. ??Americans also were split over the Bush proposal to increase the number of nuclear power plants to generate electricity: 49% for and 46% against. ??The tepid response to the Bush energy plan might have been a factor in raising his job-disapproval rating from 31% a week ago to 36% now, the highest of his presidency. His 56% job-approval rating did not change from a week ago. ??Bush's strongest disapproval came from Democrats, low-income earners, women under 50 and residents of California, a state wrestling with electricity shortages. ??California Democratic Gov. Gray Davis was highly critical of the Bush plan. He said it ""does nothing to address the astronomical run-up in the prices of electricity, natural gas and gasoline (and) favors more energy production at the expense of everything else."" ??White House spokesman Claire Buchan said the president will continue to press his plan, regardless of the polls: ""The president does not govern by polls. This is a serious issue that has been neglected for years, and he has begun a serious dialogue with the American people. It will continue."" ??Most poll respondents said they see threats of electricity shortages and the rising price of gasoline and heating fuels as serious problems, although only 12% said they see a ""state of crisis."" And most of those polled said Bush is not doing enough to address those problems. ??At the same time, most said energy companies have too much influence over the administration's energy polices, an argument Democrats raise. ??One in five said the Bush administration deserves a great deal of blame for the energy problems; 28% put a great deal of that blame on the Clinton administration.

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Californians will soon be waking up to the weather, the traffic and a blackout forecast. ??The operator of the state's electricity grid said Monday that it will start issuing forecasts 24 hours ahead of expected rolling blackouts. ??The agency also promised to give 30 minutes' warning before it orders utilities to pull the plug on homes and businesses, a move that could prevent traffic accidents, stuck elevators and costly shutdowns at factories. ??Up to now, the agency has refused to give more than a few minutes' warning, saying it did not want to alarm people when there was still a chance that a last-minute purchase of power could stave off blackouts. The utilities have also resisted giving warnings, saying they did not want to tip off criminals. ??""People are asking for additional notice, so we're doing our best to make that a reality,"" said Lorie O'Donley, a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator. ??Californians have been warned that rolling blackouts could be a regular feature this summer. The state's power system, crippled by a botched effort at deregulation, has been unable to produce or buy enough electricity to power air conditioners on hot days. ??The rolling blackouts move from neighborhood to neighborhood in a sequence that is determined by the utilities and is difficult or impossible for the public to predict. The outages last 60 to 90 minutes and then skip to another neighborhood. ??Because of the lack of notice, the six days of rolling blackouts to hit the state so far this year have led to pileups at intersections suddenly left without stoplights, people trapped in elevators and losses caused by stopped production lines. People with home medical equipment like oxygen fret they that they will be cut off without warning. ??The new plan by the ISO borrows from the language of weather forecasters: Beginning May 30, it will issue a ""power watch"" or ""power warning"" that will give notice the grid could be headed toward blackouts. ??The ISO will issue 30-minute warnings to the media and others before any blackouts begin. However, the ISO will not say what neighborhoods will be hit. ??""Any time is better than none,"" said Bill Dombrowski, president of the California Retailers Association. ""Obviously, we'd like more, but we're realistic about what they can do."" ??The plan falls far short of what some consumer groups and legislators are demanding. ??State Sen. Debra Bowen has said she envisions giving consumers three to five days' notice that their power will be cut during a particular period, so businesses could shut down or shift their operations to non-peak hours such as nights and weekends.

The plant, owned by local power wholesaler Pinnacle West Energy, will produce enough electricity to serve about 120,000 homes, though much of it may be sold elsewhere. ??On Monday, PG&E National Energy Group, a sister of California's financially squeezed PG&E Gas and Electric, broke ground for its planned $500 million generating plant west of Phoenix that will use natural gas. ??It's one of up to 11 plants planned for Arizona by out-of-state interests. Three such plants are expected to begin production this summer, though much of their power also may be sold to other states. ??That's true of the PG&E National plant, too, but those who live in the vicinity don't care. ??""We have nothing out here now,"" said Elisa Bigbey of Harquahala Valley. ""We want to get something going."" ??The plant will increase the assessed valuation of the area by 17 times and will generate $10.7 million in new property taxes. PG&E already has given the local school district a portable shed in which to store records because the district's only school was damaged by a November fire. ??PG&E also is making a no-strings outright gift to the community of $550,000 in 11 annual cash installments. A committee of local residents will decide how to spend the windfall. ??Meanwhile, Panda Energy of Dallas and Teco Power Services of Tampa, Fla., recently broke ground for a plant south of the PG&E site, and Duke Energy North America of Charlotte, N.C., and Sempra Energy of San Diego each have started plants in the Arlington Valley. ??Pinnacle West Generating has a plant under construction near the Palo Verde nuclear plant in this same general area. ??Additionally, the Desert Basin Plant in Casa Grande is owned by Reliant Energy of Houston. The Griffith Energy Plant near Kingman is owned by Duke Energy and P&L Global. The Southpoint plant, set to begin production next month near Bullhead City, is owned by Calpine Corp. of San Jose. ??Such plants have come to Arizona because there's lot of space in Arizona, water is relatively inexpensive, there's access to natural gas, regulators are friendly and the plants can be situated at a distance from urban air pollution controls. ??The PG&E plant will produce nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxides that can lead to formation of ozone, an air pollution problem against Phoenix has been fighting for years. ??Additionally, the plant will use 6,500 acre feet of water a year, enough to meet the needs of a town of about 30,000. PG&E expects to use surplus Central Arizona Project water from the distant Colorado River - but the Harquahala Valley has a good supply of underground water PG&E can tap if the CAP surplus disappears.

The Independent System Operator will also be issuing a daily energy forecast with projected supply and demand, and the likelihood of blackouts. Several lawmakers say they'll introduce plans that would give Californians even more notice of blackouts - from one day to one month. ??- The state auditor releases a report on the state's energy crisis, saying previous estimates that the state could avoid blackouts this summer are overly optimistic. The Bureau of State Audits also criticized the California Public Utilities Commission, saying the commission hasn't responded to the crisis by expediting transmission line project. ??- Gov. Gray Davis is in Chicago, speaking with city officials there about blackout procedures. ??- Davis' energy advisers say that the state is meeting its energy goals, despite doubts raised by Controller Kathleen Connell and other critics. Connell questioned whether the state can buy enough electricity cheap enough to avoid borrowing more than the $13.4 billion approved by state lawmakers. But Davis adviser Joe Fichera says the state has signed more long-term power contracts that will help keep prices low. ??- Davis' office announces that an eighth ""peaker"" power plant has been licensed. The 135-megawatt plant in Gilroy is expected to be online by the end of September. The California Energy Commission says that more than 10,000 megawatts of new electricity since April 1999. ??- The California Energy Commission also announces increased rebates for renewable energy systems - such as solar panels, fuel cells or small wind generation. Rebates of up to 50 percent on the system are available for residential, commercial, industrial or agricultural users. ??- Republican legislative leaders criticize Davis for spending tax money on a political communications firm that previously advised Vice President Al Gore. Davis is hiring Gore's former press secretary and deputy campaign manager for six months at $30,000 a month to coordinate the governor's communications on energy issues. Senate GOP Leader Jim Brulte and Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox say Davis should pay them with campaign funds, not taxpayers' money. ??- Shares of Edison International closed at $11.23, down 51 cents. PG&E Corp. dropped 48 cents to close at $11.16. ??WHAT'S NEXT: ??- Davis' representatives continue negotiating with Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas and Electric Co., to buy the utility's transmission lines. ??- Davis is scheduled to sign a bill Tuesday that would expedite power plant siting. ??- Republican Assemblyman Mike Briggs plans to introduce a bill that would allow people to know a month ahead if they will be affected by rolling blackouts. ??THE PROBLEM: ??High demand, high wholesale energy costs, transmission glitches and a tight supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in the Northwest and maintenance at aging California power plants are all factors in California's electricity crisis. ??Edison and PG&E say they've lost nearly $14 billion since June to high wholesale prices the state's electricity deregulation law bars them from passing on to consumers. PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. ??Electricity and natural gas suppliers, scared off by the two companies' poor credit ratings, are refusing to sell to them, leading the state in January to start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and business customers. The state is also buying power for a third investor-owned utility, San Diego Gas & Electric, which is in better financial shape than much larger Edison and PG&E but also struggling with high wholesale power costs. ??The Public Utilities Commission has approved average rate increases of 36 percent for residential customers and 38 percent for commercial customers, and hikes of up to 49 percent for industrial customers and 15 or 20 percent for agricultural customers to help finance the state's multibillion-dollar power buys.

The outages last 60 to 90 minutes and then skip to another neighborhood. ??Because of the lack of notice, the six days of rolling blackouts to hit the state so far this year have led to pileups at intersections suddenly left without stoplights, trapped people in elevators, and caused business losses by bringing production lines to a halt. People with home medical equipment like oxygen fret they that they will be cut off without warning. ??The new plan by the ISO borrows from the language of weather forecasters: It will issue a ""power watch"" or ""power warning"" that will give notice the grid could be headed toward blackouts. ??The ISO will issue 30-minute warning to the media and others before any blackouts actually begin. However, the ISO will not say what neighborhoods will be hit. ??""It's better than no notice,"" said John Handley of California Independent Grocers. ??He said stores could use the warning to rush customers through checkout and even move items to cold storage if necessary. ??""Once the power goes out, we can't ring anyone up,"" Handley said. ??Many small factories have production lines that cannot be interrupted without risk to an entire lot of whatever they produce, said Brad Ward, president and chief executive of the Small Manufacturers Association of California. ??For example, a manufacturer might be using acid to etch something on a piece of metal. If power is shut off suddenly, the acid might not be removed in time and the piece would be ruined. ??""This is really, really good news,"" Ward said. ??The ISO said it also is looking into high-tech ways it can get word of an impending blackout quickly to homeowners and businesses through mass e-mails, faxes, automated phone calls and pager messages. ??On the Net: ??California Independent System Operator: http://www.caiso.com LOAD-DATE: May 22, 2001 of 85 DOCUMENTS 2001 Associated Press Online 21, 2001; Monday SECTION: Domestic, non-Washington, general news item LENGTH: 793 words HEADLINE: ?AP Top News at 7 p.m. EDT Monday, May 21, 2001 BYLINE: ADAM JOYCE BODY: ??Ford to Recall Millions of Tires ??WASHINGTON (AP) ??Ford Motor Co. plans to replace 10 million to 13 million Firestone tires, far surpassing the already huge recall ordered last summer by Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., auto industry sources told The Associated Press today.

It is at once a triumph of technology and Western gumption, and a reminder of how tenuous it all is. ??The great growth in the West followed a simple recipe: Water plus power equals population. There was always a feeling that the land was so big you couldn't use it up, not the resources, not the space. ??Today there are signs that's no longer true. In California, blackouts. In Oregon and Washington, drought. In Arizona, arsons to stop construction. And in every rearview mirror, more traffic all the time. ??The allure of vast prairies, open skies and endless opportunity is what first drew people out West. But as deserts disappear under development, possibilities become problems. ??Now, with its infrastructure strained by growth, the West faces difficult choices: Energy or environment? Freeways or orchards? Water for people or fish? ??""We're losing what we've come for, this ideal,"" says James Corless, California director of the Surface Transportation Policy Project, which aims to diversify transportation systems to reduce traffic and pollution caused by growth. ""And we are loath to change."" ??--- ??When the streets went dark in California, a light bulb came on across the West. ??The region saw its vulnerability. For one very important resource, demand had won out over supply. What about all the others? ??""We've got an infrastructure that can't really carry much additional power. We're starting to see the same situation with water,"" says John Maddox, president of the Denver-based Center for the New West. ??And people keep coming. ??The West added more than 10 million people in the 1990s, making it the fastest-growing region in the United States. In the next decade, another 10 million are expected. ??""What does that mean?"" Maddox says. ""How many new roads, new water infrastructure and treatment facilities, how many new runways and airports?"" ??Perhaps more than clogged freeways and periodic droughts, the power crisis has brought home the reality that there are limits to growth. ??In California, electricity consumption rose 24 percent in the past five years as the economy grew by 29 percent. However, no major new plants were built in the state in the past 10 years, according to Cambridge Energy Research Associates. ??Several projects to generate new power were shelved in the 1990s, because of regulatory red-tape, environmental protests, economics and wariness over the state's deregulation plan. ??As a result, the power ran low and California was forced to go to the open market in search of electricity, sending power rates soaring and shutting out the lights in rolling blackouts. ??California officials now predict it will take two to three years before energy production catches up with demand. ??Meanwhile, the crisis has crossed state lines. In the Northwest, generating capacity grew 4 percent in the 1990s, while demand grew 24 percent. That wasn't a problem when abundant rain and snow produced above-average hydropower generation between 1995 and 2000. ??Then drought hit, and generation dropped. Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana are about 3,000 megawatts short of the electricity they need. ??Now everyone's playing catch-up. California is on a plant-building spree, while other states are pushing conservation and looking for alternative fuel sources. ??Even in power-hungry Las Vegas, the mega-resorts are cutting back. The MGM Grand refitted its 5,000 guest rooms with low-watt fluorescent bulbs and changed its casino-floor lighting. Treasure Island's parking garage is switching to sodium bulbs that use 30 percent less energy. ??But a feeling of dread is gripping some Westerners. If the lights can go out, what's next? Dry faucets? ??""The thing I worry about is water,"" says Carol Ann Heggie-Hall, a retired science teacher who moved from Queens, N.Y., to Henderson, Nev., in 1999. ""Is there enough water for everyone and their plants?"" ??Much of the West is facing the worst drought in a quarter-century, prompting warnings of environmental degradation, forest fires and agricultural decline. Nevertheless, experts say the West isn't in danger of running out of water. The challenge is determining who gets how much. ??""It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that if the faucets ran dry in Scottsdale, there are places to go to get water,"" says Joe Hunter, a power and water specialist at the Center for the New West. ""But it means shifting it from one use to another."" ??About 80 percent of water in most Western states is used to irrigate crops, a percentage that could drop if residential supplies were strained, Hunter says. ??Western states and cities must also do more to share water. ??California has long used more than its allocation from the Colorado River, which supplies drinking water to seven Western states. An agreement allows California to receive surplus water if it implements conservation measures that will reduce its reliance on the river in the future. ??In the meantime, Western cities are looking elsewhere to sustain the supply. The Las Vegas Valley predicts it will reach its annual Colorado River allocation by 2007, so its regional water authority is negotiating to store 1.2 million acre feet of water in Arizona for the next 15 years. ??Beyond power and water, other infrastructure problems persist. In the Vegas area, which added 700,000 people in the '90s, road closures due to highway expansions are a daily occurrence. ??""There are few roads you can drive on that aren't under construction,"" admits Jim Gibson, mayor of Henderson, a city south of Vegas that is among the country's most rapidly growing communities. ??Without the new roads, Vegas transportation officials estimate there would be 2,289 miles of congestion by the year 2025, compared with 341 miles last year. ??Highways alleviate congestion, but also drive more growth. ??Interstate 5, the north-south freeway through Washington and Oregon, became a growth magnet. In Colorado, Interstate 70 has opened the mountains to staggering growth west of Denver. ??-- ??In the fastest-growing metro area in the fastest-growing state in the fastest-growing region of the country, Greg Cox and Dale Stark are unloading dirt on a Las Vegas street crammed with construction workers. ??The landscapers are a rare breed in a town teeming with newcomers: Cox has lived here all his life; Stark moved from Southern California in 1979. ??Both grumble about the changes they've seen, and both vow to leave. ??""I moved here when this town was nice,"" Stark says. ""Now you can't drive down the road without getting cut off and flipped off."" ??Cox complains he can barely get around at all. A drive across town used to take 20 minutes. Now, he grunts, ""You've got to pack a lunch."" ??Both agree: Even Las Vegas, the city built on the very idea of unlimited resources and space, is reaching its limits. ??The sentiment is spreading across the West: Unbridled growth must stop. ??Planning experts insist cities must reinvest in old neighborhoods rather than build new ones, and provide incentive to plan for growth in a way that incorporates existing infrastructure. ??Portland, Ore., has been a national leader with its urban growth boundary. In San Francisco, a program provides federal money to developers who build homes near transit stops. ??Still, when initiatives to rein in growth were placed on the ballot in several Western states last November, most of the big measures failed - including one in Arizona to force developers to pay for new infrastructure. Opponents warned that growth controls would be bad for business. ??In Las Vegas, despite infrastructure challenges, the official line remains that growth is good. ??""As long as you can take care of the social problems and quality of life problems, there's never such a thing as too much growth,"" declares Mayor Oscar Goodman. ""Once you stop growing, you stagnate."" ??And so for now, the fountains flow, the marquees shine. ??And the people keep coming. ??On the Net: ??Center for the New West: www.newwest.org/ ??Sierra Club sprawl campaign: ??Census stats: ??Las Vegas growth topics website: ??Surface Transportation Policy Project: http://www.transact.org/ ??Brookings Institution's Center on Urban and Metropolitan Policy: ??EDITOR'S NOTE - Pauline Arrillaga is the AP's Southwest regional writer, based in Phoenix. ??End ADV for May 26-27 GRAPHIC: AP Photos NY372-375 of May 21, AP Graphic WESTERN GROWTH, AP LOAD-DATE: May 22, 2001 of 85 DOCUMENTS Associated Press The materials in the AP file were compiled by The Associated Press. ?These materials may not be republished without the express written consent of The Associated Press. ????????????????????????May 21, 2001, Monday, BC cycle SECTION: Domestic News; Business News LENGTH: 648 words HEADLINE: California will forecast blackouts and warn the public BYLINE: By JENNIFER COLEMAN, Associated Press Writer DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif.

And if generators don't lower the price, the state should schedule blackouts to cut consumption, he said. ??The report by Navarro and the Utility Consumers' Action Network says the state's current method of ""highly disruptive random rolling blackouts"" needs to be revamped. ??UCAN suggests that the state be divided into blackout zones that utilities could notify ahead of time that power would be cut at a specific time and for a certain duration. ??Scheduling blackouts could attract criminals to outage areas, Keeley acknowledged, and possibly could subject the state to legal liability for traffic accidents or other incidents if power is deliberately shut off. ??""That is a genuine problem and genuine concern,"" Keeley said. ""I think we would have to work with local governments so they could have a sufficient advance notice to be able to foresee that and try to deploy their resources appropriately."" ??Critics of the planned blackouts said power producers simply could sell their unused electricity to other states, or trim back production to keep supplies short. ??Assemblyman Mike Briggs, R-Fresno, plans to introduce a bill this week that would have the Public Utilities Commission notify businesses and homeowners as much as one month ahead of time when they would have their power cut. ??""We owe the people of this state some kind of schedule,"" Briggs said. ""If businesses and individuals knew what days their power could potentially be shut off or blacked out, they could plan for that blackout accordingly."" ??The Central Valley Republican said the ability to plan for outages would be especially benefit farmers, who need power to irrigate their crops. ??Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, who convened a special subcommittee on blackouts, has also suggested the state should consider scheduling daily blackouts to cut the state's power use and drive down prices. Democratic Assembly members plan to introduce their own version of a blackout plan. ??Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey, has said she envisions giving consumers three to five days notice that their power will be cut during a particular period, so businesses could opt to shut down or shift their operations to nonpeak hours such as nights and weekends. ??And by treating blackouts as a first option rather than a last resort, the state could cut its peak power needs and drive down prices, Bowen said. California power consumers would in essence form ""a reverse cartel to stop the market manipulation and the price gouging,"" she said. ??The planned blackout suggestions come as state officials grow increasingly concerned that power prices will keep rising this summer, even beyond the extraordinary levels the state already has been paying on behalf of three cash-strapped privately owned utilities. ??Gov. Gray Davis said the state paid $1,900 per megawatt hour at one point last week. ??The state has dedicated $6.7 billion since mid-January to purchase power for Pacific Gas and Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric. ??Those expenditures will be repaid this summer when the state issues $13.4 billion in revenue bonds.

The PUC figures around half of PG&E and Edison customers now fall into that category. ??But consumer rights groups, and even the utilities, think the PUC is underestimating residential electric use, given the recent proliferation of home computers, cell phone chargers and the like. ??They think baseline is set too low for many customers, and say families and people who work at home will pay more than their fair share of the rate hikes. ??""It's an anti-family action. People with kids have a hard time staying within baseline,"" said Mike Florio, senior attorney with The Utility Reform Network. ""A rate hike of 30 to 40 percent could be 100 percent for people with large households."" ??Since 1982, when lawmakers created baseline - given in cents per kilowatt hour per month - to ensure a minimum amount of affordable power and encourage conservation, the PUC has determined baseline by dividing the state into climatic and geographic regions. ??PG&E has 10 such regions within its service territory in northern and central California; Edison has six in central and southern California. ??The PUC then finds the average amount of electricity use for customers within each region. The baseline quantity is 50 percent to 60 percent of that amount, and up to 70 percent of that amount during the winter months if a customer uses only one type of energy (electricity or natural gas). ??Customers who depend on electronic medical equipment such as suction, breathing and dialysis machines, can apply for a slightly higher baseline. ??A family living in the scorching hot Coachella Valley would have a larger allotment of lower-priced electricity than a family living in breezy Monterey, given that air conditioning for the former is necessary to survival. ??Since baseline is based on averages, a single apartment dweller and a family of four who live in the same region could have the same baseline. That makes it more likely for the family to get hit with rate hikes and less likely, economists fear, that the apartment dweller has a financial incentive to conserve. ??""Where it is imperfect is that it has no ability to make any adjustments for the size of the family,"" said John Nelson, a PG&E spokesman. ??Focusing baseline on household size gets complicated, Florio said. ""Does PG&E come by and do bed checks?"" ??Along with raising $5.7 billion to replenish the state's general fund for power buys since January, the rate hikes approved March 27 by the PUC and allocated on Tuesday were also meant to trigger conservation that could help avoid rolling blackouts this summer. ??Baseline has not been reassessed since the early 1990s. PUC president Loretta Lynch and fellow commissioner Wood say they may hold hearings as early as this coming week on possible inequities and ways to update the system. ??""There was plenty of testimony at public hearings that people suspect that baselines are not appropriate or are not calculated right,"" Wood said. ??Wood said when baseline first was created nearly 20 years ago, houses were smaller and many lacked central air conditioning. ??Though the PUC has updated baseline amounts through the years, ""living standards have changed, housing standards have changed and it may be that average usage is different from what it was,"" Wood said. ??Florio said giving baselines a second look could go either way for consumers. There are typically more electronic gadgets in homes these days, but many of those gadgets and appliances are more energy efficient than their ancestors. ??Add that to increased conservation statewide, Florio said, and there's a slim chance baselines could actually go down and expose more customers to rate hikes. ??""It's a percentage of average use historically, and people have used energy more efficiently,"" through the years, Florio said. ??--- ??On the Net: ??California Public Utilities Commission: http://www.cpuc.ca.gov ??Pacific Gas and Electric Co.: http://www.pge.com ??Southern California Edison Co.: http://www.sce.com LOAD-DATE: May 22, 2001 of 85 DOCUMENTS ???????????????????The Associated Press State & Local Wire The materials in the AP file were compiled by The Associated Press. ?These materials may not be republished without the express written consent of The Associated Press. ????????????????????????May 21, 2001, Monday, BC cycle SECTION: State and Regional LENGTH: 273 words HEADLINE: New poll suggests Californians haven't been this gloomy for years DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO BODY: ??Not since the mid-'90s have more Californians believed the state is headed in the wrong direction. ??And it may get worse. ?Nearly 60 percent of state residents expect the economy to worsen in the next year, while about 40 percent see a brighter horizon, according to a new poll. ??The telephone survey of 2,001 adult Californians was done over eight days in early May by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California. The poll was conducted in English and Spanish. ??The twin culprits were the souring economy and the electricity crisis. ??""Californians clearly see the electricity crisis as a harbinger of other growth-related problems,"" said Mark Baldassare, the research institute's survey director. ""This crisis and general economic uncertainty have severely undermined public confidence in California's future and in its leaders."" ??Change has come swiftly. ??In January, 62 percent of state residents said California was headed in the right direction, compared to 48 percent this month. ??Other key findings include: ??-82 percent of respondents said population growth over the next 20 years will make California a less desirable place to live. ??-86 percent of respondents said the electricity crisis will hurt the state's economy. ??-43 percent of respondents favor building more power plants, up from 32 percent in January.

Headlines proclaimed a ""crisis,"" and legislative leaders shifted into an ""I told you so"" mode. ??Hold the phone. ??This is not California. There is no crisis. Customers with interruptible service contracts have always been subject to cutoffs in times of peak consumption or when generators are down. ??It may not be fair to suggest that Alliant Energy chose to idle three of its biggest generators to make the case for changing the law, but the timing is nonetheless convenient. The Legislature is set to convene a special session in a few weeks, and among the business left over from the regular session could be a bill to make it easier for power companies to build electric generating plants. ??While crisis is not imminent, Iowa does face the prospect of consuming more electricity than the state's utilities are able to generate themselves. ... ??While Iowa's law may need some ""streamlining,"" which could be dealt with in a special session, that should not be the end of the matter. Ultimately, the Legislature must fashion a long-range energy policy for this state that takes a regional view of energy, that reflects new market and regulation realities, and that seizes the potential for conservation and renewable alternatives to fossil fuels. ??Legislative session: ??TELEGRAPH HERALD ??Even after a marathon legislative session - this one lasted 121 days - why does it always seem the big-ticket items are pushed through in the final days? ??This year's session started out strong, passing a bill to save taxpayers money by eliminating the sales tax on residential utility bills. It finished up by coming through with $40 million for teachers' pay. ??But just what happened in those middle 100 or so days is a little murky. There was plenty of hand-wringing about the budget shortfall, the usual banter about dove hunting and a fair amount of partisan bickering. ... ??-Legislators didn't get around to a ... bill to close a loophole in Iowa's Open Records law. The way it stands now, a governmental body can use a private contractor to investigate problems within the department and keep that contractor's report confidential under the law's whistle-blower provision. ... ??-The Legislature didn't want to get into a full-blown gambling debate, so it didn't address a tax freeze at racetracks. ... The issue of fairness needs to be addressed. ??Floating casinos pay a 20 percent tax, while racetracks pay a gradually increasing tax that now stands at 30 percent. Under the law enacted in 1997, that tax will grow to 36 percent by 2004. ??-Other things that legislators talked about but didn't get around to include: cutting state income tax on Social Security income and a pair of bills addressing the state's bottle-deposit law. ??So the 2002 Legislature will have its work cut out for it. Here are some jobs for next year's to-do list: ??-Amend the Open Records Law. Allowing agencies to keep information about government activities secret simply because it is in the possession of an outside contractor is a hole in the law that needs to be fixed. ??-Carry the ball on increasing teachers' pay. The $40 million shot in the arm will have been a waste if the program is left hanging unfunded. ??-Freeze the amount of tax racetracks pay where it stands and stop the hemorrhaging of dollars into state coffers. The disparity between racetracks and riverboat casinos needs to be righted. ??And if they're worried that the discussion will draw an all-out gambling debate, lawmakers might want to bring it to the table before May. ??IOWA CITY PRESS-CITIZEN: ??We agree with Gov. Tom Vilsack that the new state budget approved by legislators ""will cause hardship for people and families across our state."" ??That's what happens when you face a $300 million revenue shortfall, and you don't have as much money as you wanted. ??But we disagree that ""for 3 1/2 months, they did very little."" ??On the contrary, Vilsack got what he said all along would be the high mark of this session - $40 million for teacher pay raises and a new system for teacher pay. ??And the Republican-led Legislature also agreed to phase out the sales tax on utilities, long a goal of Vilsack's Democratic Party. ??Are we happy with the budget? No. ??Is it the best we likely can do under the circumstances? Yes. ??Vilsack should sign budget legislation, rather than vetoing it and calling a special session of the Legislature this summer. ... ??Plant Sciences Institute: ??DES MOINES REGISTER: ??Iowa needs more people, especially young people. Iowa needs more jobs that pay well - the kinds of jobs that cause other businesses, small and large, to spring up here. So why did Iowa lawmakers blow the single best opportunity for both? ??They blame it on a tight budget. Blame them for failing to grasp the big picture. The fledgling Plant Sciences Institute at Iowa State University could become a major force in the fast-growing field of biotechnology related to agriculture - yet the 2001 Legislature provided no new money. ??It did continue the $4.67 million approved in 2000. It did not add $3 million, a meager increase proposed by the governor. It allowed ISU to keep money from the sale of land, with proceeds to be used for the institute's Roy J. Carver Co-Laboratory, to be completed by 2002. It should have added at least $10 million in cash. ... ??Because of legislative inaction, promising initiatives must slow down, or may never take place. ... ??The institute had hoped to hire another top researcher in the field of corn genomics ... ??Ag-biotech companies have been appealing to the state for help putting together a protein-extraction facility ... Such a facility might extract protein from conventional or genetically modified plants for such uses as pharmaceuticals, food additives or chemical enzymes for industrial processes. The Plant Sciences Institute has a small, pilot protein-extraction facility. New money from the Legislature would have allowed it to assist businesses in establishing a commercial facility. But now? ""The people interested in this will probably go elsewhere,"" said Director Stephen Howell. ??Why wouldn't they? Plenty of other states are serious about fostering biotech industries. The Iowa commitment is hardly encouraging. ... ??Iowa has a budget crunch because its economy and population are not growing fast enough. Investing in biotechnology - the technology that is expected to drive the next great wave of economic growth - is the most promising way to make Iowa's economy and population grow. Stinting on that investment is stunningly shortsighted. ??Ten million dollars next session should not be out of the question. The question should be what sort of future will Iowa have if it does not make the most of the potential the Plant Sciences Institute holds. ??Hunting requirements: ??AMES TRIBUNE: ??In April, the Iowa House and Senate rejected a measure that would have required wild turkey hunters to report their harvest to the Department of Natural Resources, saying it was ""just another hassle,"" for hunters. ??Then, the House hiked the fees for hunting licenses, in some cases up to 218 percent. A non-resident who wants to hunt deer in Iowa under this plan will have to shell out $308, including a hunting license and habitat fee. The current total is $156. ??Hassle? You got it. We might as well hang a sign on Iowa borders that says we don't much care about managing our wildlife and we don't want you here, either. Add to the mix a federal whammy in the Freedom to Farm Act, which has all but eliminated any fence rows, and hunting as a potential tourism draw to Iowa blows away in the wind. ... ??Instead of having accurate information on how much hunting is affecting turkey populations, Department of Natural Resources wildlife managers are now left to guess. ... ??Surrounding states which capitalize on their resources require even more harvest registration, and it hasn't slowed interest. ... ??The DNR asked for the fee increases for good reasons - license fees have not increased for a decade while the costs of salaries, travel and equipment have begun to eat into funds available for facilities and land acquisition. And we're in favor of using fees to support wildlife management. ??We also would allow that some of the increases do not seem to us to be egregious. A $3 fish habitat fee for instance, isn't a great deal to pay. Nor is a $30 tab for a non-resident 7-day fishing license out of line. ??But some fee hikes were too much. ??In particular, the non-resident fees for deer hunting are high especially in comparison to surrounding states, and are more than most ordinary people are likely to pay. Wisconsin charges non-residents $135 to hunt deer. Missouri charges $125. License fees in Iowa are likely to result in less money coming in, not more. What out-of-state hunter will be drawn to Iowa when surrounding states are managing their herds better and charging less to visit? ??Iowa worries that the farm economy is in the tank. We wring our hands as our young people rush to other parts of the country. We say that our natural resources here can be an attraction that will draw people back. Yet these votes run counter to sound wildlife management and increased tourism. ??Public official recruits: ??QUAD-CITY TIMES: ??More Iowa school districts and local governments are using professional companies to help find high-level administrators such as superintendents, but that recruiting tool is making the process less accountable to the public. ??In effect, it allows private firms to dictate public policy, and that's troubling. ??One example of this trend is the Camanche School District, where six finalists for the superintendents job were in town for interviews recently. They met with school board members, district staff and some residents, yet the board does not intend to reveal the names of the candidates. The Cedar Rapids headhunter firm that has contracted with the district advised the school board not to announce the names. ??Headhunters also are advising candidates to request their names be kept confidential. Under Iowa law, a public entity such as a school board must honor such a request. ??Some public officials justify this secrecy by arguing that finalists don't want the public to know if they didn't get the job offer or worry that identification may jeopardize their current position. ... ??Those arguments aren't justified, for reasons including: ??-There is nothing dishonorable in not being chosen for a top-level post. Indeed, being considered a finalist for such a job may serve only to enhance a candidates attractiveness for another position ... ??-Identifying the finalists for the public also allows citizens to ask questions and provide other information, critical or supportive, that could be useful in helping officials make a final choice. ??-And being upfront with the public lends credibility to the entire process ... ??We prefer a process similar to one used by the City of Clinton during its recent search for a city administrator. The five finalists were not only identified, they took part in an open house to meet the public. A headhunter firm was used, but City Attorney Bruce Johansen, himself a candidate who did not get the job, said he made it clear to the agency that the finalists names should be made public. ??We applaud that effort ... ??Meanwhile, the Iowa Legislature this spring modified a state law that has been the basis of confidentiality claims for candidates seeking public positions. The change would require that official communication between private contractors and the public entities they serve be open to public inspection. Whether that law will be interpreted to include headhunter firms remains to be seen. ... ??We encourage school boards and local governments to resist confidentiality and test the new law when it takes effect July 1. ??Train service: ??CEDAR RAPIDS GAZETTE: ??Who'd have thought that the selection of the secretary of the federal Department of Human Services last winter might affect whether Davenport, Iowa City and Des Moines get rail service. ??But consider that HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson, who resigned recently from the Amtrak board, had been a strong advocate of expanded rail service here in the Midwest while he was governor of Wisconsin. Thompson had hoped to remain chairman of the Amtrak board after he went to Washington. But the Associated Press reports that a 1997 law that restructured the Amtrak board says only one of the seven seats can be held by a member of the Cabinet - and the Bush administration wants Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta on the governing board. ??Few people around are as passionate as Thompson about Amtrak, and Iowa could have benefited. It's hard to ride a national passenger train service that doesn't go where the majority of Iowans live. Maybe the service will be expanded here. But maybe, with the changes in the governing board, that train has already left the station. ??Smoker identification: ??LE MARS DAILY SENTINAL: ??Have you heard the news from Walgreen's? They're going to card everybody who wants to buy a package of cigarettes, a box of cigars, a can of chew. ??Everybody. Not under 18. Not 27 and under. Everybody. ... ??That can't have been an easy decision. Within a year, they're looking at software that will require clerk's to enter a customer's birth date into a computer before a tobacco sale can be completed. Until then, they're asking their clerks to card everybody. Good for them. ... ??Yes, it will take a little extra time ... Evidently, the owners/corporate bigwigs think the time is well spent if it eliminates the fines and bad publicity. ??A convenience store association spokesman told reporters that other stores are likely to duplicate Walgreen's efforts. Yes. We certainly hope so. ??We all have heard terrible numbers of deaths caused by tobacco, of underage users ... Many, if not most of us, know someone who hacks and coughs, who died from smoking, who cries because someone died from smoking. When you think of them, it doesn't seem so outrageous to card everyone. It seems downright brilliant. ... ??It won't stop it entirely. Young wanna-be-smokers will have somebody older do the buying, or swipe a carton. There will always be a way to get around it, there always is. ??Still, carding everyone says, ""This is important, we mean it and we're not going to make it easy for you.""

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. MARK HAINES, CNBC ANCHOR, SQUAWK BOX: One company that is hurting a lot in all this is PG&E, the parent of Pacific Gas and Electric. They filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April. PG&E has about $9 billion in unrecovered power costs. A California bankruptcy judge says the company cannot raise retail rates to recoup those losses. The stock is on a steep decline this year, trading in the 52 week range of 6 to 32, last at about 11 1/2. Joining us to tell us where things are now and where they could be going, Robert Glynn, PG&E's Chairman and CEO. Mr. Glynn, good to see you again. ROBERT GLYNN, CHAIRMAN & CEO, PG&E: Good morning, Mark. HAINES: So where do we stand now? GLYNN: Well, we're working our way through the federal bankruptcy proceeding, where we affirmatively stepped in order to resolve issues between ourselves and our creditors. We have a plan of reorganization under development and we're getting close to the time when we can begin to share that plan with the creditors who, after all, need to get paid. HAINES: So let's first talk about time. How much time do you think this might take before PG&E emerges from bankruptcy? GLYNN: Well, it's very hard to tell for one reason. There have not been very many utility bankruptcies and I don't know of any that has had these complexities to it. The shortest possible time or shortest likely time that I've heard about has been six to eight months and that's probably shorter than it will take. The longest that I've heard about is about four years and that's an awful lot longer than I want it to take. HAINES: In the meantime you are selling electricity, transmitting and selling electricity on a retail level. Are you still losing money on your operating? GLYNN: Well, the potential area for continuing loss exposure is the issue of whether the California independent system operator is still buying on behalf of our company instead of buying directly on behalf of our customers. And that's an issue that's before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for decision making right now. HAINES: Well, I guess my question is who is paying the bills right now? GLYNN: Well, the electric rates in California have just been raised by the California Public Utilities Commission in order to have the state, the Department of Water Resources be able to recover all of its costs because that's what, of course, it wants to do. It doesn't want to go any deeper in debt than it has to. So this most recent large rate increase has applied, as best as we can tell, exclusively to cover the state's cost increases and not to cover some of the ones that we're responsible for. JOE BATTIPAGLIA: Mr. Glynn, the brownouts continue in California. What's the status of supply of electricity into the state, putting aside for a moment how you pay for it? GLYNN: Well, the California electricity crisis at its heart is a supply shortage and the outlook for this summer and next summer are pretty bleak. Every responsible entity that has reviewed the situation is forecasting that there will be a large number of rolling blackouts occurring over the summer of 2001 and probably 2002 as well, simply because there's not enough power to go around. BATTIPAGLIA: Does that spread from California to other states as the draw down becomes perilous? GLYNN: Well, the California electricity market and the Pacific Northwest markets have had a very nice symbiotic relationship over many, many years shipping power back and forth to one another. That has been interrupted because of the supply shortage in California, which means that California is trying to be a net importer all the time. And it seems like the Pacific Northwest won't have the kind of surplus energy to send south to California that it's had in the past. HAINES: Does this ultimately end with retail electricity distribution transmission and distribution being done by a state authority and no longer by privately held or publicly held companies? GLYNN: I don't think it ends there at all, Mark. And I certainly don't think that it's in the state's interest to try to get into businesses that can be done by private capital when the state has so many other important things to use its capital on, like education and infrastructure. And I do think that this supply shortage has got to be resolved. It's got to be resolved by building new supply. There's simply no alternative to that and that's going to take another couple of years before that new construction is fully completed. HAINES: All right, sir. Thank you very much for the update. We appreciate it. Robber Glynn, PG&E's Chairman and CEO.

DAVID ENSOR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Judy, Ambassador William Burns, the U.S. ambassador to Jordan, who is Mr. Powell's pick to be the next assistant secretary for the Middle East, has been asked to work with other recommendations for Mr. Powell and for President Bush on how the U.S. can best proceed from here, trying to use the recommendations of the Mitchell committee report to try to get the violence to de- escalate, to try to get the two sides talking instead of shooting at each other. ??Here is how Mr. Powell put it today. ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??POWELL: It is now up to the leaders in the region to show that they have heard this clarion call from this committee in a loud-and- clear way, and take actions that are available to them on both sides to let's have a cessation of hostilities, then we can begin the confidence-building measures and move toward negotiations. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??ENSOR: Now this report makes very specific recommendations and urges very specific actions by both sides: in both cases, quite difficult actions. ?First, it calls for the Palestinians and the Israelis to declare an immediate, unconditional cessation of violence. That's the first step, and that's the step that Secretary Powell repeatedly emphasized today must come first and must come right away or else nothing else will work. ??But the report goes on to make specific recommendations. ?For example, it urges that Israel put -- freeze all settlement development, all development of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories. ?It recommends that Israel resume paying the money that's collected in taxes back to the Palestinian Authority. ?It recommends a whole range of action, many of them to be taken by Israel, which the reports says would help bring the tone back to where it needs to be, would help bring the two sides back to where they could once again be negotiating instead of shooting at each other and letting off bombs. ??The -- the secretary, Secretary Powell, said that this is not the time, however, for him to get involved in shuttle diplomacy. ?He wants first to have Ambassador Burns and the others come up with recommendations over the next week, two weeks or three, and then he and the president will try to figure out where the U.S. can go from here. ??But clearly, this is -- clearly, this is a first step by an administration that until now has tried to keep its -- keep its powder a bit dry in the Middle East. ?They are now engaging somewhat, because they're so concerned about the situation out there, Judy. ??WOODRUFF: David, the report, the Mitchell report, suggesting that the Israelis more responsible here, or at least that they have more to do in order to get things back on the peace track than the Palestinians? ENSOR: The report is very even-handed. ?It doesn't blame either side for the situation. ?It, for example, does not blame Ariel Sharon's visit to the Temple Mount for the following Intifada, Intifada II it's been called. ?But it says that there needs to be a series of actions by both sides to bring down the tensions, and if you look at the list of what it's asking for, there are more steps that the Israelis would have to take than the Palestinians. ??WOODRUFF: And David, why is it that the administration is saying at this point that it is not prepared to get back in -- in a -- in a day-to-day way, in an energetically involved way the way the Clinton administration was? ??ENSOR: Well, I think the administration, this administration, feels that the Clinton people got -- got to the point where they were micromanaging the thing a little bit. ?It was too much presidential involvement and it was too much of a day-to-day hand-holding operation. ?They feel they need to hold back a little bit and try to get the parties to talk to each other. ??However, the situation is deteriorating pretty rapidly, and so now they realize they have to have some greater involvement. ?And that's why Ambassador Burns has been asked to prepare these recommendation, Judy. ??WOODRUFF: All right. ?David Ensor reporting for us from the State Department. ??For more on the Middle East conflict, stay with us for a special half-hour report. ?That's beginning at 6:00 p.m. Eastern. ??Now, we turn to questions about the Bush administration's political fund-raising tactics. ?Tonight, Vice President Dick Cheney is scheduled to host some 400 big GOP donors at his official residence in Washington. ?A spokeswoman for the Democrats says that that event smacks of, in her words, hypocrisy. ??The Democrats say the reception at the vice president's home is comparable to Clinton-era events, such as White House coffees and Lincoln Bedroom sleepovers for big donors, which drew heavy criticism from Republicans. ?Among them: presidential candidate George W. Bush. ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??BUSH: I believe they've moved that sign, ""The buck stops here,"" from the Oval Office desk to the buck stops here on the Lincoln Bedroom. ?And that's not good for the country, it's not right. ?We need to have a new look about how we conduct ourselves in office. There's a huge trust. ?I see it all the time when people come up to me and say, ""I don't want you to let me down again."" ??And we can do better than the past administration has done. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??WOODRUFF: Despite that sort of criticism then, the Republicans are defending their fund-raising tactics now. ?Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott had this to say about the reception for big donors at Vice President Cheney's home tonight. ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??SEN. TRENT LOTT (R-MS), MAJORITY LEADER: I'm sure it's being done in an inappropriate way, or Dick Cheney wouldn't -- wouldn't be doing it. ?So if there's any question, I'd suggest you address it to them. ?Unfortunately, I think that most of us will not be able to be there. ?We're going to be here voting, giving tax relief. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??WOODRUFF: Virtually all of those GOP contributors, who will mingle with Vice President Cheney at his home tonight, have given at least $100,000 to the Republican National Committee. ?They will also attend a major RNC fund-raiser tomorrow night that features President Bush as the main speaker and is expected to net some $15 million in soft money. ??Now let's bring in our White House correspondent, Major Garrett. ??Major, tell us about what this event is about tomorrow night. ??MAJOR GARRETT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's the first official Republican National Committee event to honor the president and the first lady, as you said. The targeted haul is $15 million. Republican National Committee officials tell CNN that it's about 70 percent of that 15 million will be soft money. ?About 30 percent will be hard dollars -- that is dollars that are regulated under the existing campaign finance scheme -- and that it is a big event, one that the Republican Party has held for years and years in Washington. ??As for what's happening in the vice president's residence tonight, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer told me this is a way of saying ""Thank you,"" in his words, ""to those Republicans who,"" as Ari Fleischer said, ""did so much to help win the selection."" ??And he draws a distinction with the Clinton-era coffees and sleepovers, describing them as, quote, ""organized schemes to bring people through the gates of the White House to get money or to persuade others to do so."" ??Mark Minor, who is the communications director for the Republican National Committee, also said that no one paid to go to the vice president's residence. No checks will pass between hands there. There is no quid pro quo, and that some people who will be at the vice president's residence tonight are not in fact RNC donors -- Judy. ??WOODRUFF: So, Major, again, clarify the distinction between money events that are given as a thank you and events that are given as an encouragement to give more money. ??GARRETT: Well, it's a distinction this White House wants to draw as clearly as it possibly can. ?In the words of Ari Fleischer, thanking someone, whether it's on government property or not on government property, is a completely legitimate activity for the president or the vice president to engage in. ?The distinction he is drawing is that during the Clinton era people were brought to the White House, to these coffees, and as was disclosed in the Thompson report that was conducted by the Senate investigating that, there was some evidence of actually targeted lists: that people who were brought in, money was described to bringing in for a coffee. ?A certain dollar amount was attached to donations to the Democratic National Committee, a larger amount if they, in fact, slept here at the White House in the Lincoln Bedroom. ?That is the key distinction, the Republicans say: that there is no targeting necessarily of these people to come to the vice president's residence. ??They also point out that the original letters inviting these big donors to Washington did not in any way suggest there would be a reception at the vice president's residence: the point there being these people donated without any expectation of having dinner or reception with Lynne Cheney and Dick Cheney in the vice president's home. ??WOODRUFF: And Major, just to clarify, the 400 people invited tonight to the vice president's, how many are they saying did not give money? ??GARRETT: They're not disclosing any numbers. ?They're only saying that some have given. ?They clearly and readily acknowledge that. ?Some are lobbyists. Some represent large corporations. ?But others, they say, are just Republican National Committee officials. And others of an undisclosed nature -- not fund-raisers, not Republican Party officials -- who will be there tonight. Don't have any numbers for you on that, though. ??WOODRUFF: All right, Major Garrett reporting at the White House. Thank you very much. ??Vice President Cheney maybe taking some heat for fund-raising tactics, not to mention his role in creating the Bush energy plan. Look that this: ??Our new poll shows Cheney's job approval rating is 4 points higher than the presidents. ?While Mr. Bush's approval rating has held pretty steady in the past couple of weeks, he has lost ground since late April. ?Cheney's approval rating has dipped as well. ??For more on Mr. Bush's ratings and how they relate to his policies, we are joined now by our senior political analyst Bill Schneider. ??Tell us, Bill, which of Mr. Bush's policies is the most popular? ??WILLIAM SCHNEIDER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, you might guess energy, given the high ratings for Dick Cheney that you just reported -- but you would be wrong. ??Because, what Americans like best is the tax cut. ?Two thirds of the public now favors a substantial tax cut. ?That's up from 60 percent earlier this month. Well, why not? ?What's wrong with getting some money back from the government? ??Actually, most people do not think the tax cut could benefit them much financially. ?They like it because they believe it will help the economy. ?And that is why so many Democrats find it very difficult to oppose. ??WOODRUFF: What about the energy plan? ??SCHNEIDER: Not such a success. ?Not like the tax cut. ?Americans are actually divided over the president's energy plan. ?Why? ?It's not because the public blames the Bush administration for the nation's energy problems. ?Most people blame the oil companies. ??In fact, more people blame Congress and the Clinton administration and environmental laws and American consumers than blame the Bush administration. But most Americans still give President Bush low marks on energy. ?The core criticism of his energy plan is: it doesn't do enough. ?55 percent of Americans say President Bush is not doing enough to solve the country's energy problems. ??What doesn't the plan do? ?It doesn't do much right now. ?Only 8 percent of Americans believe the plan will help the nation's energy problem immediately. Most people think oh, it will help, but only after several years. ?It's a long-run solution. ?Americans want help now. ?Right now. ?With electricity in California. ?And with gas prices all over the country. ?Long-term solutions are important, but politics is a short-term business. ?If the problem is now, people want results now. ??And they don't see what the Bush energy plan is going to do about $2-a-gallon gasoline now. ??WOODRUFF: Why do people think the energy plan fails to do that? ??SCHNEIDER: Because they think this administration is run by oilmen. ?Oilmen like $2-a-gallon gasoline. ?Maybe even 3. ??By nearly two to one, the public believes energy companies have too much influence over the Bush administration's policies. ?In fact, Americans are split when you ask them whether the Bush energy plan is designed to further the country's interests or the energy companies' interests. ?That sounds like breathtaking cynicism. ?But any administration that's run by Texas oilmen is automatically suspect. ??WOODRUFF: All right, Bill Schneider, thank you very much. You're not suspect. ??SCHNEIDER: I am certainly not. ??WOODRUFF: At least as far as we know. ??Do Californians blame President Bush for their energy crisis? We've heard a little bit from Bill on that. ?That answer and more on the issue later this hour. ?Plus: ??Just what kind of tax cut is the Senate considering? ?Jonathan Karl crunches the numbers. ?Also: ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have no ability to bring up the amendments. ?You don't set the agenda every day, and that is real power in the House. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??WOODRUFF: The trials and tribulations of the minority leader, as he considers the present and the future. ?And later: ??Rewarding a president's most controversial decision. ?A political ""Profile In Courage."" All ahead on INSIDE POLITICS. ??(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ??WOODRUFF: President Bush today donned the traditional commencement robes, and gave the graduating class at Yale University a few bits of advice. ?The president also included a glimpse at his less-than-perfect college years. ?As CNN's Kelly Wallace reports, today's speech was a departure from how the President's dealt with his alma mater in the past. ??(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ??KELLY WALLACE, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A homecoming of sorts, George W. Bush who has only been back to his alma mater once since graduating in 1968, returns to address those at the top and the bottom of Yale's graduating class. ??BUSH: And to the C students... ??(LAUGHTER) ??I say, you too, can be president of the United States. ??(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) ??WALLACE: The president offering a self-deprecating account of his days as the undergraduate, when, as a history major, he earned modest grades and was known more as a fraternity boy prankster than a rising political star. ??The visit was not without controversy, with some students protesting and some professors boycotting, charging that Mr. Bush was not yet deserving of an honorary degree. ??PETER BROOKS, YALE UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR: It doesn't seem at present to represent the intellectual ideals and the service to humanity in which we think that Yale stands for. ??WALLACE: The president has kept his distance from this Ivy League institution for most of his political life, painting it as a symbol of elitism, even during his days at Yale. TERRY JOHNSON, BUSH'S YALE ROOMMATE: What George -- does not respond well to are people who are snobs, whether you are a social snob or an intellectual snob or any other kind of snob. ??WALLACE: Mr. Bush rarely mentions what he did on this day, that he was born in New Haven when his dad, the former president, was an undergraduate at Yale. ??BUSH: My life began just a few blocks from here, but I was raised in West Texas. ?From there, Yale always seemed a world away. ??WALLACE: The president, for years, had been miffed with Yale for not awarding an honorary degree to his dad until 1991, the third year of his presidency. ?But it appears now, all is forgiven. ??BUSH: In my time they spoke of the Yale man, I was really never sure of what that was. ?But I do think that I am a better man because of Yale. ??WALLACE: Mr. Bush, the son and grandson of Yalies and now father of a current student, seems very proud that Yale is a part of his past. ??Kelly Wallace, CNN, New Haven, Connecticut. ??(END VIDEOTAPE) ??WOODRUFF: And looking now ahead to 2004: the Reverend Al Sharpton says that he will explore seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. ?The civil rights activist said yesterday that the party did not protect the rights of disenfranchised voters in Florida in the last presidential race. ??If he runs, Sharpton said that he would promote issues that concern blacks and progressives, and his effort would not be just symbolic. ?Sharpton ran unsuccessfully for the Senate in New York in 1994 and for mayor of New York City in 1997. ??Reverend Sharpton and former Republican presidential candidate Gary Bauer will discuss President Bush's faith-based plan to help the poor tonight on ""CROSSFIRE."" That's at 7:30 p.m. Eastern. ??Another note from New York: a state supreme court justice today barred Rudy Giuliani's girlfriend from the mayor's official residence, Gracie Mansion. ?The judge ruled in favor of Giuliani's estranged wife, Donna Hanover, who had requested a restraining order barring Judith Nathan from the residence. ?The ruling says that Nathan may not enter the residence as long as the Giuliani children continue to live there. ?The judge also denied Giuliani's second attempt for a gag order in the couple's divorce proceedings. ??And we'll have the latest on President Bush's tax cut when we come back. ??(COMMERCIAL BREAK) WOODRUFF: This evening, the Senate is expected to vote on the latest version of the now $1.35 trillion tax cut plan. ?Republican leaders hope to give President Bush the tax cut for approval before Memorial Day. ?But as Jonathan Karl reports, taxpayers will have a longer wait before reaping any of the measure's benefits. ??(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ??JONATHAN KARL, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Senate's $1.35 trillion tax cut would be the biggest in a generation, but don't spend your tax windfall yet. ?Most of the cuts will not take effect for several years to come. ??Relief from the so-called major penalty will not start until the year 2005. The estate tax won't be repealed until 2011. ?That means even if President Bush is re-elected, it wouldn't take effect until two years after he completed his second term. ?The IRA contribution limit would be raised from $2,000 to $5,000, but that also wouldn't happen until the year 2011. ??The tax cut calls for doubling of the child tax credit, but that takes 10 years too. ?The credit would rise from $500 to $600 this year, slowly increasing in $100 increments over the next 10 years until it finally reaches $1,000 in the year 2011. ?The cuts in income tax rates would be phased in even more slowly. ??SEN. CHARLES GRASSLEY (R-IA), FINANCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: You are right, some of them do not -- are phased in over a period of time. But there is real relief in this tax bill for every taxpayer starting January 1, 2001. ?They don't have to wait until next year. ??KARL: That immediate tax relief amounts to $300 for individuals and $600 for couples filing jointly, but just how that money gets back to taxpayers is still to be worked out. ?The option favored by the president is a simple rebate check sent directly to taxpayers, an idea opposed by many Senate Republicans who call it impractical. ??But the rebate would represent a fraction of the overall tax cut, which Democratic opponents say will explode in cost after it's fully phased in two years from now. ??SEN. KENT CONRAD (D), NORTH DAKOTA: This plan is fully back- loaded. ?That means simply that it is disguised in terms of its full cost. ?This decade it cost $1.35 trillion. ?In the next decade, it will cost from 3.5 to $4 trillion. ??KARL: But there's a little noticed provision of this tax cut that may make that point moot. ?The tax cut includes a sunset provision, that means all the tax cuts in the bill would expire in the year 2012. ?For the tax cuts to remain in place, Congress would have to pass them again. ??(END VIDEOTAPE) ??KARL: Now, the Senate is expected to vote on a series of amendments to the tax cut later on today, paving the way for a final vote on the tax cut here in the Senate tonight. ?But it will not end there. ?This still needs to be reconciled with the tax cut that was passed in House, the House passing almost exactly the president's tax cut, including much deeper cuts in income tax rates preferred by Republicans. ??The Senate and the House will have to work out their differences. They're expected to do so this week, setting the stage to send this final tax cut down Pennsylvania Avenue and onto the president's desk by Memorial Day -- Judy. ??WOODRUFF: Jon, when you talk about the plan providing 300 or $300 a year per individual, divided by 12, that's $20-some a month. Is this the kind of money the president was talking about when he said the tax cut would help people with higher gasoline prices? ??KARL: This was exactly what he had it mind. ?This was exactly what he was talking about, directing the money right into the hands of taxpayers, directly into the hands of those people paying higher gasoline prices at the pumps. ??This is an idea that his Treasury secretary, Paul O'Neill, strongly favors, the idea of direct cash payments or check payments to taxpayers. ?But one big problem with this, Judy, is that taxpayers over the course of time move, they change addresses, some of them die. The question is, how do you make sure you get all the right checks to those people at current addresses? ?It's not an easy proposition. ??WOODRUFF: And Jon, one other subject, we know the president's nominee to be solicitor general of the United States has run into a real problem in the Senate committee. ?Where does that stand right now? ?The last we heard, the Senate Judiciary had split 9-9 on the nomination of Ted Olson. ??KARL: Well, the Senate leaders, Trent Lott and Tom Daschle, are now actively involved in this, trying to come to some kind of an agreement, an agreement that will allow the Democrats to get access to some information they want about Olson, especially information that was compiled by independent council Robert Ray, looking to just what Olson's involvement was in that Arkansas Project by the ""American Spectator"" magazine, the investigation into Bill Clinton's personal life. ??They want information from the independent council to look at just how involved Olson was in that project, to see whether or not he was truthful in his testimony when he said he was not very involved at all. ?There's some movement to try to get the Democrats on the committee more of the information, also maybe to release more of it to the public. ??If that's all done, it would set the stage for a vote on the Olson nomination before the full Senate, but probably not until after Memorial Day. ?The Senate goes on recess at the end of the week, they will be off all of next week, you probably won't see a vote on the Olson nomination until after they return. ??WOODRUFF: All right, Jon Karl at the Capitol, thanks. In the House of Representatives, Democrats are finding themselves drowned out by the Republican majority. ?Add to that, critics who say the party is lacking leadership and strategy. ?And life in the House minority begins to look bleak. ?Our Kate Snow caught up with the House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt to talk about the balance of power and his political future. ??(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ??REP. DICK GEPHARDT (D-MO), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: We need to say what are we for, and that's what... ??KATE SNOW, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Dick Gephardt will tell you it's frustrating being a Democrat these days, stuck in the minority without the backing of the White House. ??GEPHARDT: Well, you take what you -- what you are given. ?I mean, the people run this country. ?We don't. ?And so, you fight for what you believe in as hard as you can, and if you really believe in it, then you're frustrated if you're not able to those policies through. ??SNOW: Gephardt says the Democrats are forced to play defense, responding to Republicans. ??GEPHARDT: I think we slowed down a little bit the amount of the tax bill -- not enough, in my view -- but we lowered it some so that the potential deficits out there in the future won't be so large. ?I think we cooperated with the president on the educational bill, at least the substance of it, but we still haven't been able to convince him or the Republicans to put enough money into education to really make the program happen. ??On energy, I think that we've got a very, very positive alternative that I hope people will listen to. ?People in California and Oregon and Washington need help now. ??SNOW: That was last week's theme. ?First at a gas station, the lawn of the Capitol the next day, and then in a underground war room. ??Gephardt is a master at staying on message, often spending hours talking to the press, his strategy: agree with Republicans when he thinks they're right and hammer at home when he disagrees. ??GEPHARDT: If we do not learn from history, we are forced to repeat it. ?This is a mistake that we will pay for for years to come. ??I try not to yell. ?I try to get ideas across as good a way as I can. ?But there are times when you need to show your emotion. ?You need to let people know that you really care about this. ?And you really want the country to go in a different direction. ?And I think you can't appear too tentative or too laid back or too uninterested. ??SNOW: But is the strategy working? ??I have talked to some Democrats who say that they are truly unhappy. Some of whom say that they are unhappy with your leadership. ?They don't feel that you're doing an effective job. ?Do you feel that there is trouble within the ranks? ??GEPHARDT: I don't. ?I think that -- I think the ranks and the Democratic Party are largely unified. ?They are marching together and working together in ways that I've never seen them before. ?I always tell them that it's me and we. And we have to be a team. ??I would never tell you that anybody is ever going to be pleased every day with everything that happens, but largely, I think that we've achieved real unity and real effectiveness in being the loyal opposition here in Washington. ??SNOW: How much of your days are spent thinking about 2002 in the next election? ??GEPHARDT: Well, I want to win the majority back. ?I think it's really important, not for the party and not for me, but for the country. ??SNOW: Is it more important to win back the majority than it is to win legislatively for the next couple of years? ??GEPHARDT: I think it is in the House for sure, because the minority is really out of power totally in the House. ?You have no ability to bring up amendments, you don't set the agenda every day. And that is real power in the House. ??SNOW: There is a lot of focus on 2004, a lot of talk about your ambitions, do you have plans to run for president? ??GEPHARDT: I really think that if you don't stay totally focused on the goal that is ahead of you, then you lessen your chances of reaching that goal. ?And my goal is to win back the majority in the Congress in 2002. ?I think, as usual in our system, we all want to look ahead and start calling the next race after that for president, but that is not what I'm doing and not what I should be doing. ??SNOW (voice-over): Gephardt insists he's not planning ahead, though he's scheduled to attend four events in New Hampshire in two weeks. ??GEPHARDT: The future will take of itself. ?I have no idea what will happen, and I'm not worried about it, and I don't spend time worrying about it. Because, again, I've got to do this in 2002. ?This is what we're trying to do. ??SNOW: So, are you committed to staying minority leader through 2002? ??GEPHARDT: Absolutely. ?I'm totally committed to winning this House back, and I think we are going to do it. ??SNOW: Speaker of the House, you said to me last fall that that had a nice ring to it? GEPHARDT: It works for me. ??(END VIDEOTAPE) ??WOODRUFF: Kate Snow talking with House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt. ?They talked today. ?And later this week, Kate will sit down with House Speaker Dennis Hastert. ?You can look for that report on Friday. ??On another term for the another high-profile Republican and two nationally known Democrats with apparent home state ambitions. ??INSIDE POLITICS will be right back. ??(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ??To no one's surprise, Charlton Heston was reelected today to an unprecedented fourth term as president of the National Rifle Association. ?The 77-year-old actor was chosen at the NRA's annual convention in Kansas City. ?The group changed its rules last year to allow Heston a third term, and a spokesman said there really wasn't much discussion by the board before deciding to elect him, once again. ??Former Attorney General Janet Reno may be looking for a new line of work. Now back in her native Florida, Reno says she finds the idea of running for governor appealing. ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??JANET RENO, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL: I love Florida very much. I was born and raised there. ?I have lived there most of my life. ?And I want to make sure that I do everything I can, either as governor or otherwise, to serve the interest of the people of Florida. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??WOODRUFF: Reno says she does not believe that her Parkinson's Disease would keep her from running, and she expects to make a decision before the end of the year. ??Governor Jeb Bush says possible opponents do not factor into his decision on whether to run for reelection. ??House Minority Whip David Bonior may trade in his Congressional seat for a run at the governor's mansion. ?The 13-term Congressman from Michigan filed his paperwork today to become a candidate in Michigan's 2002 governor's race. ?His aides say that a formal announcement will come later. ?With Michigan slated to lose one House district, Bonior's seat may be vulnerable to the state's Republican controlled redistricting efforts. ?Republican Governor John Engler cannot seek reelection because of term limits. ??Californians and the energy crunch: are they pointing fingers at the president? ?We'll check new poll numbers from the Golden State, and discuss power politics in the state when we return. ??(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ??WOODRUFF: At ground zero on the energy crunch: more than half of Californians say they disapprove of the way President Bush is handling that state's power woes, according to a new poll. ?But the survey shows more Californians are placing blame for the problem on utility companies, former Governor Pete Wilson and current Governor Gray Davis than on President Bush and the federal government. ?The Democrats are trying hard to convince Californians that Republicans should be held accountable for the power problem. ?Here is a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ad that begins airing in Los Angeles today. ??(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ??NARRATOR: California's energy crisis is deepening, with summer blackouts predicted and rate hikes of up to 80 percent. Yet President Bush has offered no relief to hard-pressed rate payers. ?His spokesman saying, ""The president continues to believe that the issue is mostly a California matter"" and our representative, Stephen Horn, has joined with Bush in opposing a temporary cap on electricity prices. ?Call Congressman Horn and tell him we need action now. ??That is if you can find the phone. ??(END VIDEO CLIP) ??WOODRUFF: The Democratic committee said that it has bought significant air time for that spot, part of a month-long radio and TV ad campaign targeting Republicans on energy. ?Let's talk more now about energy politics with the director of that Public Policy Institute of California poll we just told you about, Mark Baldassare joins us now from San Francisco. ??Mark, first of all, this poll finds Californians pessimistic in general, did that surprise you? ??MARK BALDASSARE, CALIFORNIA POLLSTER: It did. ?For the past three years, we've been in an incredible time of optimism in California. ?Two-thirds of Californians have said that the state is going in the right direction. ?Most Californians felt that economic times would continue to be good, and most Californians also were highly approving of the governor and the legislature. For the first time, we've seen a dramatic drop in optimism about the state, about the economy and ratings of the governor. ??WOODRUFF: And why do you think that is? ??BALDASSARE: Well, eight in ten Californians say they have been closely following the electricity situation in the state and most Californians are telling us in our survey that they consider it the top issue and 80 percent of Californians say it's a big problem and moreover, a problem that is going to effect the economy. ?So there's been a great deal of uncertainty that's been created by the electricity situation and because of that uncertainty, people are beginning to feel very nervous about our state. ??WOODRUFF: So you're saying because of the electricity crisis, if you want to call it that in California, it's now driving people's views of everything: population, the economy, across-the-board. ??BALDASSARE: We -- for the past few years people have been focused on improving the schools, for instance. ?Now only 6 percent in our most recent survey said that's the issue that concerns them most in the state. ?And we see that there is growing pessimism at the same time that there is growing concern that this electricity situation is not under control and could affect the state's economy. ??WOODRUFF: Explain for us, Mark, who people are blaming. ?We were -- Bill Schneider reported earlier on the program that Americans, overall, are having mixed views about to what extent President Bush is responsible. ?Here we're learning in California, they hold President Bush far less responsible than they do local leaders. ??BALDASSARE: Yeah, well, we are at time right now in California where people haven't experienced the rate hikes yet. ?They've certainly heard about them. They haven't experienced, for the most part, frequent rolling blackouts, but they hear that they're coming. And so when we talk about blame, people are focused on what happened five years ago to put us into this situation. ?And for that, of course, they don't blame either the current governor or the current president. ?Now, as we go forward over the next few months, people are going to be re-assigning blame as well as re-evaluating the solutions that are in place, and that's why I think both the Democrats and Republicans are very urgently trying to get their message out right now about who they think is to blame and who they think has the best solutions. ??WOODRUFF: Well, Mark, what is your reading on this? ?Are ads, like the ones we just saw the Democrats running out there, are those likely to have an effect on people's views? ??BALDASSARE: I don't think so. ?I think that what is will most going to have a effect on people's views over these next few months is how the crisis is actually resolved. ?And if people feel that these electricity hikes have really, you know, altered their lifestyle or they're going to impact the economy, if they feel blackouts are really going to, you know, put them in an uncomfortable situation going through the summer, then my guess is they are going to give blame both to Bush and to Davis. ??WOODRUFF: All right, Mark Baldassare of the California Public Policy Institute. ?Thanks very much, good to see you again. ??BALDASSARE: Thank you. ?Same here. ??WOODRUFF: As California tries to ease its energy problems, there are concerns about the cost not only for consumers, but for the environment. ?CNN's Rusty Dornin takes a closer look at the issues being raised by one California plant's effort to expand. ??(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ??RUSTY DORNIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): An aging giant known as the Mighty Moss. ?The 50-year-old Moss Landing Natural Gas plant along California's coast owned by Duke Energy. ?A face lift and an expansion will soon make this the largest power generator in the state, providing 2.3 million homes with light, heat and air conditioning. ?But all that power takes water to cool the turbines, water that's home to otters, fish, herons and other wildlife. ??CAROLYN NIELSEN, PLANT OPPONENT: Every day, Duke will use 333 football-size fields -- pools of water that are 10 feet deep. ?That is just incomprehensible. ??DORNIN: Water from the wetlands run through the plant, returning to the ocean 30 degrees warmer. ?Been that way for 50 years. ?Now environmentalists worry that increasing the intake will sterilize any creature sucked in. ??PATRICIA MATEJCEK, SIERRA CLUB: Everything that lives in that volume of water: eggs from fish from clams, diatoms, young fish, everything in it will be killed. ??DORNIN: Environmentalists say the Mighty Moss got a break on the approval process, as regulators here faced the state's energy crisis. It took 14 months. Permitting for smaller plants in the state is down to 21 days. ??KAITILIN GAFFNEY, CENTER FOR MARINE CONSERVATION: It's so fast that my concern is that we wouldn't even catch really obvious problems because we are just are not taking a hard look at these plants at all. ??DORNIN: But here's the twist as part of the permit process: local environmental groups signed off on the Mighty Moss renovation plan. ??GAFFNEY: So at the eleventh hour, we were able to work out this deal with Duke to at least ensure that the scientific monitoring will go on. ??DORNIN (on camera): Duke Energy will spend more than $8 million expanding the wetlands and in donations to local environmental groups. There will also be an independent monitor who will assess any damage to the environment. ??TOM WILLIAMS, DUKE ENERGY: This will more than compensate any potential effects that the new power plant will have on the habitat. This state is in an energy crisis. ?The new plant we're bringing on is cleaner, more efficient than virtually any plant in the country today. ??DORNIN: Environmentalists made a deal here, but many fear, in a power-hungry state, taking what they can get may be their only option. ??Rusty Dornin, CNN, Moss Landing, California. ??(END VIDEOTAPE) ??WOODRUFF: A very different kind of power politics, circa the 1970s, is being seen in a whole new light in some circles. ?Former President Ford is honored for granting a famous -- some would say infamous -- at pardon. ??That's next on INSIDE POLITICS. ??(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ??WOODRUFF: It is something that many Americans that lived through the Watergate era might never dream they would see. ?An award named for a Democratic icon presented to the man who angered many Democrats by pardoning Richard Nixon. ??CNN's Bruce Morton has an inside view of this twist on political history. ??(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ??CAROLINE KENNEDY SCHLOSSBERG, JOHN KENNEDY'S DAUGHTER: He placed his love of country ahead of his own political future. ?We are honored to present you, President Ford, with the John F. Kennedy Profile In Courage Award for 2001. ??(APPLAUSE) ??BRUCE MORTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Gerald Ford, now 87, got the award because, as a new unelected president, he pardoned his predecessor, Richard Nixon, who had resigned in disgrace to avoid impeachment over the Watergate scandal. ??RICHARD M. NIXON, 37TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow. ??MORTON: ""Our long national nightmare is over,"" the new man said of Watergate. But really, what would end it? ?Nixon could still face charges. ??GERALD FORD, 38TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: My conscience tells me that only I, as president, have the constitutional power to firmly shut and seal this book. ??MORTON: And so he granted: ??FORD: A full, free and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon. ??MORTON: Many Americans thought that was a mistake. ??SEN. TED KENNEDY (D), MASSACHUSETTS: I was one of those who spoke out against his actions then, but time has a way of clarifying past events. ?And now we see that President Ford was right. ??MORTON: Not everyone agrees. ?Ford's press secretary at the time, Gerald Ter Horst, resigned to protest the Nixon pardon and still thinks it was wrong. ??JERRY TER HORST, FORMER FORD PRESS SECRETARY: He was going to go off scot-free, whereas all of his minions -- the people who worked at the White House, from the chief of staff on down to Ehrlichman, Chuck Colson and others -- they were going to have to do prison time; they were not going to get pardons. MORTON: And it may have cost Ford the 1976 election. ?It was a close election. Many things could have swung it, but the pardon was surely one. ?Jimmy Carter, who beat Ford, thanked him Inauguration Day. ??JAMES EARL CARTER, 39TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: For myself and for our nation, I want to thank my predecessor for all he has done to heal our land. ??MORTON: Accepting the award, Ford talked about the need for courage today in a politics dominated by ""partisan jockeying at the expense of public policy."" ??FORD: I sense a longing for community, a desire on the part of Americans to be part of something bigger, finer than themselves. ??MORTON: Historians may still argue about the pardon. ?They agree he cared about his country and its politics, and did what he thought was right. ??Bruce Morton, CNN, Washington. ??(END VIDEOTAPE) ??WOODRUFF: Also cited for political courage today, Democratic Congressman John Lewis of Georgia who was beaten, as he and others challenged segregation during the freedom rides through the South in 1961. ??Lewis was given a special Profile of Courage Award for Lifetime Achievement. ??Former president Ford, Congressman Lewis and Caroline Kennedy will all be guests tonight on ""WOLF BLITZER REPORTS.""

The Brattle Group is a consulting firm that Edison has long used to beat up on SoCalGas (recall that Edison used to be a big gas customer when it owned power plants). Edison ""arranged"" for the Brattle Group to be the star witness at the Cal Leg gas hearing. Their job was to set up El Paso and Dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day. Their message was simple (and simplistic): El Paso and Dynegy have market power. They have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas at the border (to ""obscene"" levels). That, in turn, has driven up electricity prices. Ken Lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow, and Rob Bradley asked that I provide the alternative view to the Edison/Brattle rant, in the event that he gets any questions on the topic. It's attached. Apologies, it's quick and dirty, but it provides the basics. Obviously no need for us to defend El Paso or Dynegy, but might be useful to offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the California Legislature is peddling. Finally, we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing (the California PUC FERC lawyer claimed that ENA and TW colluded to drive up basis when ENA controlled a portion of the capacity), but the overriding goal of the hearing was to go after EP and Dynegy. Best, Jeff

Subject:: Time Magazine - Enron Plays the Pipes....
Body:: this is fantastic!! ---------------------- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/NA/Enron on 08/22/2000 04:57 PM --------------------------- From: Ann M Schmidt 08/22/2000 09:03 AM To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron, Mark Koenig/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Paula Rieker/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Mark Palmer/Corp/Enron@ENRON Subject: Time Magazine - Enron Plays the Pipes.... This article is forwarded to you per Mark Palmer's request... Business Enron Plays The Pipes This old-time gas company is trading fuel for a future as a new-economy superpower. Will the swap work? Frank Gibney Jr./Houston 08/28/2000 Time Magazine Time Inc. 38+ (Copyright 2000) It's Saturday night, and the only thing between you and a movie from Blockbuster Video is the unpaid late fee for last week's rental. If that sounds familiar, then you'll appreciate this: next year Blockbuster plans to offer up to 500 movie titles online in more than a dozen major cities around the U.S. That's right, video on demand (not the frustrating no-rewind, no-pause pay-per-view offerings of today) for anyone with a DSL line at home. What's remarkable is that Blockbuster's partner happens to be an energy company called Enron. At a time when so many old-economy companies seem helpless against the dizzying pace and technology of the digital age, Enron is demonstrating why FORTUNE magazine keeps voting it the most innovative large company in America. For years the Houston-based firm simply produced, transported and marketed natural gas. Then, as energy deregulation threatened profit margins in the gas business, Enron discovered it could make billions by trading and brokering packages of energy the way Midwesterners do pork bellies. Now Enron is moving into the telecommunications business, with a national fiber-optic cable network and a floor bulging with Sun supercomputers. In fact, Enron may be the most interesting old-economy company around. Since moving its trading operations from the phone to the Web eight months ago, the company has doubled revenues to more than $30 billion. Most of that is made through trading everything from energy and paper to weather risk derivatives and now bandwidth--more than 800 offerings in all. Think of eBay, but instead of auctioning $5 used Baby Gap pajamas, the company trades $600,000 blocks of natural gas--and pockets commensurately huge commissions. Boasts Enron president Jeffrey Skilling: ""In terms of dollars transacted, we're the world's largest online site by a factor of 10."" So far this year, that has meant $120 billion in transactions. And when you're running the network, all sorts of profitable opportunities arise. Last week, when word spread that natural-gas prices would spike this winter, Enron's in-house traders saw their gains surge as customers raced to lock in future supplies at today's prices. And Enron's stock price? It hit $90 last week, tripling its value of a year ago. Kind of like an Internet play, only better. The market loves Enron because Skilling and CEO Kenneth Lay seem to have come up with a business model that works for just about anything. They provide a service to their customers by packaging a supply of name your commodity and then using the efficiency of their vast network to beat most prices. They arrived at this model back in the mid-1980s almost out of desperation, when crude-oil prices had collapsed, natural-gas deregulation had thrown that market into chaos, and the Peruvian government had just nationalized Enron's offshore properties. Figuring they might as well leverage deregulation instead of succumbing to it--call it business judo-- Skilling, a McKinsey & Co. consultant at the time, came up with a plan called the Gas Bank, to buy up reserves of natural gas, then package them for sale, with various prices and conditions for different customers. When electricity markets deregulated a few years ago, the company did the same. It's the oldest concept in business: buy low, sell high. Enron also leverages its assets and expertise to provide services to big customers. Since 1997, companies like Owens Corning and Chase Manhattan Bank have signed long-term, multibillion-dollar contracts with Enron subsidiary Enron Energy Services (EES) that lock in their energy costs for up to 10 years and provide Enron with a steady revenue stream. What's more, Enron is beginning to actively manage its clients' heating and cooling plants, installing new equipment when necessary and monitoring it all over the Internet. Skilling's latest gambit is to apply the same principles he learned in the power and energy sectors to making Enron a leader in the booming telecommunications business. The plan isn't to go head to head with established fiber-optic carriers such as AT&T, Qwest and Williams Communications. Instead, Enron wants to use new switching technology and its expertise in trading pipeline access to transform a modest telecom network into a powerful arbiter of bandwidth. Enron's bet is simple: supply and demand will increase exponentially, turning bandwidth into a tradable commodity, just like gas and electricity. Along the way, why not partner with companies such as Blockbuster and use this new technology to offer content--like movies- -and blow it through existing, underutilized pipe? ""They are jump- starting an application [telecom content] with a potential market of $200 billion a year,"" says Tom Nolle, president of the telecom consulting firm CIMI. Other new-economy players are also beginning to see the power merchant as a prize partner. IBM and AOL have joined with Enron to form the New Power Co. (TNPC), an independent start-up that will offer pricing schemes and a choice of power and gas service for residential and small-business customers. Enron provides the electricity; AOL enables customers to buy it via the Web; and IBM takes care of the billing. ""It's ludicrous that we're in the 21st century, and you still have people jumping over fences to read meters,"" says Skilling, pointing out that the technology exists to offer real-time pricing for gas and electricity. In deregulated markets, TNPC will allow consumers to switch power companies as easily as they do phone companies. Despite all Wall Street's enthusiasm for Enron's bold plans, there are still plenty of skeptics. Critics point out that there is barely a market today for the company's bandwidth trading exchange. They also stress that pushing digital signals through pipe is a world away from routing natural gas. Although there is plenty of cable across the country, carriers are not set up to mix and match access to it. ""It's a very, very difficult concept,"" says Nolles. Even the Blockbuster venture is risky: technology aside, there is also the highly political question of digital rights. How do you satisfy Hollywood that its content is secure? But Skilling and his lieutenants are quick to counter that everyone thought they were crazy to try to make markets in gas and electricity. And Enron, after all, is a company that thrives on entrepreneurial defiance of convention. Many of its new ventures were started because managers simply set new ideas in motion without waiting for approval from the top. Even the online operation was cobbled together in a mere seven months. Skilling and Lay found out about EnronOnline only two weeks before it went live. Is taking risks really a part of a gas-pipeline company's culture? Just ask John Arnold, the 26-year-old chief of natural-gas derivatives, who after nine hours and $1 billion in trades last Wednesday had this to say: ""You can't turn away for a minute or you get picked off."" That has happened to too many traditional companies because they were unable to find a niche in the new economy. Enron, however, has traded its way into a starring role, and now it hopes it is ready for the movies.

I was flying over Bolivia's Chiquitano Forest as I read your article on the ""old-time gas company"" Enron [BUSINESS, Aug. 28]. Over the past year, this forest, the largest remnant of intact primary dry tropical forest in the world, has been bisected by a 30-ft.-wide gash for construction of a gas pipeline by Enron and Shell. Enron in its quest for profit has ignored the scientific advice of conservation organizations to maintain the ecological integrity of this endangered forest ecosystem. Enron and Shell decided to open the 10 million- acre forest to fragmentation and deforestation by their pipeline. Enron may be keeping pace with advancing technologies to plow ahead in global markets, but its environmental practices are Byzantine and pose a global threat to biodiversity. PATRICIA CAFFREY World Wildlife Fund-Bolivia Santa Cruz, Bolivia Arena foes launch bid to defeat new plan By ERIC BERGER Copyright 2000 Houston Chronicle Wednesday, October 4, 2000 A handful of activists, including a Harris County Green Party official and several low-tax proponents, launched an effort Tuesday to defeat a second plan to build a downtown arena. Unlike the 1999 opposition campaign, this year's anti-arena movement is not seeking a better financing deal for taxpayers. These activists want no arena at all. Although this year's opponents lack the nearly $700,000 their higher-profile predecessors spent last year, that has done little to diminish their rhetoric. ""Should we spend our city's limited resources on building up rich guys, or do we spend it building up our communities?"" asked activist DeWayne Lark, standing in front of City Hall. ""There will be no more corporate welfare in Harris County."" Pro-arena campaign officials said Tuesday's event, which came about three weeks after their own kickoff, was more notable for who did not attend than for who did. Houston Aeros owner Chuck Watson, who funded a large chunk of last year's anti-arena effort, has endorsed the new deal. Gracie Saenz, a former city councilwoman and mayoral candidate who campaigned against the 1999 deal, also supports the new agreement. And although the Harris County Republican Party -- the primary organizer of the 1999 anti-arena effort -- has declined to support the new deal, it has not been as active in opposition as some of its members had hoped. In the GOP's stead this year is the Harris County Green Party, represented by Nathalie Paravicini, who said she rejects the argument that professional sports are critical to a city's identity. Arena boosters say a new downtown facility will promote Houston's image as a world-class city. ""Civic pride is not measured by a sports team that is ready to leave town at the drop of a hat,"" she said. And organizers of the anti-arena campaign also suggested that conservative political activist Bruce Hotze would announce plans Thursday to take a major role in their efforts, possibly becoming campaign manager. Although Hotze lacks the political and financial stature of the pro-arena campaign co-chairmen, Enron Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lay and former Reliant Energy Chairman Don Jordan, he comes from a politically active family that can raise large amounts of money. Hotze has said he does not believe government should be involved in building sports stadiums, but he has declined to say how much he was willing to get involved in the anti-arena effort. Lark said Hotze told him that he will actively raise funds to fight the arena. The group is expected to form a political action committee this week to collect contributions. The philosophy of the anti-sports-arena efforts has reverted to its 1996 form, when a similar grass-roots effort coalesced to oppose the referendum to build a baseball stadium, which voters approved. That underfunded effort also opposed any public spending on stadiums, rather than merely trying to extract a better deal from team owners. Arena proponents this year have attracted most of their former foes, and certainly the best-known, to their ranks by altering the original proposal, which failed with voters last year by 10 percentage points. Still, they acknowledge that there will always be opposition in high-profile contests. ""We never expected this to be a unanimous vote,"" said Jordan, the co-chairman of the pro-arena campaign, Let's Build it Together. ""Some people will vote against anything."" FRANCE: Europe online power markets seen pressuring brokers. By Stuart Penson 10/03/2000 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2000. PARIS, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Online trading is set to sweep through Europe's power markets, sending transaction fees sharply lower and piling the pressure on traditional brokers, industry executives and consultants said on Tuesday. Scores of web-based trading platforms, offering a variety of functions, are expected to enter the European wholesale power market in the near term, forcing brokers who work over the telephone to rethink their approach, they told an energy conference. ""Transaction fees in Europe are already falling and I think we're going to see a big decline over the next six months,"" said Gilbert Toppin, principal of Deloitte Consulting's European e-business practice. ""Voice broking could become a distant memory,"" he told Reuters during the Powerisk 2000 conference. Leading the online charge in Europe's wholesale power market are EnronOnline, which launched last year, and HoustonStreet.com, which started up last week and is already planning to expand into Scandinavia. EnronOnline is a bilateral market in which Enron is always one party to a deal. HoustonStreet is a multilateral exchange. The major advantages for online markets over telephone brokers are seen as lower transaction costs and the ability to display a far wider range of prices to clients. Also, online trading is anonymous, which is attractive to traders, said Mark Crosno, president of electronic trading services at Altra Energy Technologies of the US. Altra is a partner with National Grid in EnMO in the UK, a consortium which runs a screen-based gas trading market and is planning to launch a power exchange. Many traditional brokers are still deciding how to respond to the online challenge. ""A lot of brokers are scratching their heads because there are going to be 20 or 25 electronic exchanges out there,"" said Per-Otto Wold, managing director of Natsource-Tullett Europe, one of Europe's biggest power brokers. Wold argued that doing a trade over the telephone was still, in most cases, the quickest method. And that would remain so until voice recognition enabled traders to ""talk"" to the screens on their desks. He expected brokers to focus on longer dated trades and options while online markets would capture a greater share of trading in short term, high volume contracts. The provision of market information and traders' liking for personal contact over the telephone would also help to preserve a niche for the voice brokers, said Wold. ""The markets are still going to need somebody to massage the markets, and that is where the brokers come in,"" he said. Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

I'm still awaiting additional suggestions from anyone on speakers. I guess Lee's e-mail changes things. If the business school wants to go forward with a conference anyway then it may be a bad idea to have a separate one. Jeff has said he likes the idea of coordinating. Bill and Allen, what do you think? I will chime in that Carl Shapiro is very much a big wig, as a former chief economist at DOJ. As for the Frank Wolak suggestion, Frank is a Stanford economist who is an outstanding analyst and has published probably more than anyone else on electricity market design performance, regarding the UK, Australia, and California. He speaks a mile a minute though and his understanding of policy and politics is a bit naive. I should note that ICF will not be able to contribute. I heard from Michael Berg this morning. So he will not be participating in our discussions either. My opinion is let's do whatever is best for the school. One positive outcome of this would be stronger relationships with some of the University's top notch economic policy faculty. Overshadowing is possible.

Subject:: Summary of Administration Comments on Bingaman Bill
Body:: I have read through the 19 pages of Administration comments on the Bingaman draft electricity bill released last month. Here are the main items in a quick bullet format so you have the flavor of them. Delete provision on federal jurisdiction over bundled/unbundled (they don't offer a reason). We of course agree for tactical reasons. Add a provision to authorize FERC to order wheeling in States that open retail markets. Add a provision to allow FERC to issue wheeling orders on its own motion based on an informal hearing rather than an adjudicatory hearing as under current law. Make it clear that the Federal Power Act does not affect the authority of a State to require retail competition (the comments say some utilities have tried to argue that the FPA prohibits states). The provision giving FERC power to order RTO participation should be deleted. The comments raise drafting question. The changes to the FERC merger review sections of the FPA should be limited. ""FERC lite"" should be extended only to state municipal utilities and cooperatives, not the Federal utilities. The FERC should authority over the Federal transmission systems equivalent to FERC authority over public utilities (with special BPA rules). No need to legislate on market-based rates (we oppose the Bingaman language anyway, so this is helpful). Interconnection language should be limited to transmission facilities, not local distribution. No objection to streamlined reliability provision (this is good for us). Remedial measures for market power should be deleted. Administration to provide legislative language on federal transmission siting provisions, which they want to retain. Not convinced there is a need for market transparency rules because FERC and DOE already have enough authority. Administration supports even tougher criminal penalties. Recordkeeping under PUHCA repeal should be clarified. Federal purchase requirement for renewable energy should be deleted. No objection to real-time pricing standard. Net metering should be limited to small residential renewable facilities. Do not support federal renewable portfolio standard (but could clarify state authority to adopt same).

Subject:: CFTC Reauthorization

I'll see him at Exec comm today. ---------------------- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/HOU/EES on 08/14/2000 08:54 AM --------------------------- Richard Shapiro 08/10/2000 06:11 PM To: Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES cc: Chris Long/Corp/Enron@ENRON Subject: CFTC Reauthorization I agree w/ chris's recommendation- you too? ---------------------- Forwarded by Richard Shapiro/HOU/EES on 08/10/2000 06:10 PM --------------------------- Chris Long@ENRON 08/10/2000 05:12 PM To: Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT, Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES, Richard Shapiro/HOU/EES@EES, Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Joe Hillings/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Cynthia Sandherr/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Tom Briggs/NA/Enron@Enron cc: raislerk@sullcrom.com, Allison Navin/Corp/Enron@ENRON Subject: CFTC Reauthorization At his request, I met Lee Sachs, Assistant Treasury Secretary, who had requested the meeting after a brief conversation recently. Lee said that senior-level negotiations led by Secretary Summers were initiated last week between the CFTC and SEC and that progress was being made on the single stock futures issue (the major issue postponing movement of the legislation). As you know, the House completed committee work on HR 4541 before it recessed. The bill will now is pending before the Rules Committee where differences will be worked out between the three different Committee versions (Agriculture, Commerce, and Banking). The Senate Agriculture Committee passed out the Senate version in July. However, the bill is not moving quickly in the Senate due to Senator Phil Gramm's desire to see significant changes made to the legislation (not directly related to our energy language). Last week at the Republican Convention, I asked the Senator about the bill and he said they were working on it, but much needs to be changed for his support. More telling perhaps, were Wendy Gramm's comments that she would rather the current bill die if a better bill can be passed next year. What this means is that we must, at the least, remove Senator Gramm's opposition to the bill to move the process and more importantly seek to gain his support of the legislation. Lee Sachs message was just that. I told Lee that we shared his desire to move the legislation as long as it contains a full exclusion for all non-agriculture commodities (including metals). He said that we would have a difficult time defending the metals provision politically. But, Lee said ""we would not find Treasury opposition to the House Commerce Committee language"" (which includes favourable language on energy and metals). This is a positive development, because it isolates the CFTC from its key defenders and I hope ensures no veto threat on our issues. However, I do not expect Treasury to be vocal in support of our position. It is clear that Congressional leaders and the Administration want to get this bill done this year and there remains a good opportunity for enactment. However, with less than 20 or so legislative days left, we need Senator Gramm to engage. A call from Ken Lay in the next two weeks to Senator Gramm could be an impetus for Gramm to move his staff to resolve the differences. Gramm needs to fully understand how helpful the bill is to Enron. Let me know your thoughts on this approach. I am prepared to assist in coordinating the call and drafting the talking points for a Ken Lay/Sen. Gramm call.

Subject:: Update Day 1 Second Session FERC CA Settlement
Body:: In the Room Conference attended by all in-state generators, a few munies, the IOUs and a few others. One attorney from CPUC, but on phone. Barbara Barkovich attended for CA Large Consumers. Nader sent someone. No other consumers. One other ESP -- Strategic Energy (only operates in San Diego). Judge reports that only 6 offers have been submitted to FERC for sales to the IOUs (note; Enron submitted one of the offers). The offers total 2000 MW. The prices are quite divergent. He expresses concern at the little offered. Generators suggest that more could be offered if FERC could be more flexible on terms (FERC required 24/7 offers). IOUs and others press judge to seek offers from others not present (e.g., BPA, other marketers, SW utilities), but judge does not offer to do so. Barkovich says can't throw large customers into non-core market now. Everyone agrees that we are all looking for a blended wholesale rate (part existing gen, part OFs, part forward contract and part spot) that meshes with the IOUs' ability to recover the costs in rates -- so tied to CPUC rate increase. Discussion of CPUC PD -- not enough Enron able to take low profile. SDG&E suggested terminating the settlement talks at FERC, saying nothing could be achieved. Not much happens until 4:30 pm, when judge blows up -- judge directed epithets at SDG&E and SCE. SCE had refused to cooperate from the beginning. Out of the Room Separate talks between PG&E and SDG&E and some of the generators. Late in the day, Judge meets with IOUs. Parties agree informally that forum does not work well given lack of CPUC involvement, but some believe that FERC is only hope for a workable resolution. Next Steps -- The Judge Speaks Judge asked everyone to consider how to ""Share the Pain"" for Thursday's meeting and said not to expect any ""win:win"" scenario. His view is that FERC is better than the CA legislature or bankruptcy court. His focus will be on Wolak proposal to share the pain, as submitted in 12/1/00 comments to FERC -- forces all sellers to CA to sell most of its supply (either generation or marketer offers) as cost-based rates in forward contracts, or lose ability to sell at market-based rates. Generators oppose this, I believe. Enron planning to continue low profile but to discuss options with ENA.

Subject:: RE: Bingaman reliability draft language
Body:: It is important to point out that under the Bingaman reliability language, FERC has total discretion as to whether to adopt a NERC standard. Charles does make a good point about the deference language. As written, FERC has discretion to defer to NERC or an RTO to monitor and enforce compliance. At a minimum, that language should be expanded to include another entity like an EISB. Similarly, the language should probably be tweaked to allow FERC to adopt standards of an organization other than NERC. -----Original Message----- From: Yeung, Charles Sent: Friday, October 12, 2001 9:14 AM To: Shelk, John; Shapiro, Richard; Robertson, Linda; Steffes, James D.; Bestard, Jose; Walton, Steve; Perrino, Dave; Novosel, Sarah; Shortridge, Pat; Nicolay, Christi L. Subject: RE: Bingaman reliability draft language I understand that the NERC needs to be recognized for political reasons - but this shuts out the possibility of a EISB. Since it recognizes RTOs, it should alos leave open the possibility of yet another entity to perform the reliability standards setting function, at least allow for the RTOs to work through a central standards setting organization other than NERC. -----Original Message----- From: Shelk, John Sent: Thursday, October 11, 2001 10:31 AM To: Shapiro, Richard; Robertson, Linda; Steffes, James D.; Yeung, Charles; Bestard, Jose; Walton, Steve; Perrino, Dave; Novosel, Sarah; Shortridge, Pat; Nicolay, Christi L.

By Dale Kasler Bee Staff Writer (Published April 20, 2001)=20 Adding to the risk of summertime blackouts, the state water department said= =20 Thursday it might not pay ""ridiculous"" prices for electricity even if that= =20 leaves California short of power.=20 The Department of Water Resources, which has been buying electricity for th= e=20 state's two beleaguered utilities since mid-January, wouldn't spell out wha= t=20 it considers ridiculous. But if prices get too high, the state might be=20 better off ordering blackouts or implementing proposed new conservation=20 programs designed at cutting usage on short notice, said Raymond Hart, the= =20 department's deputy director in charge of power purchases.=20 Gov. Gray Davis took a different view, saying: ""We will continue to keep th= e=20 lights on. When you're fighting a forest fire, you don't say, 'Let me see,= =20 how much is this going to cost me? Maybe I can't write the check, maybe I= =20 can't put the fire out.' You put the fire out and then worry about the cost= =20 later.""=20 But Davis' spokesman, Steve Maviglio, said the Governor's Office indeed is= =20 contemplating whether to refuse to buy power at any cost. ""At what point do= es=20 the state say, 'Enough is enough'? Those scenarios are certainly under=20 discussion,"" Maviglio said.=20 The water department until recently resisted buying all the power Southern= =20 California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. needed, refusing to=20 purchase electricity it deemed too costly. But lately it's had to relax tha= t=20 stance because of an order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Har= t=20 said.=20 That April 6 order said power generators can no longer be forced to sell=20 electricity to uncreditworthy entities such as the Independent System=20 Operator, which manages the state's power grid. Because the ISO -- which ge= ts=20 its money from the utilities -- can no longer buy the power, the water=20 department is now buying all the electricity required by the utilities, Har= t=20 said. But he said the department could back off if prices get out of hand.= =20 ""If the prices just get ridiculous altogether, there's a policy call to be= =20 made, and we'll cross that bridge when we get there,"" Hart said.=20 The ISO has predicted that severe shortages could bring 34 days of rolling= =20 blackouts this summer. The potential refusal of the water department to buy= =20 ultra-expensive power could further strain the grid.=20 ""On a daily basis we're dealt a set of cards,"" said ISO spokesman Patrick= =20 Dorinson. ""It sounds like ... we're going to be handed another set of cards= ,=20 and we're going to have to try to maintain the reliability of the grid as= =20 best we can.""=20 Hart's comments came amid an increasingly rancorous debate between Davis an= d=20 PG&E over the water department's power expenditures. State spending shot up= =20 following PG&E's April 6 filing for bankruptcy protection.=20 Davis said generators began demanding a ""credit penalty"" from the water=20 department because of the PG&E bankruptcy proceedings. As a result, the=20 state's daily costs shot up last week to $73.2 million from $57.4 million i= n=20 the week before PG&E went bankrupt, the governor's office said.=20 Hart agreed, saying several generators raised their prices. ""Every time=20 there's a major hiccup in the market, such as PG&E bankruptcy or a staged= =20 alert by the ISO, there's a price run-up,"" Hart said.=20 But prices have settled down this week. After peaking at $345 a megawatt ho= ur=20 April 12, prices for north state power were at $243 on Thursday, just below= =20 what they were prior to the bankruptcy filing, according to the Enerfax new= s=20 service.=20 PG&E, however, said its bankruptcy filing had nothing to do with the state'= s=20 increased spending.=20 ""This claim is simply not accurate,"" the utility said in a memo to reporter= s.=20 Rather, the increased spending is due solely to the fact that the water=20 department is buying more units of electricity in the wake of the FERC orde= r,=20 PG&E said.=20 Regardless of the cause, the increased spending by the water department cou= ld=20 further strain the state's budget -- and complicate Davis' plan to finance= =20 the power purchases through a bond offering.=20 The state has committed $5.2 billion from its general fund for power=20 purchases since January. Those mounting purchases, along with PG&E's=20 bankruptcy filing and other energy crisis uncertainties, prompted a third= =20 Wall Street credit rating agency, Fitch, to place the state on a ""ratings= =20 watch"" this week, meaning the rating might be downgraded.=20 A downgrade could raise California's borrowing costs. All three of the=20 leading Wall Street credit agencies now have California on a ratings watch.= =20 Meanwhile, the state Public Utilities Commission on Thursday ordered an=20 investigation of why hundreds of cogenerators and other alternative energy= =20 providers haven't resumed production even though they've begun receiving=20 payments again from Edison and PG&E.=20 These generators, under contract to the utilities, provide more than 20=20 percent of the state's energy supply.

By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer (Published April 20, 2001)=20 Ten years of stable electricity bills vanished in a single unanimous vote= =20 Thursday night as directors of Sacramento Municipal Utility District gave= =20 tentative approval to rate hikes ranging from 19 percent to 27 percent.=20 The new rates will go into effect immediately after a final vote, scheduled= =20 for May 3.=20 ""This is quite alarming to all of us,"" said director Peter Keat.

Rainfall and snowmelt that feed SMUD's=20 hydroelectric plants on the upper American River are about 53 percent of=20 normal to date.=20 But during a two-hour hearing, a small contingent of consumers asked the=20 board to reconsider.=20 ""I realize that rates have to go up, but this seems like a big percentage a= ll=20 at once,"" said Marian Ender.=20 Several criticized a 6 percent surcharge that until only a few days before= =20 had been proposed at 3 percent. Among them was Duy Tu, an engineering manag= er=20 at Intel who served on SMUD's advisory rate committee.=20 The increase ""cannot come at a worse time"" for Intel, he said, although he= =20 understands the need for it. He urged the board to act now to make more=20 electricity available in the future.=20 ""We are way too dependent on some external force to keep the lights on,"" Tu= =20 said.=20 Overall, a base rate increase averaging 16 percent will raise about $124=20 million annually for SMUD, and a special=20 6 percent surcharge will raise about $48 million in its first year.

Darrell E. Issa (R-Vista), said of the unusual spirit of=20 cooperation at the meeting near Los Angeles International airport. ?????Members of both parties said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission= =20 must slash wholesale electricity prices so California utilities can once=20 again afford to buy power. Since January, the state government has been=20 buying electricity on their behalf, as skyrocketing wholesale prices put=20 Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison billions of dolla= rs=20 into debt and many power suppliers refused to sell to them; PG&E has since= =20 filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. ?????Although the Bush administration has said repeatedly that it is strong= ly=20 opposed to price caps, and FERC has refused to grant them, California=20 Republicans at the energy meeting said they are optimistic that the=20 administration will agree to some other form of price regulation. They=20 brushed aside the notion that such regulations might conflict with their=20 ideological belief in a free market. ?????""This is not a free-enterprise situation,"" Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Alpin= e)=20 said after the meeting. ""In fact, it's just the opposite."" ?????Specifically citing the huge disparity between natural gas prices=20 charged to California and those charged in other Western states, he said=20 California clearly has been the victim of unreasonably high energy costs.= =20 Under federal law, the FERC must regulate the prices of companies if it fin= ds=20 they are exerting ""market power"" to drive prices to unreasonable levels. ?????Executives from two Texas energy companies, meeting with legislators i= n=20 Sacramento, denied Thursday that they had caused natural gas prices in=20 California to artificially skyrocket by hoarding access to a critical=20 pipeline into the state. ?????After the extraordinary meeting in Los Los Angeles, Rep. Brad Sherman= =20 (D-Sherman Oaks) said the biggest disagreement between California Democrats= =20 and Republicans appeared to be their relative faith--or lack thereof--in th= e=20 ability of President Bush and his administration to help California. There= =20 has been much speculation that Bush, who lost California in November, has n= o=20 political motive to help the state. ?????""We Democrats,"" said Sherman, ""hope very much that our skepticism is= =20 proven wrong."" ?????Davis--who sat flanked by Democratic U.S. Sen.

""With these prices, you want to sell every=20 molecule."" ?????In other developments Thursday: ?????* The agreement between Davis and Edison International to return its= =20 ailing utility arm to financial health is in ""deep trouble and could be=20 rejected by legislators,"" the Standard & Poor's credit rating agency said i= n=20 a note to clients, citing legislative and other sources. A rejection of the= =20 deal ""would be a humiliating setback for the governor,"" S&P said. ?????The agreement calls for, among other things, the sale of Edison's=20 transmission grid to the state for $2.76 billion and the sale of $2 billion= =20 in bonds--both designed to pay off the utility's huge electricity debt.=20 Edison agreed to several constraints, including the sale of electricity to= =20 the state at prices tied to the cost of producing power. ?????Since they returned Monday from a two-week recess, state legislators= =20 have been sharply critical of the Edison agreement and have indicated a=20 desire to tinker with aspects of the deal. Some lawmakers have said publicl= y=20 that a bankruptcy protection filing by Edison, like that of PG&E, might not= =20 be such a dire outcome. ?????But a senior Edison executive said it is ""way too early"" to give up on= =20 passage of the proposal, which legislators have not yet seen in official fo= rm. ?????""There is an education process to do here,"" the executive said of the= =20 highly detailed 38-page document. ""The legislators should be asking=20 questions. That is appropriate."" ?????* The Public Utilities Commission voted to investigate whether=20 alternative energy providers violated contractual agreements by withholding= =20 supplies from PG&E and Edison, which owe them hundreds of millions of dolla= rs. ?????The action, Commissioner Carl W. Wood said, was prompted in part by=20 lawsuits some providers have filed seeking release from their contracts wit= h=20 the cash-starved utilities. The producers of solar, wind and geothermal=20 energy account for more than 25% of California's electricity supply. ?????""The question is whether we will be able to rely on them in the long,= =20 hot days of summer,"" Wood said. ?????Jack Raudy of the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee said the PUC=20 needs to address the $700 million the producers are owed. ""All we have gott= en=20 is rhetoric from the governor, the PUC and the utilities,"" he said. ?????* An $850-million plan to entice Californians to conserve precious=20 megawatts appears to be running into roadblocks, compounding predictions by= =20 state officials of tighter than expected energy supplies in May and June. ?????Davis signed the conservation spending package last week, earmarking= =20 $242 million of the new funds for the Public Utilities Commission to=20 distribute to the state's investor-owned utilities to support existing=20 conservation programs. ?????But Barbara Hale, director of the PUC's Division of Strategic Planning= ,=20 said Thursday that since Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy=20 protection April 6, the utility has stopped releasing conservation funds. ?????Hale, testifying before a state Senate committee, said PG&E's=20 decision--coupled with the threat that Southern California Edison could=20 follow a similar route to U.S. Bankruptcy Court--has complicated her agency= 's=20 efforts. ?????PG&E spokeswoman Staci Homrig said her company plans to petition the= =20 Bankruptcy Court to have the conservation funds designated as a trust and= =20 separated from assets tied up in the bankruptcy proceedings.

(AP) via NewsEdge Corporation - Gov. Kenny Guinn signed a bill Wednesday that would stop the sale of Nevada power plants, halt deregulation and bail out struggling utilities with a new rate system. The Senate and Assembly gave the measure final approval earlier in the day and rushed it to the governor. The bill was crafted to keep Nevada from suffering from a power crisis similar to California's. ``I must tell you this is a great relief,'' said Guinn, a former utility executive, as he signed the bill into law. ``Nothing can control escalating costs, but we're in the best position to protect ourselves.'' Legislators made a last-minute change to add language that ensured consumers would get a break on rates if utilities profit from sales of excess power to other states. Guinn said the bill takes care of the most pressing energy issues, but other deregulation-related bills are sure to follow. That includes a plan that would allow major power users, such as casinos and mines, to buy power on the open market. Legislators also are working on plans encouraging energy conservation and ensuring the poor can pay their utility bills. --- --- ----- PG&E Co. Issues Statements On the Increase in the State's Cost for Power SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 18, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation - FROM: John Nelson, Director of the News Department Pacific Gas and Electric Company There seems to have been some confusion yesterday over the effect Pacific Gas and Electric Company's bankruptcy filing may have had on energy prices. I thought it might be helpful to provide a few useful facts and figures, to help you pin down the truth behind what may be driving the state's energy costs higher. Yesterday, Governor Davis claimed that the state was paying roughly $20 million more for electricity every day as a direct result of the bankruptcy filing by PG&amp;E. While it's understandable, even laudable, that the Governor would want to fully explain the downsides of utility bankruptcy, this claim is simply not accurate. The Governor should know better. Consider the facts: -- On January 19, the credit ratings of California's two largest investor-owned utilities -- PG&amp;E and SCE -- were downgraded to below investment grade by every major rating agency. Generators immediately raised concerns about continuing to sell power to such non-creditworthy entities. -- The state reacted by passing AB7x, which authorized the state Department of Water Resources to make $400 million in power purchases. Less than two weeks later, on February 1, the Governor signed AB1x, which authorized DWR to buy power on an ongoing basis at least through 2002, until the utilities could be restored to creditworthiness. The clear understanding in the legislative debate was that the DWR would purchase the full ""net open position"", which is the amount of additional generation needed, beyond what the utilities themselves own or have under contract, to meet customer demand. However, a few weeks later, in spite of the clear intent of state law, it was revealed that DWR was not buying the full net open position, and had no intention of doing so. It was only buying power that it considered ""reasonably priced"" and was leaving the ISO to buy whatever was necessary to keep the lights on -- an amount that most estimates place at 10- to 20-percent of the state's daily electricity need. -- The ISO, in turn, revealed its intention to attempt to pass along the costs of these last-minute, high-cost, spot-market purchases to the state's non-creditworthy utilities (despite existing FERC tariffs which precluded the ISO from doing so). PG&amp;E has estimated that its share of these costs was roughly $10 million a day; SCE has a similar estimate. (We don't know for sure, because we haven't seen the bill. The DWR won't say how much power it's buying, and at what cost, and neither will the ISO.) -- On February 14, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission informed the Independent System Operator that it could not force generators to sell to non-creditworthy entities (namely, both PG&amp;E and SCE). This order appeared to force the DWR to purchase the full net open after all. The ISO responded the next day with its own interpretation of the FERC order, saying the order was limited to ""emergency"" power only. The ISO also sought and obtained in federal court a temporary restraining order (issued by Judge Damrell), forcing generators to continue selling to it. -- On February 22, five power generators filed a complaint with FERC seeking to clarify that the ISO's interpretation of the February 14 order was contrary to FERC's intent. -- On April 5, the Ninth U.S. Court of Appeals reversed Judge Damrell's lower court order affecting one of the generators, Reliant, saying the generator was no longer required to sell electricity to the ISO without assurances of payment. Presumably this order would apply to other generators, if they sought such assurances. -- On April 6, PG&amp;E noted in the announcement of its Chapter 11 filing that one of the reasons for the decision was the ""financial exposure to unreimbursed wholesale energy procurement costs"" caused by the state's failure to assume the full procurement responsibility. -- On April 6, unrelated to PG&amp;E's bankruptcy filing, FERC issued an order responding to the generators' Feb. 22 complaint against the ISO. In this new order, FERC reaffirmed its February 14 order that the ISO could only buy power on behalf of creditworthy entities, meaning neither PG&amp;E nor SCE. -- On April 9 in remarks reported in the press, the Governor's office acknowledged the State's ""bill for energy purchases will increase by upward of $8 million a day after a ruling last week by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,"" once DWR started buying the full net open position, rather than force the ISO to try to bill the utilities. It seems likely that the $8 million was an estimate based on only one of the utilities' costs, not the combination of both. -- On April 11, the ISO discontinued its daily practice of publishing the total amount it spent on energy the day before. -- Despite the history, the state continues to try to avoid buying the full net open position. On April 13, in response to the FERC order -- NOT the PG&amp;E bankruptcy filing -- the ISO sent a ""murky"" notice to generators promising that ""any bid accepted by the ISO will be deemed to have the financial support of another Qualified Party or DWR as specified in this notice."" Generators were reportedly underwhelmed by the assurances contained in the letter. -- Yesterday, in response to the Governor's claim that bankruptcy was driving up the state's costs, Gary Ackerman, spokesman for the Western Power Trading Forum, said ""I don't believe, nor have I ever heard, of a bankruptcy surcharge being added to the cost of power.... If anything, I think that generators and marketers would take solace in the fact that bankruptcy brings order to an otherwise volatile situation."" What does it all mean? Clearly, the increase in the state's costs have come as a result of the DWR finally covering the state's energy needs, as promised in AB1x. This change in DWR's buying habits has come as a direct result of the February 14 and April 6 FERC orders that the ISO only sell to creditworthy entities. These orders were issued independent of PG&amp;E's bankruptcy filing and apply equally to PG&amp;E and SCE. Neither PG&amp;E nor SCE have been creditworthy since mid-January, when their credit ratings were reduced to below investment grade, and the DWR, ISO and Governor's office have been aware of the effect of the FERC order since mid-February. Some generators have suggested that California has been paying a credit penalty since December, when the utilities' deteriorating financial situation gave rise to payment concerns. There appears to be far more evidence that the state's coy approach to AB1x implementation has created far more uncertainty in the marketplace than has PG&amp;E's Chapter 11 filing.

Power and Associates Reports/ Nationwide Decline in Customer=20 Satisfaction of Electric Utility Service Among Midsize Businesses Price and Value Performance Hit Hard Across Nation; Satisfaction in California Continues to Plummet AGOURA HILLS, Calif., April 19 /PRNewswire/ -- Midsize business customers, who are responsible for approximately fifteen percent of the nation's electricity consumption, are very critical of electricity prices, according= to the J.D. Power and Associates 2001 Electric Utility Midsize Business Custom= er Satisfaction Study(SM) released today. Consequently, the study's nationwid= e customer satisfaction index fell -- from 100 points in 2000 to 97 in 2001. (Photo: ) ""The entire country was affected by higher natural gas prices this winter, and with more states re-evaluating deregulation, midsize business customers are especially sensitive to electricity prices,"" said Jeffrey Conklin, seni= or director at J.D. Power and Associates. The 2001 study shows that average overall customer satisfaction with California's ""big three"" investor-owned utilities -- Pacific Gas and Electr= ic, San Diego Gas and Electric, and Southern California Edison -- fell an astonishing 14 index points among midsize businesses compared to the 2000 study. ""In California, electric utility satisfaction among midsize business customers has virtually fallen into the Pacific,"" said Alan Destribats, executive director of the utility practice at J.D. Power and Associates. The study finds that the chief determinants of satisfaction among electric utility midsize customers are a provider's company image, price and value, = and power quality and reliability. As expected, midsize business customers were extremely critical of performance in the areas of company image and price and value. Even outsid= e of California, satisfaction in the price and value component fell more than any other factor -- from an index score of 100 in 2000 to 93 in 2001. Power Quality and Reliability Utility performance in power quality and reliability is improving, with the national index increasing by 3 points. Although the number of interruptions and outages experienced was relatively the same in 2001 as it was in 2000, midsize businesses report much shorter outage durations, falli= ng from an average of seven hours for the longest outages in 2000 to four hour= s in 2001. Retail Competition ""Opening utility markets to competition has proven to be a difficult process and, so far, midsize business customers are giving the industry poo= r marks,"" said Destribats. The study shows that midsize business customers located in states with competition not only are less satisfied than are customers in other states, but they are also significantly less satisfied now than last year. The stu= dy also shows that more midsize businesses have switched electricity providers= . Of midsize businesses eligible to switch power suppliers, 9 percent have do= ne so, up from 5 percent in 2000. J.D. Power and Associates interviewed representatives from more than 7,200 midsize businesses, including manufacturers, retailers, business and consumer services firms, health care providers and other midsize businesses throughout the United States. Midsize business owners are defined as those who normally spend $1,500 to $25,000 per month on electricity. The study shows that midsize businesses are now spending an average of $4,827 per mon= th on electricity. The study shows that utilities in the south region of the United States consistently receive higher ratings across all factors of customer satisfaction. Likewise, these midsize business customers also report the lowest levels of monthly electricity expenditures, on average. Midsize businesses in North Carolina spend the least for electric usage ($3,885 per month on average), while those in New Hampshire, Nevada and Utah spend the most ($5,700 to $5,800 per month on average). The study also shows that midsize businesses in Alabama and Florida report the most service interruptions and outages within the past 12 months, and those in Washingto= n report the fewest. East Region PPL Utilities, serving east Pennsylvania, ranks highest in overall customer satisfaction with midsize businesses in the eastern United States. PPL Utilities ranked highest in the East Region in four of the six factors that comprise customer satisfaction, with its primary strength in price and value. Other solid performers in this region include Public Service Electr= ic and Gas, Allegheny Power and GPU Energy. Midwest Region LG&amp;E Energy, the parent company of Kentucky Utilities and Louisville Ga= s and Electric, ranks highest in overall customer satisfaction with midsize business electric service in the Midwest. LG&amp;E Energy midsize business customers give high ratings for power quality and reliability, customer service, and billing and payment. Alliant Energy, AEP-Midwest and Xcel Energy-NSP also rank high in midsize business customer satisfaction in the Midwest Region. South Region Southern Company ranks highest in overall customer satisfaction for midsize business electric service in the South Region and received the high= est customer satisfaction index score among all utilities included in the study= . Southern Company dominates all other electric utility service providers, achieving the highest ratings in the nation in five of the six components (2 in a tie). Other strong performers in the South Region include Duke Pow= er, Florida Power &amp; Light and Progress Energy (Carolina Power &amp; Light a= nd=20 Florida Power). West Region Sierra Pacific Resources ranks highest in overall customer satisfaction with midsize business electric service in the West Region. This utility significantly leads the region by rating highest in all six components (1 i= n a tie). The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power also ranks high in thi= s region.

Body:: ---------------------- Forwarded by Michael Burke/Houston/Eott on 03/01/2000 08:16 AM --------------------------- Steve Duffy 02/29/2000 02:16 PM To: Susan Ralph, Bob Jacobs, Scott Clark/Bakersfield/Eott@Eott, Michael Burke, Gary Fuller/Bakersfield/Eott@Eott, Dana Gibbs, Lori Maddox/Houston/Eott@Eott, Cutty Cunningham/Houston/Eott@Eott, Mary Ellen Coombe/Houston/Eott@Eott, Walt Zimmerman, Mike Frank/Houston/Eott@Eott, Molly Sample, Edward Attanasio cc: Scott Vonderheide/Corp/Enron@Enron Subject: California Truck Wreck on 2/28 Involving Cummings and an Ex-EOTT Driver; CONFIDENTIAL AND PRIVILEGED ATTORNEY/CLIENT COMMUNICATION AND ATTORNEY'S WORK PRODUCT I believe most of you have seen the background/facts on this unfortunate accident in which (1) an ex-EOTT employee (Hildebrand) was killed and (2) a tank load of crude oil was emptied into a California river. The oil belonged to Tosco. We had/have a contract to haul this oil for Tosco and were performing through Cummings. We outsourced our crude oil hauling function in California to Cummings and other companies last year, and many of our former crude drivers went to work for Cummings and these companies. The oil has gone into navigable waters and has reached the Pacific Ocean (during spawning season). This incident is on the front page of today's L.A. Times Metro Section. ACCORDING TO ED ATTANASIO, NEITHER EOTT NOR ENRON IS MENTIONED IN THE TIMES COVERAGE. It is quite possible that Tosco will seek indemnity from us (in connection with this incident) under the terms of our hauling contract with them. The liabilities here for Tosco could be very significant. Ed Attanasio is monitoring this situation closely. We need to be sensitive to this situation for a number of reasons. Someone may tie EOTT or Enron to this incident, for the reasons above, and because of the L.A. Times exposure, we could receive media calls about this matter. Scott Vonderheide has been alerted in this regard. At this juncture, we need to decide where to refer any calls we receive on this matter. Until further notice, I would advise that any and all such calls be referred to Cutty Cunningham . Cutty, I think your response to any such calls should be that we did not own the truck or the oil, or employ the driver. We should otherwise state that we are investigating the matter and have no further comment at this time. Also, Lori and Molly, we will need to decide very soon whether this matter will have any 10K significance. At the appropriate time, we should see what Baird thinks. We will look to Cummings and their insurance carriers to indemnify us----and be responsible for any claims against us by Tosco-----but we are still trying to ascertain the value of any such indemnity from Cummings and/ or its carriers. We don't have enough information at this time to speculate on the magnitude of any exposure we may have in this matter. Ed Attanasio needs to confer with Susan Ralph and advise on this ASAP. Please advise if there are any questions. Thanks. SWD

Since Enron has gone through the expense of giving each and every employee the opportunity of the Click at Home program, it seems to be a somewhat redundant expense of which I might add is unnecessary in my opinion. I feel it would behoove ALL EMPLOYEES, including executives, to be more conscientious of costs and expenses to improve Enron's and EBS' bottom-line. How can we (""Enron"") be a world leading company if we don't have leading world leaders that spend Enron's money as if it were there own. I think it would be in Enron's best interest to set some guidelines regarding expenses such as these. Just because a person is an executive of the company why should be allowed to have anything they want just because they can? Thank you for your time and the opportunity to express myself. Especially since I am a shareholder also and care where the money goes.

Subject:: Re: Price Cap Media--DRAFT
Body:: I agree with Mona: we need to include some customer contacts . . . it gives them an opportunity to look smart about going to the marketplace and getting price protection. The messages need to include Palmer's top three: 1) price caps cause shortages (Rob- can you put together soe historical examples?); 2) better solutions are already available; and 3) short term politics makes for long term problems. On item 2) we need to talk about the competitive offerings to San Diego, the fixed price offerings available at retail, and the availability of conservation and demand side management technology today (including its availability to the consuming public from existing suppliers . . . ie you don't need to wait for Enron to make a consumer offering).

Media Action: In addition to doing behind the scenes editorial board meetings and the like, I would suggest that we get our coalition lined up and ready to release statements for certain key events which are likely to occur over the next several weeks, such as: 1. SDG&E's selection of the winning bid to their RFP. Even if Enron isn't selected as the winning bid, the coalition should trumpet the market-based solution and the enormous market response to SDG&E's RFP. 2. The Commission vote on UCAN's Emergency Motion. We should be prepared to issue a statement whether the Cmmn votes with us or against us. With us, the market can and did provide reasonable, expedient solutions to SDG&E's customers and protection from price spikes. Against us, despite the overwhelming market response, the Cmmn chose to ignore the market solutions and impose more regulation. 3. Potential for ARM members to surface a Provider of Last Resort proposal within the next couple of weeks. 4. ISO Bd. Mtg-keep up pressure against reducing price caps. Coalition Members: Agree that those groups listed should be contacted, although the CMA, CRA, CIU, CLECA have been luke-warm in their advocacy. I would add our customers (UC/CSU (especially the San Diego branch), PacTel, etc.) NewEnergy has indicated that Kroger/Ralph's grocery stores, San Diego-based, would give testimonials. I could solicit the members of ARM to identify a key customer contacts for interviews. We could check with our lobbyists and see who they would recommend (wine growers, dairy industry, etc.) We should also consider the water agencies and the rural counties and the City of Pittsburg. While the immediate message is responding to San Diego's situation, this latter group of potential coalition members would go to the larger message (keeping benefits of competitive markets) from a state-wide perspective. What about the City of Pittsburg?

Subject:: California Power Crisis Update (No. 10)
Body:: We have been pulling together these weekly(sometimes more often) summaries for internal purposes. Would you find it helpful to be on the distribution list? Hope you are doing well. Look forward to touching base soon. ----- Forwarded by Suzanne on 03/28/2001 03:41 AM ----- Memorandum TO: Pru Sheppard BCC: Suzanne Nimocks FROM: Pru Sheppard B. Venki Venkateshwara DATE: March 27, 2001 California Power Crisis Update (No. 10) DEVELOPMENTS THIS WEEK, 3/23/2001 The weeks highlights include: ? Continued indications that the issue of market power and possible remedies for it is likely to remain a high profile issue in California and elsewhere (both retroactively and prospectively) ? An ironical situation with respect to QFs in which QF power under contract is effectively being released into the market at higher prices ? A court order requiring Reliant to continue to sell power to the ISO even if it is not being paid in a full and timely manner ? Another Stage 3 emergency and rolling blackouts Market power There are continued indications that the issue of market power will not be settled simply. This week there was a lengthy and politically influential front page story in the New York Times about FERCs passive approach to policing generators (Critics Say U.S. Energy Agency Is Weak in Oversight of Utilities). The story was by Jeff Gerth and Joseph Kahn. (Jeff Gerth's 1992 story on the Whitewater deal is viewed by journalists to have been the origin of what eventually became a multi-year investigation of Bill Clinton.) The key issues are familiar: ? Does market power exist to a degree that warrants remedies such as price caps, refunds, and so on? ? If so, what is the basis for asserting that market power exists and what is the remedy? (See the discussion in the New York Times article on the ""good hours"" vs. ""bad hours"" approach and the associated political decision not to deal with ""good hours""). ? Can market power be used as leverage to eventually settle generator bills in California at something less than 100 cents on the dollar. (The California ISO filed a complaint claiming $6 billion in overcharges this week.) The QF irony Through the 1990s, QF contracts were projected to be the source of stranded costs because they were priced ""way above market."" In recent months, in California, they look like a bargain (although some are not such great bargains because a portion of their price is tied to gas). You would think that the utilities would request QFs to maximize their output. But credit problems have created an ironical situation. The facts: ? PG&E and Edison have not been paying the QFs fully and promptly for some time. ? The QFs form a creditors committee and threaten to push PG&E and Edison into bankruptcy. (Some gas-fired QFs had to shut down because they did not have money to pay for the gas.) ? Last week's court decision allows MidAmerican/CalEnergy to essentially sell its power to others even though the QF contract ""dedicates"" the output to the purchasing utility. ? CalEnergy does so immediately, selling to El Paso. The Reliant Order A court ordered Reliant to continue to sell to the ISO, when requested, regardless of whether Reliant had been paid fully and promptly for past deliveries to the ISO. Reliant announced it will appeal the order. This is somewhat of a contrast to the QF situation except that the circumstances governing the 2 situations are probably different. The QF contracts pre-date the ISO and are with the utilities and most likely make no reference to providing power during emergencies. In fact, many QF contracts have the opposite provision: authority for the utility to cut takes during so-called ""light load"" periods. Stage 3 emergency and rolling blackouts--again There was another Stage 3 emergency in California ? with rolling blackouts this week. This prompted everyone to wonder why this was happening in March. Among the factors: ? Increased demand from summer-like temperatures ? Cutbacks in imports ? Loss of 1400 MW due to a transformer fire at an Edison plant ? Loss of about 3100 MW from QF plants that were forced to shutdown because they could not afford gas bills (VV) MARKET COMMENTARY (For easier printing of all the articles in this section use the file at the end of the section) Critics Say U.S. Energy Agency Is Weak in Oversight of Utilities By JEFF GERTH and JOSEPH KAHN 03/23/2001 The New York Times Page 1, Column 1 c. 2001 New York Times Company WASHINGTON, March 22 -- The pressure was intense when federal regulators met privately last month to debate remedies for soaring electricity prices in California. Officials of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency whose mandate is to ensure ''just and reasonable'' electricity rates nationwide, had evidence that a few companies had been selling electricity to California at prices far above the cost of generating it. The agency faced an imminent deadline to challenge those prices or let the companies possibly pocket hundreds of millions of dollars in unfair profits. An internal memorandum laid out two choices. The agency could audit and punish ''bad actors,'' the companies that were exploiting the market. Or it could identify ''bad hours,'' when electricity shortages were most acute and spiking prices were arguably nobody's fault, and order refunds for only the most exorbitant prices. ''It may be easier to identify bad hours than bad actors,'' the memorandum said. The commission took the easier way. It decided not to investigate reports of abuses by companies, but issued an order that could require them to refund to the state utilities up to $124 million collected during a relatively few ''bad hours'' in January and February. That is hundreds of millions of dollars less than California might have claimed, since the most potential overcharging occurred during ''good hours,'' when power was more plentiful but prices were often just as extreme. The order ignored those hours. Today, in a criticism of the agency's lack of aggressiveness, California regulators estimated that generators had charged $6.2 billion above competitive levels over 10 months. They urged the agency to dig deeper, hoping it would demand more refunds or other stiff remedies. But the agency's track record -- one of complacency in the eyes of state officials -- leaves California regulators skeptical that Washington will confront the big power producers. The small, obscure agency, tucked behind the rail yard of Union Station here, has largely soft-pedaled its role as the electricity industry's top cop, even though it has wide authority to keep power companies in line. To keep rates reasonable, it can impose price caps, strip companies of the right to charge market rates, force them to return excessive profits and even suspend deregulation altogether. Instead, the agency has largely left it to private companies to pry open the $250 billion electricity industry, which has historically been controlled by monopoly utilities and state officials. The agency's defenders, including its chairman, Curt Hebert Jr., a fierce advocate of unfettered markets, say that its largely hands-off approach reflects the delicate balancing of competing interests -- a commitment to protect consumers while not stifling market forces. But politicians, utility executives, energy economists and local regulators say California's rolling blackouts and skyrocketing electricity prices are the signs of a market running amok. They accuse the agency of standing aside as companies manipulate their way to windfall profits. The agency's critics, who include one of its own commissioners and numerous staff members, say that its enforcement mission has been blunted by free-market passions and the influence of industry insiders in its ranks. When the agency began its first national investigation of high electricity prices last year, it named a newly recruited industry insider, Scott Miller, to lead the effort. Mr. Miller and his colleagues said in their report that there was ''insufficient data'' in California to prove any profiteering by generating companies. Yet his own former employer, PG&E Energy Trading, was at the time a subject of a civil antitrust investigation by the Justice Department that focused on electricity market abuses in New England. The agency has given state regulators a lead role in monitoring local power markets. Yet even as these regulators have urged the agency to be more aggressive in investigating suspicions that companies have abused their power in California, New England, the Midwest and the mid-Atlantic, they have frequently been ignored or rebuffed. Critics say that the agency began deregulation before it was ready or willing to make sure the markets worked effectively. They accuse it of showing favoritism to industry -- allowing companies, for example, to ignore requirements to file detailed reports of market transactions that are critical to proving accusations of market abuses. ''We need to wake up to the fact that this is a dysfunctional market that is being gamed and manipulated by those who participate in it,'' said William Massey, a commissioner of the agency who has become one of its leading critics. The agency's inaction, the critics say, leads to ''gaming'' -- jockeying for profits that does not necessarily involve illegality -- and outright market manipulation. Consumers and utilities are the victims, paying billions of dollars more for electricity than if the markets were truly competitive. Agency officials acknowledge that enforcement of market rules to curb gaming and manipulation had not been a high priority in previous years. But they defended their recent California order as proof that they intend to keep markets free of abuse. They add that the agency is also pressuring two generators to refund almost $11 million for possibly manipulating the California market last spring. Agency officials and some outside analysts say that poorly conceived deregulation plans by states, a shortage of power plants, rising natural gas prices, and even the weather have had more impact on electricity prices than abuses by companies or any failings by the agency. They say the agency must balance the competing interests of generators, local regulators and utility companies if it is to keep deregulation on track. ''We're trying to craft a system that gives breathing room to develop a market, but not so much room that undue market power punishes consumers,'' Mr. Hebert said. Fight Over Deregulation Today's debate traces back to the 1930's, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt backed legislation to break up utility monopolies. The Federal Power Act of 1935 gave the Federal Power Commission a mandate to ensure ''just and reasonable'' electricity rates. The Federal Power Commission was abolished in 1977 and replaced by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, an independent agency with 1,200 employees that also oversees oil pipelines and the natural gas market. The president appoints the chairman and four commissioners -- two Democrats and two Republicans with staggered terms of five years. Two Republican seats are currently unfilled. The deregulation of the electricity markets began in the late 1980's, after the agency had begun opening the gas markets. By 1996, the commissioners issued a landmark order that forced utility companies to open their transmission lines to other utilities and electricity wholesalers. The commission and many private economists expected that by prying open protected markets, electricity prices would immediately fall. That possibility set off a deregulation frenzy, most prominently in California, New York, New England and the mid-Atlantic states. Generating companies rushed to expand in the new, borderless market. But the agency's balancing act has grown more difficult as electricity deregulation has spread nationwide. Congress has forced it to trim its staff in recent years. Officials complain that investigating abuses in electricity markets strains their resources. And as the California crisis has worsened, the commissioners have begun sparring publicly among themselves about what to do. This week, Mr. Massey, a Democratic commissioner, and Mr. Hebert (pronounced AY-bear), a Republican, sat side by side before a House panel and argued diametrically opposed positions. Mr. Hebert said high prices in California ''were sending the right signals to get supply there.'' Mr. Massey called the prices that generators were charging ''unlawful'' and said that his agency, by not reining them in, ''is simply not doing its job.'' The agency's leadership has been in flux for months. Congressional and industry officials in Washington say President Bush is considering replacing Mr. Hebert, whom he named to the top post less than two months ago, with Pat Wood, who runs the Texas public utility commission. A White House spokeswoman had no comment on the reports. Though Mr. Hebert's positions are not far from those of the Bush administration, his relations with California leaders may have made his position tenuous. Mr. Hebert, a Mississippian who is a close ally of the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, has warred with California politicians who have proposed new solutions to the crisis there. Mr. Hebert, who has served as a commissioner since 1997, has often taken the most ideologically free-market position of any commissioner. He flatly rejects the idea of price caps on electricity as hopelessly ineffective and contrary to market forces. When Gov. Gray Davis outlined a plan to have the state buy transmission lines to relieve utility companies' debt, Mr. Hebert's response was dismissive. ''It's not in the interest of the American public,'' he pronounced. Even as new electricity markets opened in the summer of 1999, they started producing nasty shocks. The mid-Atlantic region experienced some early volatility. As the turmoil grew, economists began raising the alarm about a phenomenon called ''market power,'' the ability of energy traders in the new national market to sustain prices above the competitive level. Proving such abuses is difficult, because it requires comparing tens of thousands of separate electricity transactions with the costs of the generators that initiated them. Joseph Bowring, who heads the market monitoring unit of the nonprofit entity that operates the mid-Atlantic transmission system, said that power companies there had exercised some market power. But only the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, not local regulators, had the authority to collect the data to determine how much market power had been exercised and whether it had been abusive or not, he said. Mr. Bowring said he talked to agency officials about doing so. In the end, Mr. Bowring and several agency officials said, the agency chose not to investigate. The decision roiled some agency officials. Ron Rattey, a veteran agency economist, wrote a memorandum last June describing the staff as ''impotent in our ability to monitor, foster, and ensure competitive electric power markets.'' The staff, the memorandum said, did not even enforce a requirement that power companies file detailed quarterly reports listing essentially every sale they make. Such data would have been useful to Mr. Bowring. Local-Federal Clash Local regulators who want to ensure competitive prices often have to act on their own. Monitors in New England have intervened about 600 times since 1999 to correct prices they determined had been caused, at least in part, by market manipulation. The federal agency has sometimes chastised them for interfering too much. The industry, not surprisingly, shares that view. One vocal critic was Mr. Miller. Before the agency recruited him last July to head its division of energy markets, he was director of policy coordination for the national energy-trading unit of PG&E Corporation, the California holding company whose assets also include Pacific Gas and Electric, the California utility. Although the utility has lost billions of dollars during California's crisis, Mr. Miller's former unit has become one of the most profitable new energy traders nationwide. PG&E Energy Trading, by several estimates, is now the second-largest seller of electricity in New England. The company has had a rocky relationship with regulators. They intervened several times in 1999 and 2000 to retroactively cancel auctions they said produced excessive profits for PG&E and other companies. Mr. Miller denounced the practice, though he acknowledged in public testimony that his company sometimes charged ''very high'' prices when it could. ''One person's predatory pricing is another person's competitive advantage,'' Mr. Miller said at a public hearing on deregulation in Texas in 1999. New England regulators too often acted as ''judge, jury and executioner'' when overseeing the market, he said. One year later, Mr. Miller and his new colleagues at the federal agency got a chance to examine New England's problems from the regulators' perspective. Their Nov. 1 report attributed New England's frequent price gyrations to technical and regulatory flaws. As Mr. Miller's team was preparing its report, the Justice Department, whose threshold for stepping into possible industry wrongdoing is far higher than the agency's, began looking into whether price spikes in New England pointed to unlawful monopoly power or collusion, people contacted by the department during that inquiry said. One subject of the civil inquiry is possible price manipulation in one of New England's ancillary services markets, people contacted by the department said. They said the department was examining whether PG&E and two other companies tried to corner that market for several months early last year. PG&E confirmed that the Justice Department had contacted it, but denies wrongdoing and says it has cooperated with the department's requests. Mr. Miller has declined to comment on his role at PG&E or at the agency. His supervisors defended his work and said they had detected no conflict of interest between his work at PG&E and his duties at the agency. Those duties brought Mr. Miller to California last August. With electricity prices there soaring, he and his colleagues sat down with several utility executives at the agency's San Francisco office. One executive, Gary Stern, director of market monitoring for Southern California Edison, wanted the agency to stop what he suspected were market abuses by power generators. He provided a road map to help investigators figure out how power companies traded power contracts -- and whether they had manipulated the markets. But when Mr. Miller and his team approached 11 generators and marketers -- including his old employer -- a few weeks later, they did it their way. They asked eight questions, many of them imprecise, like: ''Describe your strategy for bidding generation resources into market.'' This question, Mr. Stern said in a recent interview, ''was equivalent to asking a suspected burglar how he spent his day.'' Some agency officials also thought the team should probe deeper. Mr. Rattey recommended that Mr. Miller seek the quarterly pricing reports that marketers were supposed to file. But his suggestion was not adopted, agency records show. Daniel Larcamp, Mr. Miller's supervisor, said ''there might have been more information that could have been obtained'' in the California inquiry. But he said the commission gave the staff only three months to finish, making it impossible to collect and analyze the reams of data involved. For Mr. Miller, agency documents show, the investigation was so time-consuming that he had no time to fill out the financial disclosure form required of new federal employees. Mr. Miller submitted his form in late January, after a reporter requested it. Agency lawyers approved the form, but only after he provided additional information about his job and compensation from PG&E. The lawyers said Mr. Miller's participation had been permissible because PG&E was not the subject of the investigation. When the staff report was issued on Nov. 1, it found high prices and problems in the design of the California market. But while the companies ''had the potential to exercise market power,'' the commission said, there was ''insufficient data'' to prove that they did. Some marketers saw the report as an exoneration. ''This has been looked at several times, most notably by the FERC and nobody has found any evidence of market manipulation and profiteering,'' Rob Doty, the chief financial officer of Dynegy Inc., told a reporter earlier this year. California Inquiry The agency has recently shown signs of wanting to apply pressure on generators. But its early efforts show how it is treading on new and uncertain turf. When the California crisis grew severe last December, the commission issued a refund order, a shot across the bow for generators charging high prices. It required them to submit detailed data any time they sold electricity in California for more than $150 per megawatt hour, considered at the time a fair estimate of the highest costs any of them faced. It also told generators that for the next several months, they could be forced to give refunds if the agency found that they had charged excessive prices. The commission also said that it would examine bidding practices and strategies for withholding generating capacity to ferret out any efforts to artificially raise prices. When the agency's own 60-day deadline for examining market data in January approached, however, it became clear that staff members had not made any detailed examination. Instead, staff members said, the agency scrambled to forge a last-minute compromise that would allow it to issue a statement opposing high prices in the state without a time-consuming investigation. During this scramble, a senior staff member, Kevin Kelly, suggested focusing on bad hours instead of bad actors. ''Our attempts to find illegal behavior or legal 'misbehavior' by sellers ('bad actors') always seems to fail,'' his memorandum said. It said that the agency could more easily blame high prices on acute shortages during the most critical hours. The suggestion won the day. The commission decided to limit its order to the hours when California declared a Stage 3 emergency, when supplies are critically low. Mr. Stern of Southern California Edison and several private-sector economists have attacked the economic logic of that order. They said that the commission has focused on times when prices might be legitimately high. The bigger worry: Generators can and often do sustain artificially high prices when supplies are not as tight, they say. Mr. Massey, the Democratic commissioner, dissented from the decision for those reasons. Because most high-priced transactions in January and February did not occur during bad hours, he argued, the commission effectively chose to bless as ''just and reasonable'' the hefty profits generators are making from the California crisis. ''The problem with my agency is that we're so carried away with the rhetoric of markets that we've gotten sloppy,'' Mr. Massey said. ''We're talking about electricity. It's the juice of the economy, so it's got to be available and reasonably priced.'' Williams defends pricing of electricity 03/23/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. TULSA, Okla. (AP) - Williams Cos. Inc. says it can justify the rates it charged for wholesale power, despite accusations from federal regulators that it sold over-priced electricity to California. Federal regulators claim Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co., a unit of Tulsa-based Williams, owes California more than $40 million in refunds for power it sold to the state's Independent System Operator. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission says that Williams is one of several power providers responsible for $124 million in overcharges from transactions in January and February. The Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power grid, claims the state was overcharged $6.2 billion by 21 wholesale power providers, including Williams, between May and February. Williams says the rates it charged California were fair and were based on production costs and market conditions. ""Williams is confident that it performed within the guidelines established by the ISO,"" said Williams spokeswoman Paula Hall Collins. ""We felt like we had worked within the regulations set up by ISO."" According to the commission, power prices levied by Williams in January and February exceeded federal price ceilings based on the cost of natural gas and other market conditions. However, the price ceilings were established after the ISO accepted Williams' power prices, Collins said. The commission will review Williams' explanation and either accept the justification or order the company to pay refunds. Allegheny Energy makes big California connection 03/23/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. HAGERSTOWN, Md. (AP) - Allegheny Energy Inc. said Thursday it has agreed to sell $4.5 billion worth of power to California's electricity-purchasing agency over the next 10 years. The company said the contract call for Allegheny to provide up to 1,000 megawatts that the Hagerstown-based company has secured from western generating plants through its new energy trading division, Allegheny Energy Global Markets - formerly Merrill Lynch Global Energy Markets. ""This is a win-win for both the state of California and Allegheny Energy. It provides a long-term source of fixed-price energy and should help to stabilize prices in California,"" said Michael P. Morrell, president of the Allegheny Energy Supply division. Allegheny Energy is the parent of Allegheny Power, which delivers electric energy and natural gas to parts of Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia. Williams plans expansion of pipeline to help power Calif. 03/23/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - The Williams Cos. plans to expands its Kern River pipeline, which runs through Utah, to provide more natural gas for generating plants in California. Williams' gas pipeline unit in Salt Lake City said Thursday that it plans to construct nearly 700 miles of additional pipeline that will run parallel to its existing Kern River line. Construction on the $1 billion project is expected to begin next year and is scheduled for completion in May 2003, said Kirk Morgan, director of business development for Kern River pipeline. ""Shippers are seeking more access to natural gas from the Rocky Mountain basin, where producers are aggressively stepping up production,"" Morgan said. The new pipeline is expected to deliver about 900 million cubic feet of natural gas per day to markets in Utah, Nevada and California. Most of the gas will be used for generating plants planned in California. If all of the pipeline's capacity were used to generate electricity, it could produce about 5,400 megawatts. ""That is enough to light around 4.5 million homes,"" Morgan said. The original Kern River line was completed in 1992. It enters Utah from Wyoming then crosses into the Salt Lake Valley near Bountiful. It turns south near the Salt Lake City International Airport then runs the length of the state before passing into southern Nevada and winding up near Bakersfield, Calif. It currently transports 700 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. Williams, based in Tulsa, Okla., recently filed an emergency application with federal regulators to install additional pumping stations on the line to increase its capacity by 135 million cubic feet per day. That $81 million pumping station project should be completed by July 1. During the 2002 construction period, the Kern River project will employ between 1,500 and 1,800 people. The company estimates annual property taxes it pays to Utah counties will increase from $3.5 million to about $7 million. Questar will be one of the customers on the new pipeline, Morgan said. The utility wants to supply additional gas to southern Utah cities, including St. George and Cedar City. ""Our own pipelines serving southern Utah are at full capacity so this is an opportunity to transport additional gas into those areas from company-owned supplies in Wyoming,"" said Questar Gas spokeswoman Audra Sorensen. Calif Energy Commission OKs 3 Pwr Plants Worth 2,076 MW 03/23/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) (This article was originally published Thursday) LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California Energy Commission Wednesday approved three power plants worth 2,076 megawatts, two of which are scheduled to come on line by the end of 2002, a CEC spokesman said Thursday. The plants approved include BP Amoco PLC (BP) unit ARCO Western Energy's 500 megawatt Western Midway Sunset Project, slated to come on line in October 2002; Caithness Energy's 520 MW Blythe Power Plant, to come on line by Dec. 31, 2002; and Thermo Ecotek's 1,056 MW Mountainview Power Plant, scheduled to come on line in April 2003. All three of the new plants will be natural gas-fired combined-cycle plants. The $550 million Mountainview plant will be located in Southern California, near San Bernadino. The $300 million Western Midway-Sunset plant will be located in central Kern County, while the $250 million Blythe plant will be located in the city of Blythe in Riverside County. The latest approvals bring to 13 the total number of plants approved since April 1999 by the CEC, a spokesman said. Those plants will supply 8,405 MW to the state, which has seen rolling blackouts and spiking wholesale power prices in the last six months, in part due to lack of supply. -By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872; jessica.berthold@dowjones.com Some CalEnergy Power Could Be Sold Outside Calif - CEO 03/23/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) (This article was originally published Thursday) LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Some of CalEnergy Operating Corp's power could end up being sold outside of California, though that is not the company's intent, CalEnergy Chairman and CEO David Sokol said in a conference call Thursday. CalEnergy, an affiliate of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co, which is majority owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire-Hathaway (BRKA), was given legal authority Thursday to suspend 270 megawatts of power delivery to Edison International (EIX) utility Southern California Edison and sell on the open market, because SoCal Edison has not paid its bills since November. CalEnergy stopped supplying power to SoCal Ed immediately following the court ruling. ""We stopped supplying power at 1 PM (PST) and have been selling to parties that will pay since then....We are selling it to marketers; our current marketing agent is El Paso Corp (EPG) and they will sell it for us,"" Sokol said. Sokol added that while it was his company's intention to have its power sold to California, that could not be guaranteed. ""We leave the energy selling to El Paso....We've directed them that we would like the power to stay in California but we can't stop them,"" from selling out of state, Sokol said. Wholesale prices on the open market are about $400-$500 a megawatt-hour, three times more than what the company had received under its contract with SoCal Ed. The court's ruling did not address the $45 million SoCal Ed still owes CalEnergy for November and December power, and Sokol said that his company's separate lawsuit on that matter sought to attach the utility's assets as payment for that debt. Sokol said the court's ruling had ""significant implications"" for the entire community of small, independent generators, known as qualifying facilities or QFs, who have not received payment from SoCal Ed. ""Edison's own lawyer said it best....that every QF in the state will begin to mitigate if the judge allowed us (to sell on the open market),"" Sokol said. Sokol said his company was prepared to push SoCal Ed into involuntary bankruptcy Friday if CalEnergy hadn't won the case, but said he couldn't speculate whether other QFs may be more or less inclined to do so as a result of the court outcome. A group of renewable power suppliers, owed more than $100 million from SoCal Ed, said late Wednesday they want state lawmakers to release them for their supply contracts with PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric and SoCal Ed until the utilities are restored to financial stability. The utilities claim close to $13 billion in undercollections due to an inability to pass high wholesale power costs to customers under a rate freeze. In a statement, SoCal Ed said it opposed CalEnergy's bid to suspend its QF contract because the utility believed Gov. Gray Davis and state regulators are close to resolving ""very legitimate financial concerns of CalEnergy and other QF suppliers."" SoCal Ed said it was concerned that CalEnergy's request to sell to third parties would lead to a major supply shortage in California. The utility said it has informed the QFs that it is working to resolve the issue without giving unfair advantage to one class of creditors. While many of the state's large power suppliers have been paid by on a forward basis for the power they sell into California, the QFs, which make up one-third of the state's total power supply, haven't been paid by SoCal Ed since November. PG&E has made partial payments to its QFs. -By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872, jessica.berthold@dowjones.com (Jason Leopold contributed to this article.) California and the West Judge Frees Small Firm From Edison Contract KEN ELLINGWOOD; DAN MORAIN TIMES STAFF WRITERS 03/23/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition A-3 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company El CENTRO -- California's balance of electrical power shifted slightly Thursday when an Imperial County judge temporarily freed a small geothermal energy producer from its contract with Southern California Edison, allowing it to sell power on the open market. The ruling by Superior Court Judge Donal B. Donnelly could lead to a mass exodus by hundreds of small energy producers that have been selling power to the state's financially troubled utilities for months without getting paid. At the same time, it may have staved off plans by a group of the small generators to send Edison into involuntary bankruptcy as early as today. In Sacramento, energy legislation pushed by Gov. Gray Davis passed in the state Senate but foundered in the Assembly. The measure was intended to ensure that the state gets repaid for the electricity that it has been buying on behalf of Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric, which say they lack the cash and credit to purchase power. The bill also was supposed to guarantee that the small, alternative energy producers--which together provide nearly a third of the state's power--get paid. But Assembly Republicans opposed it, saying it hadn't been given sufficient scrutiny. The impact of the small producers was made clear in Imperial County, where Edison's failure to pay CalEnergy, the county's biggest property taxpayer, had outsize implications. CalEnergy had put county officials on notice that it was about to miss a $3.8-million property tax payment. The uncertainty had prompted the tiny Calipatria Unified School District to postpone a bond issue for badly needed school repairs. Among CalEnergy Chairman David Sokol's first acts after the judge's ruling Thursday was to promise Imperial County Supervisor Wally J. Leimgruber that the company would pay its property taxes on time. ""That is great news,"" Leimgruber said. Within hours of its court victory, CalEnergy had stopped transmitting geothermal power to Edison and begun selling it to El Paso Energy, a marketing company that purchased the energy at prevailing rates and resold it on the spot market. Some of the more than 700 other small energy producers in the state said they were considering similar action against Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric. ""We absolutely need the right to sell to third parties,"" said Dean Vanech, president of Delta Power, a New Jersey company that owns five small gas-fired plants in California and is owed tens of millions of dollars by Edison. Sokol praised the Imperial County judge and said his company simply wanted the authority to sell its power ""to a credit-worthy company that, in fact, pays for the power."" An Edison spokesman said the company was disappointed with the ruling, but sympathized with CalEnergy and other small producers because ""California's power crisis has placed [them] in financial distress, just as it has placed utilities in financial distress."" Edison expressed concern that the ruling would prompt CalEnergy and other small producers to sell their power out of state. Sokol said CalEnergy had specifically told El Paso Energy that it hoped its power would remain in California, ""but if someone wants to pay a higher price out of state, we can't stop them."" Sokol said that Edison still owes CalEnergy $140 million and that the company--along with seven other small producers--had been prepared to file a petition in federal bankruptcy court in Los Angeles today forcing the utility into involuntary bankruptcy. He said his company no longer intends to do so, and he believed--but wasn't certain--that the other companies would shelve their plans. Edison filed papers Thursday with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission showing that it owed $840 million to various small electricity producers, many of which rely on renewable energy sources such as geothermal steam, solar energy or wind. The alternative energy producers--and utilities--strenuously objected to the legislation considered in Sacramento on Thursday. The bill, spelling out how the utilities are to pay the state and the small producers, passed the Senate on a 27-9 vote, the exact two-thirds margin required. But it stalled in the Assembly on a 46-23 party-line vote, well short of two-thirds. ""When I was a citizen back in Lancaster, I heard these stories about pieces of legislation that were cooked up late at night, that . . . were cut and pasted together and were rammed through by the Legislature,"" Assemblyman George Runner (R-Lancaster) said. ""That's exactly what we have before us."" The alternative electricity generators, including oil companies, warned that they would lose money under the Davis proposal, while representatives of Edison and PG&E, which have amassed billions in debt in the worsening energy crisis, said the legislation would push them deeper into the hole. ""There isn't enough money,"" Edison attorney Ann Cohn testified at a Senate hearing on the bill Thursday. ""It is a very simple question: Dollars going out cannot be greater than dollars coming in."" The bill, AB 8X, combined several proposals. First, it sought to clarify earlier legislation by spelling out that Edison and PG&E must pay the state all money collected from consumers for electricity that the state has been buying. Additionally, the bill would turn over to the California Public Utilities Commission the thorny issue of how much to pay alternative energy producers for their electricity. Wind, solar and geothermal producers might agree to the prices offered by the administration. But most of the alternative energy producers, including Chevron and British Petroleum, use natural gas to generate electricity through ""cogeneration,"" a process of creating steam for both electric generation and heat. With natural gas prices high, they contend, they would lose money at the prices Davis is offering. * Ellingwood reported from El Centro, Morain from Sacramento. Times staff writers Mitchell Landsberg in Los Angeles and Jenifer Warren, Nancy Vogel and Carl Ingram in Sacramento contributed to this story. (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Power Points Background The state Legislature approved electricity deregulation with a unanimous vote in 1996. The move was expected to lower power bills in California by opening up the energy market to competition. Relatively few companies, however, entered that market to sell electricity, giving each that did considerable influence over the price. Meanwhile, demand has increased in recent years while no major power plants have been built. These factors combined last year to push up the wholesale cost of electricity. But the state's biggest utilities--Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison--are barred from increasing consumer rates. So the utilities have accumulated billions of dollars in debt and, despite help from the state, have struggled to buy enough electricity. * Daily Developments * Overcharges by major electricity suppliers were estimated at $6.3 billion, up from the $5.5 billion first thought, California's power grid operator said. * Electricity producers denied that they have profiteered and argued that Cal-ISO's figures don't take into account all their costs. * A Superior Court judge's ruling Thursday freeing a small producer from its contract with Edison could lead to a mass exodus by small energy producers that have been selling to the utilities without getting paid. * Verbatim ""If these guys have such high costs ... how come they're making so much money?"" --Gary Stern, Edison's director of market monitoring and analysis, referring to power producers Complete package and updates at www.latimes.com/power Grid Operator Says California Paid Too Much for Power By Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal 03/23/2001 The Wall Street Journal A2 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) California's electric-grid operator said power suppliers may have overcharged the state and its utilities by $6.2 billion, or a total of 30%, in a 10-month period, and has asked federal regulators to step up their policing of electricity markets. Meanwhile, a California state judge handed down a decision involving small power producers that could result in more electricity being made available in the energy-starved state, but likely at greater cost to the state government. The $6.2 billion figure was contained in a market analysis by the California Independent System Operator filed yesterday with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The ISO says it isn't seeking a refund -- for the May through February period -- because its analysis lacked important market data. For example, it estimated costs for 21 suppliers based on published prices for natural gas, not on specific data showing what each generator actually paid for the fuel. ""We don't know how much gas actually was purchased at spot-market prices,"" said Anjali Sheffrin, the ISO's head of market analysis. Charles Robinson, general counsel for the ISO, said FERC needs to become ""more aggressive about market-power mitigation."" The ISO's filing, he said, was intended to push the agency in that direction, since FERC is responsible for policing deregulated electricity and natural-gas markets. He said that if the FERC doesn't act, the state of California may find ways to discipline the market, such as through the state attorney general's office. The attorney general has been investigating the state's electricity market for many months but hasn't brought any court action. Dynegy Inc., a big owner of power plants in California, said it will provide additional information to FERC supporting its position that the prices it has charged for power have been ""just and reasonable."" The Houston company was one of 13 energy suppliers that the FERC this month ordered to pay refunds totaling $124 million or ""show cause"" why it should be excused. Dynegy said the FERC analysis was flawed, because it used ""inaccurate"" prices for natural gas and pollution credits. While big power producers such as Dynegy came under attack, small power producers won a potentially significant victory in a state court in Southern California's Imperial County. A judge granted 10 geothermal plants operated by the CalEnergy Co. unit of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co., a unit of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., of Omaha, Neb., permission to suspend deliveries of electricity to Southern California Edison Co. and instead seek other buyers. These plants, known as ""qualifying facilities,"" are under long-term contract to Edison and other utilities but haven't been paid for months. Edison, a unit of Edison International, of Rosemead, Calif., says it has been unable to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in power bills to CalEnergy and others because it has been driven to the brink of insolvency by the state's failed utility-deregulation plan. While the CalEnergy case involves only about 320 megawatts of power, the repercussions could be far greater. Collectively, hundreds of qualifying facilities, or QFs, produce as much as 30% of California's electricity needs. QFs totaling 3,000 megawatts cut their production in recent weeks for lack of payment. This loss of output was a significant cause of the blackouts that hit California this week. Observers believe the CalEnergy court decision could give other QFs an opportunity to sell power in the open market, presumably to the state government that now is California's biggest energy buyer. An hour after the court decision yesterday, some 400 megawatts of power came back into the market, the ISO said. However, additional QF power sales on the open market could substantially increase the state's tab. Already, the state has allocated more than $4 billion for electricity purchases. Separately, Edison said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that its unpaid power bills could contribute to a write-off of as much as $2.7 billion for 2000. Because of uncertainty caused by the energy crisis, the company hasn't yet reported year-end earnings. Power regulators debate who should be exempted from blackouts By KAREN GAUDETTE Associated Press Writer 03/22/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - State power regulators said Thursday they are working to exempt all California hospitals, regardless of size, from rolling blackouts. The Public Utilities Commission met with representatives from hospitals and investor-owned utilities after Los Angeles lawyer David Huard filed an emergency motion with the PUC on behalf of more than 500 hospitals throughout the state. Under PUC rules, hospitals with more than 100 beds are exempt from losing electricity during power emergencies. But during rolling blackouts Monday, at least a dozen hospitals from Long Beach to Clearlake were forced to use their backup generators. Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison Co. say they blacked out those hospitals specifically because they have backup generators. Both utilities said the temporary blackouts were part of their overall efforts to spread the burden of blackouts over more of their customers. Linda Ziegler, director of business and regulatory planning for SoCal Edison, said the utility is following state law and will implement new guidelines if the PUC changes them. But hospitals say there is a 10-second lapse before emergency generators kick in, which could harm patients in the midst of delicate surgical procedures such as organ transplants or brain surgery. ""You wouldn't fly a plane with only your emergency backup systems in place,"" said Ann Mosher, a spokeswoman for California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco. ""Backup generators are just that, they're not designed to keep the hospital up and running at full capacity."" Ziegler said that power still goes out for reasons beyond the energy crisis, from incidents like lightning or a knocked-down power pole. ""If it's a serious problem for the hospital it's certainly something they should be address just from an ongoing basis,"" she said. The exemption would cover all hospitals within the territory of the state's investor owned utilities PG&E, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric. Hospitals within the range of municipally owned utilities, such as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, are separately regulated. For more than two decades, prisons, hospitals with more than 100 beds and emergency services such as fire and police departments have been classified as ""essential"" services, and are exempted from blackouts by order of state power regulators. After rolling blackouts began darkening the state in January, many other public service groups began seeking relief from power interruptions, including transit systems, schools and water districts. --- On the Net: http://www.cpuc.ca.gov Federal Judge Orders Reliant To Keep Selling Pwr To Calif 03/22/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP)--A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction Wednesday ordering a major electricity wholesaler to continue selling to California despite its fear that it will not get paid. U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. said Californians were at risk of irreparable harm if Reliant Energy (REI) stopped selling power to the Independent System Operator, which oversees the state's power grid. The ISO buys last-minute power on behalf of utilities to fill gaps in supply. Damrell dismissed Reliant's attempt to force the state Department of Water Resources to back the ISO's purchases for the state's two biggest utilities. The state has been spending about $50 million a day on power for Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, both denied credit by suppliers after amassing billions of dollars in debts. The judge said he had no authority to force the DWR to pay for that power. Gov. Gray Davis has said the state isn't responsible for purchasing the costly last-minute power ISO buys for Edison and PG&E, despite a law authorizing state power purchases on the utilities' behalf. ISO attorney Charles Robinson said the ruling gives ISO operators ""a tool to assist them in keeping the lights on in California."" ""Had the decision gone the other way, one could expect other generators to simply ignore emergency orders,"" Robinson said. Damrell's preliminary injunction will remain in effect until the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rules on the matter. Damrell denied the ISO's request for preliminary injunctions against three other wholesalers - Dynegy Inc. (DYN), AES Corp. (AES) and Williams Cos. (WMB) - which agreed to continue selling to the ISO pending the FERC ruling. Spokesmen for Reliant, Dynegy, AES and Williams were out of the office Wednesday night and didn't immediately return calls from The Associated Press seeking comment on the ruling. The ISO went to court in February after a federal emergency order requiring the power sales expired. The judge then issued a temporary restraining order, requiring the sales, but dropped it after the suppliers agreed to continue sales to California pending his Wednesday ruling. The ISO said it would lose about 3,600 megawatts if the suppliers pulled out, enough power for about 2.7 million households. One megawatt is enough for roughly 750 homes. Grid officials said Reliant's share alone is about 3,000 megawatts. Reliant said the amount at issue actually is less than a fourth of that, because most of its output is already committed under long-term contracts. Reliant, which currently provides about 9% of the state's power, worries it won't get paid due to the financial troubles of PG&E and Edison. PG&E and Edison say that together they have lost about $13 billion since June due to soaring wholesale electricity costs that California's 1996 deregulation law bars them from passing onto customers. Calif Small Pwr Producers To Shut Plants If Rates Capped By Jason Leopold Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 03/22/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Many of California's independent power producers late Wednesday threatened to take their small power plants offline this week if state lawmakers pass legislation that would cap the rates the generators charge for electricity they sell directly to the state's three investor-owned utilities. At issue is a bill that would repeal a section of the state's Public Utilities Code, which links the 688 so-called qualifying facilities' electricity rates to the monthly border price of natural gas. Lawmakers, however, are poised to pass the legislation. State regulators are then expected to approve a measure that would restructure the fluctuating rates the QFs charge PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric, Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison, and Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric from $170 a megawatt-hour to $69-$79/MWh, regardless of the price of natural gas. Whereas each of the 688 QF contracts differed, largely because natural gas prices are higher in Southern California than Northern California, the state wants the QFs to sign a general contract with the utilities. The cogeneration facilities, which produce about 5,400 megawatts of electricity in the state, said the rates are too low and they won't sign new supply contracts with the utilities. ""For $79/MWh, natural gas would have to be $6 per million British thermal unit at the Southern California border,"" said Tom Lu, executive director of Carson-based Watson Cogeneration Company, the state's largest QF, generating 340 MW. ""Our current gas price at the border is $12.50."" Other gas-fired QFs said the state could face another round of rolling blackouts if lawmakers and state regulators pass the legislation, which is expected to be heard on the Senate floor Thursday, and allow it to be implemented by Public Utilities Commission next week. Lu, whose company is half-owned by BP Amoco PLC (BP) and is owed $100 million by SoCal Ed, said the proposals by the PUC and the Legislature ""will only make things worse."" David Fogarty, spokesman for Western States Petroleum Association, whose members supply California with more than 2,000 MW, said the utilities need to pay the QFs more than $1 billion for electricity that was already produced. State Loses 3,000 MW QF Output Due Of Financial Reasons The QFs represent about one-third, or 9,700 MW, of the state's total power supply. Roughly 5,400 MW are produced by natural gas-fired facilities. The rest is generated by wind, solar power and biomass. About 3,000 MW of gas-fired and renewable QF generation is offline in California because the power plant owners haven't been paid hundreds of millions of dollars from cash-strapped utilities SoCal Ed and PG&E for nearly four months. Several small power plant owners owed money by SoCal Ed have threatened to drag the utility into involuntary bankruptcy if the utility continues to default on payments and fails to agree to supply contracts at higher rates. The defaults have left many of the renewable and gas-fired QFs unable to operate their power plants because they can't afford to pay for the natural gas to run their units. Others continue to produce electricity under their contracts with the state's utilities but aren't being paid even on a forward basis. The California Independent System Operator, keeper of the state's electricity grid, said the loss of the QF generation was the primary reason rolling blackouts swept through the state Monday and Tuesday. Gov. Gray Davis, recognizing the potential disaster if additional QFs took their units offline, held marathon meetings with key lawmakers Monday and Tuesday to try and hammer out an agreement that would get the QFs paid on a forward basis and set rates of $79/MWh and $69/MWh for five and 10 year contracts. He also said he would direct the PUC to order the utilities to pay the QFs for power they sell going forward. ""After next week the QF problem will be behind us,"" Davis said Tuesday. ""We want to get the QFs paid...the QFs are dropping like flies...and when that happens the lights go out."" But this just makes the problem worse, said Assemblyman Dean Florez, D-Shafter, a member of the Assembly energy committee. ""I don't know how we are going to keep the lights on,"" Florez said in an interview. ""Many of these congenerators are in my district. They said if the legislation doesn't change they are going offline. This compounds the issue of rolling blackouts, especially now when we need every megawatt."" Davis, who didn't meet with people representing the QFs, said he was handing the QF issue to the PUC because lawmakers failed to pass legislation that would have set a five-year price for natural gas and allow the QFs to sign individual contracts with the utilities. In addition, SOCal Ed opposed the legislation, saying the rates should be below $50/MWh. Some renewable power producers said they aren't vehemently opposed to the new rate structure because it guarantees them a higher rate than what was originally proposed. QFs Want Third Party Supply Contracts John Wood, who represents the SoCal Ed Gas Fired Creditors Committee, one of a handful of groups that have formed since January to explore options on getting paid by the utilities, said his group of gas-fired QF creditors want to be released from their supply contracts and sell to third parties. ""Under our plan, we would be permitted to sell electricity to third parties (including the state Department of Water Resources) until a resolution to the crisis can be accomplished,"" wood said. Hal Dittmer, president of Sacramento-based Wellhead Electric in Sacramento, which is owed $8 million by PG&E, has 85 MW of gas-fired generation units offline. Under the state's plan, Dittmer said he risks going out of business. ""I can't buy natural gas for what I would be paid under this decision,"" he said. ""The state needs to quit kidding themselves that they don't need to raise electricity rates. All of this is being driven by an artificial construct that California can avoid raising rates."" -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; jason.leopold@dowjones.com Power Strain Eases but Concerns Mount Energy: Officials say summer prices will be high, and a state report shows that contracts with generators are far short of goals. DAN MORAIN; JENIFER WARREN TIMES STAFF WRITERS 03/22/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition A-3 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO -- California's fragile electricity system stabilized Wednesday, but a Davis administration report suggested troubles ahead because the state could be forced to buy most of its power for the coming summer on the costly and volatile spot market. After two days of statewide blackouts, power plants that had been shut down were cranked up. Unseasonable heat tapered off. The operators of the statewide power grid relaxed their state of emergency. But plenty of ominous signs remained. Many small producers remained shut down, skeptical about Gov. Gray Davis' plan for utilities to pay them. State Controller Kathleen Connell issued a sharp warning about the high cost of the state's foray into the power business and announced that she will block an administration request that she transfer $5.6 billion into an account that could be tapped to pay for state purchases of electricity. And a report from the administration summarizing contracts between Davis and independent power generators showed that the state has signed contracts for only 2,247 megawatts of electricity, significantly less than the 6,000 to 7,000 megawatts previously claimed. While there are agreements in principle for the full amount, the report notes that generators can back out of the contracts for a variety of reasons, including the state's failure to sell bonds to finance power purchased by July 1. The Legislature has approved plans to sell $10 billion in bonds, but none have yet been issued. ""We are exposed enormously this summer,"" Senate Energy Committee chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) said after looking at the report. ""We owe the people the truth about how difficult this summer is going to be. We don't have a power fairy."" Perhaps most significant, the report suggests that the contracts fall significantly short of Davis' stated goal of buying no more than 5% of the state's summer needs on the spot electricity market, where prices can be many times those of long-term contracts. After reading the report, Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who studies the California electricity market, said the numbers suggested that the state's long-term contracts will cover less than half of what the state will need this summer. ""We're definitely short this summer, next summer and the summer of 2003,"" he said. California was forced to start buying electricity in December--at a cost of $50 million a day--because producers refused to sell to Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric. The two utilities amassed billions of dollars in debt when prices for wholesale power soared on the spot market. Vikram Budhraja, a consultant retained by Davis to negotiate deals with generators, said the report represents a ""work in progress."" He said the state may yet sign new contracts. However, Wolak said the contract figures confirm what he and others have been dreading: that summer is going to be rife with rolling blackouts unless serious steps to cut demand are taken immediately. Wolak and other experts say large industrial customers must be switched to real-time meters and pricing to persuade them to use the bulk of their energy at times of low demand. The head of the Energy Foundation, a San Francisco-based nonprofit that promotes sustainable sources of power, made the same proposal to Davis on Wednesday. ""The government need not ask customers to swelter in the dark this summer,"" foundation President Hal Harvey argued in a letter. He also proposed a crash campaign to boost sales of efficient appliances and lightbulbs. He said the state needs to take over the utilities' contracts with alternative energy providers to ensure they stay in business, and sign new contracts for 1,500 megawatts of new wind power--the cheapest, fastest and cleanest source of new supply. Davis had proposed a formula Tuesday to force private utilities to pay the alternative producers, some of which have not been paid since November. But some of them warned Wednesday that Davis' plan offers them little incentive to turn on their generators. Alternative energy producers supply more than a quarter of the electricity consumed in California. Many producers generate electricity from wind, sun and geothermal sources. But most of them generate power using natural gas--and the cost of natural gas has been soaring. Several natural gas users said Davis' plan, which caps rates, won't cover their fuel costs. Davis assumes that the price of natural gas will fall. But small generators say they don't have sufficient purchasing power or sophistication to gamble on future prices. The Public Utilities Commission is expected to approve Davis' proposal next week. It offers producers two choices: 7.9 cents a kilowatt-hour if they agree to supply power for five years, or 6.9 cents a kilowatt-hour over 10 years. ""The price of natural gas is higher than that,"" said Marty Quinn, executive vice president and chief operating officer of Ridgewood Power LLC, which owns three natural gas-fired co-generation plants. ""If we operate, we'll lose money."" Ridgewood is not operating, having been cut off by gas suppliers. The company sued PG&E last month seeking overdue payments and release from its contracts with the utility. A hearing is scheduled in El Centro today in another lawsuit filed by a small energy producer, an Imperial Valley geothermal producer that sued Edison for refusing to let it break its contract and sell on the open market. CalEnergy says Edison owes it about $140 million for energy sold since November. A company spokesman, Jay Lawrence, said CalEnergy was going ahead with its suit despite Davis' proposal. ""We've had promises before,"" he said. In other developments: * A federal judge in Sacramento on Wednesday ordered Reliant Energy of Houston, a major producer, to continue selling power to California during emergencies, despite the company's argument that it may not be fully reimbursed. The order will remain in effect for 60 days or until the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decides a related case. * Connell said the state budget surplus has shrunk to $3.2 billion because the state has spent roughly $2.8 billion on electricity. She criticized the administration for withholding basic information about state finances, and said she will begin an audit on Monday of the Department of Water Resources, which is responsible for purchasing power. Davis' aides said Connell took her action because the Democratic governor endorsed one of Connell's foes this week in the race for Los Angeles mayor, former Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa.

Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey), Senate Energy Committee chairwoman CPUC Must Address Rates In QF Repayment Order - SoCal Ed 03/21/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Any order from the California Public Utilities Commission requiring utilities to pay small, independent generators going forward must determine how that could be done within the existing rate structure, a spokesman for Edison International (EIX) utility Southern California Edison said Wednesday. The utility was responding to a PUC proposed decision that would require utilities to pay small generators, called qualifying facilities, $79 a megawatt hour within 15 days of electricity delivery. The decision will be voted March 27 by the CPUC. ""We're still reviewing (the decision) and should have more to say in a day or two. To the extent that the commission orders us to pay going forward of course we will. But it needs to address how we will pay the QFs,"" a SoCal Edison spokesman said. SoCal Edison and PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric Co. are struggling under nearly $13 billion in uncollected power costs due to an inability to pass high wholesale power costs to customers under a rate freeze. Gov. Gray Davis Tuesday blasted the utilities for not having paid their QF bills in full since December. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. has made some partial payments to QFs, but SoCal Edison has paid nothing. Together, they owe the QFs about $1 billion, but the order doesn't address that debt. An Edison executive said, in reaction to the governor's sharp comments, that the company simply doesn't have the money to pay creditors. ""The root problem here is there just isn't enough money in the current rate base to pay our bills,"" said Edison Senior Vice President of Public Affairs Bob Foster. ""We understand the financial distress (the QFs) face; we are facing financial distress ourselves."" The proposed PUC order would also require the state's investor-owned utilities to offer the small generators five- and 10-year contracts for power for $79/MWh and $69/MWh, respectively. The QFs ""may be able to live with"" the PUC proposal, but the five- and 10-year contract prices may be inadequate if natural gas prices at one of the California borders are high, said Jan Smutny-Jones, president of the Independent Energy Producers Association. Natural gas prices into California are currently higher than anywhere in the country. But some say the proposed decision may not be enough to prevent the QFs from filing involuntary bankruptcy proceedings against the utilities for the money they are still owed. ""There's still a lot of skepticism. To say our position has changed based on the CPUC decision or the governor's announcement is not accurate. A lot still has to happen,"" said Jay Lawrence, a spokesman for a renewable creditors committee. -By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872; jessica.berthold@dowjones.com -0- 22/03/01 01-27G State Says It's Accelerating Plan to Buy Power Utilities' Grid Government: Talks with Edison are reported near completion, but agreement with heavily indebted PG&E has a way to go. RONE TEMPEST; DAN MORAIN TIMES STAFF WRITERS 03/21/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition A-22 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO -- As blackouts hit California for a second day Tuesday, a key consultant to Gov. Gray Davis said negotiations to buy the power grid owned by the state's largest utilities ""are proceeding at an accelerated pace."" Wall Street consultant Joseph Fichera said talks with Southern California Edison could be wrapped up within days, although those with PG&E are much less advanced. The administration and PG&E have not reached even an agreement in principle, he said. PG&E, which has more debt than Edison, says its transmission lines are more extensive than those of its Southern California counterpart. The state wants to buy the utilities' transmission lines and other assets for about $7 billion to provide cash to the utilities, help stabilize the electricity supply and ease the power crunch that has plagued California for months. To research the grid purchase, Fichera said, the state has had to pore over 80,000 documents just to assess the utilities' liabilities. ""We are working at a good pace,"" said Fichera, chief executive of the New York firm Saber Partners. "" . . . If we get to a deal-breaker, it might be longer."" By making Fichera, who is also a consultant to the Texas Public Utilities Commission, available to reporters Tuesday, the Davis administration was clearly trying to reassure the public that progress is being made on the governor's plan to pull the state out of the crisis. Since mid-January, when the big utilities' credit failed and suppliers stopped selling to them, the state has spent nearly $3 billion buying electricity from a handful of large suppliers in Texas, Oklahoma, Georgia and North Carolina. Not a cent has gone to the hundreds of alternative energy suppliers in California who provide about a quarter of the state's electricity. The Monday and Tuesday blackouts occurred partly because many of the cash-strapped alternative suppliers, including solar, biomass and wind power units, cut their normal supply to the system in half. They say Edison and PG&E have not paid them since November; the utilities say they are out of cash. Assemblyman Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek) said the plight of the alternative suppliers has dragged on because of the complexity of dealing with ""almost 700 individual contractors."" Another delaying factor, said Keeley, who with state Sen. Jim Battin (R-La Quinta) worked for almost three months to come up with a legislative plan to lower the small producers' prices, was ""the huge enmity . . . manifested between the utilities and the qualifying facilities. These people just don't like each other."" This week's blackouts provided two painful lessons for the Davis administration: * When it comes to electricity, size doesn't matter--every kilowatt counts. During peak use, a small wind power facility in Riverside County can make the difference between full power and blackouts. * There is no such thing as a partial solution. Unless the whole energy equation is balanced, the parts don't work. For the Davis plan to work, several key elements need to come together or utility customers will almost certainly face rate increases above the 19% already set in motion * The cost of power purchased by the state must be reduced through long-term contracts with the big out-of-state producers. These contracts, the details of which the Davis administration has kept confidential, are still being negotiated by Davis consultant Vikram Budhraja of the Pasadena firm Electric Power Group. The administration says it has concluded 40 contracts with generators, about half of which have been signed. According to the most recent statistics released by the Department of Water Resources, which buys power for the state, current prices are still well above the rate state Treasurer Phil Angelides says is necessary for a planned $10-billion bond offering to succeed. The bonds, set for sale in May, will be used to reimburse the state for the money it will have spent by that time to buy electricity. The state is currently spending at a rate of $58 million a day to buy power. If prices stay high, the $10 billion in bonds will not cover the state's power purchases by the end of the summer. Angelides says he cannot proceed with bridge financing for the bonds until the Public Utilities Commission devises a formula to guarantee that a portion of utility bills will be dedicated to bond repayment. Angelides has estimated that, under the January law that put the state in the power buying business, the state must be reimbursed $2.5 billion annually, and that $1.3 billion is needed to service the debt. PUC Administrative Law Judge Joseph R. DeUlloa is expected to announce his ruling on the reimbursement rate later this week, leading to a PUC vote on the matter as early as next week. * The rates charged for electricity by the alternative producers, known as qualifying facilities, must be cut at least in half, down from an average of more than 17 cents per kilowatt-hour. In his news conference Tuesday, Davis said he will ask the PUC to set QF rates at 6.9 cents for 10-year contracts and 7.5 cents for five-year contracts. Meanwhile, PUC Chairman Loretta Lynch, a Davis appointee, said Tuesday that the commission will vote next week on a proposed order requiring Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric to pay the QFs for electricity in the future. Lynch said a recent PUC assessment showed that the utilities have enough cash on hand for that. ""We are trying to make sure the folks providing the power get paid,"" Lynch said. ""The qualified facilities have demonstrated that they haven't been paid and that it is impairing their ability to provide power."" The utilities contend that if they pay the small providers what they owe them, there will not be enough money left to pay other creditors. ""There is not enough money in the current rate structure to pay the [alternative producers], pay the [Department of Water Resources] and pay the utilities for their generation,"" said John Nelson, a spokesman for PG&E. * The utilities must sell to the state the power they produce themselves, mainly from hydro and nuclear sources, at a rate only slightly above the cost of producing it. This is tied to the ongoing negotiations between the Davis administration and the utilities to restore the near-bankrupt utilities to solvency. * Times staff writers Julie Tamaki, Miguel Bustillo and Tim Reiterman contributed to this report. Davis OKs Subsidy of Pollution Fees Smog: As part of secret deal to get long-term energy contracts, state would pay for some of the credits that allow excess power plant emissions. Critics renew call for full disclosure. DAN MORAIN TIMES STAFF WRITER 03/21/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition A-23 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO -- As part of his closed-door negotiations to buy electricity, Gov. Gray Davis has agreed to relieve some generators from having to pay potentially millions of dollars in fees for emitting pollutants into the air, Davis said Tuesday. Davis announced two weeks ago that his negotiators had reached deals with 20 generators to supply $43 billion worth of power during the next 10 years. However, the Democratic governor has refused to release any of the contracts or detail various terms, contending that release of such information would hamper the state's ability to negotiate deals with other generators and therefore ultimately would raise prices Californians pay for electricity. Sources familiar with the negotiations, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the agreement reached with Dynegy Inc., a power company based in Houston, is one that includes language requiring that the state pay the cost of credits that allow emissions. Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel declined to discuss the company's deal with the state. ""We couldn't get them to sign contracts; it was a sticking point,"" Davis said of the decision to pay the fees of some generators. ""We had to lock down some power so we were not totally dependent on the spot market."" The fees in question are part of an emission trading system known as RECLAIM. Under the system, companies are allotted a certain amount of allowable pollution. If their operations pollute more, companies are required to purchase credits on an open market. Currently the credits cost about $45 per pound of pollution--an amount that can lead to a bill of well over $10 million a year for a power plant. The South Coast Air Quality Management District, which regulates pollution in the Los Angeles Basin, is considering steps to significantly lower the cost of the system--a step that could considerably cut the state's potential cost, Davis said. Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) defended the decision to cover the power company's costs. ""It is a question of whether it brings down the price of power,"" she said. ""If it brings down the price of power, I don't have a problem with it."" Nevertheless, word that the contracts could bind the state to pay pollution fees caused some critics of Davis' policy to renew calls for Davis to reconsider the secrecy surrounding the power negotiations. The payment provision underscores the fact that the contracts involve more than merely the prices the state will pay for its megawatts, the critics note. ""The Legislature should have known about it,"" said Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco). ""It is going to cost taxpayers money. It makes you wonder. . . . This was a policy issue that was never discussed with the Legislature."" V. John White, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club, who also represents alternative energy producers, called the contract proposal ""a horrible precedent."" ""Until we know exactly what the state has agreed to and how much of a subsidy this represents, we can't determine how serious the breach of principle this is,"" White said. Another critic of the secrecy of the negotiations, Terry Francke, general counsel for the California First Amendment Coalition, said the provision in question ""raises the possibility that there are other [concessions]"" that have not yet come to light. In the summer, when demand for power is highest, some generators probably will exceed pollution limits set by regional air quality management districts. To avert blackouts, state officials might ask the companies to keep plants running. In such cases, some sources familiar with aspects of the contracts said, the contract language could be interpreted to suggest that the state would cover any fines--although Davis said Tuesday the state will not cover the cost of fines. A recent Dynegy filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission underscores the rising cost of pollution-related measures. The company, which is partners with NRG Energy in three California plants in El Segundo, Long Beach and Carlsbad in San Diego County, said its ""aggregate expenditures for compliance with laws related to the regulation of discharge of materials into the environment"" rose to $14.3 million in 2000, from $3.6 million in 1999. A South Coast Air Quality Management spokesman said Dynegy's facilities appear to be fairly clean--although Sierra Club lobbyist White said Dynegy has been seeking a permit at one of its plants to burn fuel oil, which is dirtier than natural gas. Davis said he intends to ""make this information public,"" but he added that ""we do not want to put the public's interest in jeopardy by asking them to pay higher prices."" ""Nobody likes the notion that [the administration is] not being fully forthcoming,"" Davis said. ""But I also have a corollary responsibility that I don't stick these generators with a higher rate."" FERC ORDERS WILLIAMS ENERGY AND AES TO EXPLAIN THEIR REFUSAL TO MAKE CERTAIN RMR UNITS AVAILABLE TO CALIFORNIA ISO LAST YEAR 03/21/2001 Foster Electric Report 5 (c) Copyright 2001, Foster Associates, Inc. Following a preliminary, non-public investigation, FERC directed AES Southland Inc. and Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Co. (IN01-3) on March 14 to show cause why they did not violate section 205 of the Federal Power Act (FPA) by failing to provide power to the California ISO from two reliability must-run (RMR) generator units during a period in April and May 2000. The investigation responded to a matter referred by the Cal-ISO. If a violation is found, Williams Energy and AES could be required to refund excess profits of $10.9 million (as calculated by FERC) and face restrictions on their market-based rate authority for a year. The show cause order involves two generation units (Alamitos 4 and Huntington Beach 2), owned and operated by AES. Williams Energy markets all output from the Alamitos and Huntington Beach plants, including the two units at issue here, pursuant to a tolling agreement filed with the Commission. The Cal-ISO designated the two units as RMR units that it could call on when necessary to provide energy and ancillary service essential to the reliability of the California transmission network. The Cal-ISO makes both a fixed payment to the RMR owner or operator to compensate for the RMR unit's availability and a variable payment for the RMR unit's output (if the unit is not otherwise participating in the market). Williams Energy and the Cal-ISO executed RMR agreements, filed as rate schedules with the Commission, allowing the Cal-ISO to dispatch units ""solely for purposes of meeting local reliability needs or managing intra-zonal congestion."" The ISO may dispatch a non-RMR unit if the designated RMR unit is not available. Under its RMR agreement with the ISO, Williams is paid the greater of its contract price or marginal cost for operating RMR units. However, if a non-RMR unit has to be dispatched because a designated RMR unit is unavailable, Williams will be paid its bid price, not the RMR contract price. During the April to May 2000 period, the Cal-ISO sought to dispatch both Alamitos 4 and Huntington Beach 2 as RMR units to provide voltage support. However, according to the FERC order, Williams Energy refused to make Alamitos 4 available from April 25 through May 5, and to make Huntington Beach 2 available from May 6 through May 11, ""for reasons not directly related to the necessary and timely maintenance of the units."" Consequently, the Cal-ISO was forced to dispatch non-RMR units at a higher cost, namely, Williams Energy's bid price for service provided by the replacement units. By contrast, if the RMR units had not experienced outages and been available from April 25 through May 11, Williams Energy would have received either (1) the market revenues only from the respective units, which would have resulted in no payments for RMR output from the ISO to Williams Energy, or (2) Williams Energy's variable cost for operating the RMR units less the market revenues from the respective units' output. Accordingly, FERC observed, Williams Energy had ""a financial incentive to prolong any outages of Alamitos 4 and Huntington Beach 2 in April and May 2000."" The bid price for the non-RMR units was at or near the Cal-ISO's then-effective bid cap of $750/MWh, FERC continued. Therefore, Williams Energy received payments from the Cal-ISO of more than $11.3 million, or about $10.3 million greater than the estimated average variable operating cost of the non-RMR units (approximately $63/MWh) during the period in question. This indicates a refund amount, including interest, of nearly $10.9 million. The information in this order and a non-public appendix, the Commission declared, suggests that AES declared outages at the two RMR units and maintained Huntington Beach 2 in a manner inconsistent with good utility practice, and that Williams Energy took action to extend the outage at Alamitos 4 and to make Huntington Beach 2 unavailable for ""pretextual reasons."" Based on this information coupled with Williams Energy's financial incentive not to make the Alamitos 4 and Huntington Beach 2 units available, FERC found serious questions about whether (1) AES and Williams Energy violated applicable RMR contracts and tariffs on file with the Commission pursuant to FPA section 205 when they refused to make Alamitos 4 and Huntington Beach 2 available for dispatch by the Cal-ISO; (2) whether Williams acted inconsistently with its market-based rate authority and the market monitoring information protocols of the Cal-ISO's tariff regarding the unavailability of the RMR units during the period at issue; and (3) whether AES violated a tolling agreement on file with the Commission pursuant to section 205. The Commission identified two remedies for these potential violations: a refund by Williams Energy and/or AES of revenues received greater than the amount that would have collected from the ISO if the RMR units had been available, and a condition on Williams Energy's market-based rate authority. Specifically, for a one-year period, if an RMR unit were not available when dispatched by the Cal-ISO, a non-RMR unit dispatched in its place would only receive payment according to the terms of the applicable RMR contract. In other words, Williams Energy would not receive the bid price for operation of the substitute, non- RMR unit. The Commission directed Williams Energy and AES to show cause, within 20 days, why they should not be found to have committed the above-described violations and why the specified remedies should not be imposed. Further, to ensure procurement of all relevant information, the Commission instituted a formal, non-public investigation into the operation, maintenance and sales of power from the Alamitos and Huntington Beach plants in 2000 and 2001. Calif Consumers Failing To Conserve Pwr Despite Blackouts 03/20/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- California consumers haven't been conserving enough electricity to relieve strain on the power grid and reduce demand in the state, a spokesman with the Independent System Operator said Tuesday. The ISO said that despite two straight days of statewide rolling blackouts, consumers aren't using less electricity, which means additional megawatts will be taken off the grid. As a result, blackouts could last longer and impact additional communities, the ISO said. ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said Monday ""conservation in California is no longer an option,"" but consumers in the state aren't heeding the call to reduce consumption. Conservation efforts during rolling blackouts Monday and Tuesday were far less than Jan. 17 and Jan. 18, when blackouts swept through Northern California due to transmission constraints. Jim Detmers, the ISO's vice president of operation, said consumers saved the state about 1,000 megawatts of electricity, enough power for 1 million houses. The ISO said conservation efforts Monday were about 500 MW or less. ""We would be very happy if we saw the same amount this time,"" Detmers said. The state's Energy Commission said consumers think it's no longer important to save electricity until blackouts are imposed. ""People have been saving generally, but it isn't a big bump from hour to hour,"" a spokesman for the Energy Commission said. Gov. Gray Davis launched a massive conservation campaign this month, promising consumers a rebate on their summer electricity bill if they save at least 20% of electricity, compared with last summer. The governor said he believes conservation this summer will amount to possibly saving 5,000 MW and averting the chance of rolling blackouts. -By Jason Leopold; Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; jason.leopold@dowjones.com Gas Co.'s Success Opens Debate Southern California energy supplier has reaped millions of dollars in state incentives for keeping down its costs. Though consumers get a share of the windfall, regulators are asking whether they should get more of the bonus, which is expected to be huge this year, as a form of price relief. The natural gas provider says it deserves to keep its reward. TIM REITERMAN TIMES STAFF WRITER 03/18/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition C-1 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company SAN FRANCISCO -- While consumers suffer soaring energy bills and the big electric utilities lurch toward insolvency, the news is not all dire at Southern California Gas Co. Through vigorous deal making, the Sempra Energy subsidiary has consistently beaten the volatile natural gas market during the last year, and the company stands to reap millions of dollars in savings through a state incentive program that rewards utilities for keeping costs down. For several years, the utility has been splitting the savings 50-50 with ratepayers whenever the company's gas costs fall slightly below market levels. Those savings, Gas Co. executives acknowledged, have shot to unprecedented heights during the state's power crisis. Now, in this climate of high consumer gas bills and runaway market prices, regulators are taking another look at the program. The question before the Public Utilities Commission: Should Gas Co. ratepayers, who endured huge bill increases this winter, get a bigger share of the savings? The total windfall under the incentive program has in some years exceeded $20 million. But the amount for the last 12 months is expected to multiply many times over, company executives said, partly because the Gas Co. has done so well in the wild market by selling, lending and trading gas as well as buying it. ""The recent market conditions . . . could possibly result in some unintended consequences that result in shared savings of benefits that may be more appropriately allocated entirely to ratepayers,"" the PUC's consumer protection arm, the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, reported Oct. 30, even before the latest upward market spirals. Gas Co. representatives express frustration, saying they have done what the state has requested under its gas-cost incentive program: Buy smarter, and pass the savings along to its 5 million residential and small-business customers. The company contends it has worked hard to keep bills down and should be rewarded for taking risks to obtain gas at the lowest possible cost. ""The PUC, every time we do well, raises the bar on us,"" said Jim Harrigan, director of gas acquisition. ""I don't necessarily agree with it."" By virtue of its purchasing power and storage and pipeline capacity, the Gas Co. has become a big player in the regional natural gas market. In the company's bustling trading room at its Los Angeles headquarters, 15 employees track price movements, pipeline supplies and even the weather via computer, while cutting deals and arranging gas shipments. Although the Gas Co. buys the commodity for its customers, the company also sells to marketers, other utilities and producers. State officials say the number of transactions by the company has risen steeply to 10,000 to 20,000 a year, including gas sales along California's border, where prices have rocketed. The PUC created the cost incentive program for the state's three major gas utilities--San Diego Gas & Electric Co. in 1993, Southern California Gas the next year and PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric Co. in 1997. Like Southern California Gas, SDG&E is a subsidiary of Sempra Energy. The program was designed to give utilities added motivation for obtaining gas at the best price for customers. It replaced lengthy and contentious reviews by the PUC, which assessed whether utilities had purchased gas at reasonable prices and sometimes ordered them to return millions of dollars to customers. An annual audit of the Gas Co. program and a staff evaluation requested by the PUC recently concluded that the program has achieved many of its goals, but it also proposed adjustments that would give customers a greater share of the rewards. ""These incentives were designed in less volatile times,"" said program supervisor Mark Pocta of the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, which conducted the audit. ""There is a question of how much should go to ratepayers and shareholders."" His office also plans to assess whether the Gas Co.'s trading had any negative effects on the gas market, resulting in diminished supplies or higher prices for other utilities and their customers. Under the program, the Gas Co. shares risks and rewards with its ratepayers, but since the program was launched, it has consistently produced awards. If the cost of gas is 0.5% or more below a benchmark based on monthly gas market indexes, the company and its customers split the savings 50-50. California's gas utilities are not allowed to profit on their raw commodity costs; they merely pass along those costs to ratepayers with no markup. The savings under the incentive program are automatically reflected in consumers' monthly gas bills but are not itemized. At the end of the year, the utilities request their share of the savings, and the PUC has routinely granted approval. Then the companies, and thus their shareholders, are paid through customer utility bills. The resulting bill increases typically have been modest, less than 1%. But as the awards increase, regulators say, the effect on customers will become more significant unless the present structure is changed. ""There's no question, when you start to talk about $100 million [or more in savings], and add [the company's award] into rates in a year, it will make a noticeable difference,"" said Los Angeles economist Jeff Leitzinger, president of Econ One, who has done consulting for the Gas Co. Still, he said, ratepayers should bear in mind that they already benefit from below-market gas and transportation costs. In the early years of the program, records show, the Gas Co.'s awards went from zero to $3.2 million, $10.6 million, $2 million and $7.7 million. Last year's award of $9.8 million is awaiting PUC approval. This year's proposed award, covering the period through the end of this month, has not yet been submitted by the Gas Co. But the utility has provided monthly figures and oral updates on a confidential basis to PUC officials, who declined to provide figures. Harrigan of the Gas Co. said the savings are expected to multiply ""many times over,"" largely because the company was well-equipped for the market fluctuations and tried to insulate its customers from high gas prices. ""Any trading company, especially one with assets like we have, has benefited from volatility in the market,"" he said. Harrigan said, however, that he does not believe the company's level of activity has adversely affected the market and that its trading pales in volume to that of unregulated energy companies. Anne Smith, the Gas Co.'s vice president of customer service and marketing, said the utility will not release figures for this year's incentive program until they are filed with the PUC in June. ""I don't want to interrupt that process,"" Smith said, noting that the PUC ultimately will determine the company's award. ""I think they need to focus on what [the Gas Co.] has done for the ratepayers. It has been immense."" Although the typical monthly gas bill has risen to $80 from $50 a year ago, Gas Co. customers tend to have lower rates than those of other California utilities. The company's gas procurement cost in February was 66 cents per therm, or 100 cubic feet. That's more than twice last year's cost but only about half what sister company SDG&E paid for its 740,000 customers in February. It's also much lower than the $1.09 per therm PG&E pays. ""We were as upset about the overall [gas price] increase as anyone else,"" Harrigan said. ""I would rather see the prices of a year ago, even though we managed to do a little better in the [recent] environment."" When it comes to keeping down costs, regulators say, the Gas Co. has advantages over other utilities in the marketplace. For one, the company has so much pipeline capacity at major gas basins that it purchases a relatively small portion of its needs--about 10% to 15%--at the California border, where prices in December briefly rose to the equivalent of $6 per therm, or 20 times those a year earlier. This presents opportunities. ""At the beginning of the month, they forecast a certain amount of gas they have to buy,"" said Pocta of the Office of Ratepayer Advocates. ""If they go out and buy and do not need to use as much because the weather is more moderate than expected, they can either inject the gas into storage or they can make sales at the border."" With gas price run-ups like those seen in the last year, Pocta said, ""there is a question: Should that benefit be shared, or flow entirely to ratepayers?"" Customers, he pointed out, may be entitled to additional benefits because they pay for the interstate and intrastate pipeline capacity and the gas storage that give the company the flexibility to make advantageous deals. ""By the same token, we want [the Gas Co.] . . . to go into the market and generate cost savings that can be passed on to the customers,"" he added. ""We want them to have incentives. The question is how to balance them."" Under deregulation, the Gas Co. adopted the nontraditional role of marketer, according to a PUC Energy Division report in January. The company makes gas sales at various locations. It engages in exchanges. It makes futures transactions to help stabilize costs. ""They look for ways to lower the gas cost,"" said Richard Myers, program supervisor at the Energy Division. ""Before they were lots more risk-averse. Now they feel they can take risks and make money for shareholders, and it is a benefit for ratepayers at the same time."" The incentive programs are tailored to individual utilities, so it is difficult to compare them. Records show that the shared savings at SDG&E, a much smaller utility, declined steadily from $9.2 million in the 1996-97 cycle to $560,000 in 1999-2000. Spokesman Ed Van Herik said the falloff largely represents a drop in gas purchases, especially as the company sold off its own gas-fired electricity-generating plants. He said the company does not yet know how much savings have accrued in the last year. In an annual report to the PUC in February, PG&E said it had no savings under the incentive program and thus it is not entitled to any award for the 1999-2000 cycle. The Utility Reform Network, a San Francisco-based consumer advocacy group, said it will closely watch the PUC's evaluation of the incentive program at the Gas Co. ""We want to make sure, given the dramatic changes in the gas market and prices, ratepayers are not left out of the [additional] benefits,"" TURN attorney Marcel Hawiger said. ""We'll look to see whether the mechanism should be changed."" Severin Borenstein, director of the Energy Institute at UC Berkeley, said the program should be changed to provide more incentive for utilities to enter long-term contracts that would smooth out volatility in the market. ""Unfortunately, under the system,"" he said, ""the only incentive is to beat the [spot] market.""

Delivering the keynote address at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's national energy summit in Washington Monday, Abraham said, ""California is not the only state facing a mismatch between supply and demand,"" what with ""electricity shortages predicted for New York City and Long Island this summer"" and low capacity margins threatening electricity reliability elsewhere across the country. But how likely is it that New Yorkers will face blackouts of the sort confronting Californians? Not very, says energy trade specialist Edward Krapels, managing director of Boston-based METIS Trading Advisors. Krapels, a consultant helping major Northeastern utilities, such as Consolidated Edison, design market-hedging programs, adamantly decried what he said are facile comparisons between conditions in New York and California, there being ""more differences than there are similarities"" between those two industrial cornerstones of the country's economy in respect to energy security management. ""First of all, New York has a more varied portfolio of energy generation sources than California,"" he said. California has hydro, nuclear and gas, but when it lost a lot of hydro, the state needed gas to pick up the slack, and the ""capacity just wasn't there."" In New York's case, the state has oil and coal still in the mix and its overall dependence on gas is much lower than California's, Krapels added. New York avoids making same mistakes Portfolio diversity is one pillar of any effective plan to help New York avoid the same errors made in redesigning California's marketplace. New York's Independent System Operator (ISO), in a new report warning that the state is at an ""energy crossroads"" in terms of its capacity adequacy in the immediate future, argues that a concerted effort is required to arrest declining in-state generation capacity reserve margins, and a strategy must be put in place, whether or not new generation comes on-line, in accordance with current anticipated scenarios. A measure of New York's essential difficulty is that, between 1995 and 2000, statewide demand for electricity grew 2,700 MW, while generating capacity expanded by only 1,060 MW. With no major new generating plants in downstate New York fully approved, the gap is expected to continue to widen. To avoid ""a replication of California's market meltdown"" the New York ISO calculates the state's daily generating capacity needs to grow by 8,600 MW by 2005, with more than half of that located in New York City and on Long Island. Expressing concern this may be too big a burden for the current bureaucratic process to bear, the ISO wants to see a state-appointed ombudsman named to help would-be merchant power plant investors plow through red tape. ""Increasing New York's generating capacity will also lessen the state's escalating and risky reliance on out-of-state sources of electricity,"" the ISO added. ""Since 1999, New York State has been unable to cover its reserve requirements from in-state sources."" Not everyone agrees with that analysis, insofar as it argues for circling the wagons inward. Some analysts believe the ultimate solution lies not in tying in more inwardly dedicated power, but in expanding the marketplace by breaking down inter-jurisdictional barriers. In any case, New York energy regulatory authorities and those responsible elsewhere in the U.S. Northeast, such as PJM (Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland) Interconnection and the New England Power Pool, are in vastly better shape in terms of ""cross-border"" cooperation than California and its neighbors in that efforts are being made among various authorities toward developing an integrated regional electricity market. In California, by contrast, the state's focus?for example, in the case of new gas-fired power plant development?has been to ensure dedicated supply to the California market alone, rather than on a regional marketplace. (Embedded image moved to file: pic05075.pcx) The New York ISO's new broad-based analysis of market-restructuring needs argues that the relatively stronger health of its reformed environment is ""due in large part to the ability of New York's utilities to enter into long-term power contracts."" What needs to be done most, it says, is to move aggressively to build some of the more than 29,000 MW of ""proposed new generation in the siting pipeline."" In the meantime, the 30,200 MW of electricity New Yorkers used on a peak day last summer shouldn't be eclipsed on too many days this coming summer (given early long-range weather forecasts). Demand, however, is expected to increase at an annual average rate of up to 1.4%. So while New York City, the rest of the state and adjacent parts might breathe easy this year, it could be a brief rest from the fray. Meanwhile, a 4% shortfall is still being planned for this summer that is not yet provided for, as authorities hurriedly seek to arrange new generation plants around Manhattan, on Long Island and even on barges offshore. One way or another, whether it is the weather or the politics of siting new energy facilities, it's going to be a hot time in the city. Long-term solutions hit brick wall Meanwhile, attempts at longer-term solutions continue to run into trouble. Last week, Connecticut state regulators came out against a proposal to run a new underwater cable under Long Island Sound that Hydro-Quebec subsidiary TransEnergie U.S. Ltd. wants to build to pump more juice into Long Island Power Authority's load pocket. Despite strong promises from TransEnergie to be diligent in avoiding damage to oyster beds in Long Island Sound, the proposal failed to convince authorities, who were persuaded the pipeline project could lead to diversion of electricity from Connecticut. In similar fashion, private companies wanting to build 10 small independent power plants and temporary generators offshore New York City are running into intense opposition from environmental groups and citizen orga nizations?some of whom have taken their cases to the state assembly in Albany. The David vs. Goliath nature of such controversies has further alerted energy companies to the difficulties of addressing complex energy supply issues that may ultimately devolve to people not wanting things in their backyard, regardless of what the alternative might mean to their fellow citizens or the greater public good. But suddenly, in New York, California's troubles?while still distant in their intensity? may not be so far away. By some estimates, this summer's bills for Consolidated Edison customers could be up as much as one third or more over last year's charges. Letting the time slip when it comes to building new infrastructure isn't going to make the pain go away. NEW YORK: NY-ISO REPORT SAYS STATE NEEDS 4,000 - 5,000 MW OF NEW GENERATION SOON TO AVOID SEVERE SHORTAGES; NY-ISO ALSO ASKS FERC TO EXTEND BID CAP AND TEMPORARY EMERGENCY PROCEDURES 03/21/2001 Foster Electric Report 2 (c) Copyright 2001, Foster Associates, Inc. Raising the specter of an East Coast version of the California crisis, the New York Independent System Operator, Inc. (NY-ISO) is warning of serious electricity shortages, air quality deterioration and stunted economic growth without immediate approval of between 4,000-5,000 MW of new generating capacity in the state. Of this amount, 2,000-3,000 MW is needed to serve New York City. Another 8,600 MW of new capacity will have to be built by 2005, the NY-ISO said in a recent report, Power Alert: New York's Energy Crossroads. ""New York is heading towards a very serious situation unless it acts immediately to get new supply sited within its borders,"" said NY-ISO president William Museler in a statement accompanying the report. ""This report is essentially a caution light at New York's energy crossroads."" Sources in the New York Public Service Commission have downplayed the NY-ISO's warning, asserting that a process for bringing on new generation is well underway, with more than 85 projects in the approval pipeline. In a related development, the NY-ISO asked FERC to approve a proposed tariff amendment (ER01-1517) extending existing bids caps in some of its markets until 10/31/02, and a separate and related amendment (ER01-1489) extending the NY-ISO's so-called temporary extraordinary procedures (TEP) that allow the ISO to make price adjustments and take other corrective actions if it finds evidence of market power abuse. The NY-ISO Report --The NY-ISO likened the situation in New York to that faced by California, where a relentless increase in demand has not been met with an equal increase in supply. The NY-ISO said that between 1995 and 2000, statewide demand for electricity rose by 2,700 MW, while generating capacity increased by only 1,060 MW. With no major new generating plants in downstate New York fully approved for construction at this time and generation demand in the state expected to grow around 1.3 percent annually for the next several years, the NY-ISO said this gap will continue to widen. The inevitable result of this trend is large rate increases for New York's power consumers. The NY-ISO's modeling suggests that ""by 2005, statewide prices are likely to be more than 20-25 percent lower in the case in which new plants are built than in the case where they are not."" In New York City, ""the price to consumers of electric power could be reduced by as much as 28 percent when compared to the case of no new supply or load management programs."" Besides large rate increases, the NY-ISO asserted that a failure to site and build new plants in New York will threaten power reliability in the state and lead to increasing reliance on out-of-state resources. The report said that if no new in-state generation comes on line in the next five years, the state's generation reserve margins will shrink from the current 14.9 percent above peak demand ""to a dangerously low 8.4 percent by 2005."" Pointing to California's situation, the report added that increased reliance on power imports ""can subject electrical suppliers and customers in New York to transmission restrictions and political and economic considerations beyond the control or influence of responsible New York State entities."" To avoid these harsh consequences, the NY-ISO said New York's new siting law, known as the Article X process, needs to be modified. Since the law was passed 18 months ago, the report noted that only two plants have been approved (both upstate) and neither has yet been built. The problem, according to the NY-ISO, is that the siting process ""requires the cooperation of multiple state agencies."" To expedite the process, the report suggested the ""clear designation of a lead agency and the adoption of an `ombudsman program' to expedite and coordinate the work of the agencies responsible for the Article X process must be made."" The NY-ISO added that an expedited approval process would improve the environment because older, more polluting power plants would be replaced by cleaner gas-fired units. On a more positive note, the NY-ISO reported that New York's restructured power market ""is far healthier than that in California, due in large part to the ability of New York `s utilities to enter long-term power contracts. The basic structure of the New York market will also reduce unwarranted price spikes and other market disruptions through mitigation programs which automatically correct price spikes due to market power abuses."" ""Nevertheless, California `s experience raises a caution flag for all New Yorkers,"" the report continued. ""The deregulated market in New York cannot achieve lower costs through competition without an increase in generating capacity similar in magnitude to the recommendations of this report, along with simultaneous efforts to institute greater conservation, better load management and alternative energy supply initiatives. Additionally, closer integration with regional suppliers of power is both inevitable and beneficial."" The report also recommended (1) accelerating conservation, real-time metering and price-sensitive load programs; and (2) upgrading the state's and the Northeast's transmission infrastructure. The Proposed Tariff Amendments -- New York's Article X siting process and continuing tight supplies were also cited in the NY-ISO's request to extend from 4/30/01 until 10/31/02 its $1,000/MWh bid caps. FERC first approved the 1,000/MWh bid caps in July 2000 (see REPORT No.197, pg.6), and subsequently extended them. The NY-ISO's board ""is sensitive to the Commission's concerns about undue intervention in energy markets,"" the filing related. ""Nevertheless, the NY-ISO is submitting this request because it believes that delays in New York state's `Article X' process for licensing and siting new generating capacity is inhibiting supply from increasing to match continued demand growth. . . . Moreover, although the NY-ISO proposes to implement several demand-side measures this summer, it is not yet clear whether they will make demand sufficiently price-responsive to avoid periods of high prices that would not occur if there were an efficient demand-side response."" Thus, the NY-ISO insisted that the requested extension is needed to provide more time for the development of additional generation and to gauge the effectiveness of the NY-ISO's proposed demand-side response mechanisms ""in order to avoid exposing consumers to price spikes that are not a product of the interplay of competitive market forces."" Other problems cited in the NY-ISO's filing which keep New York's power market from being fully competitive include continuing capacity and operating constraints at the state's Central-East interface, and questions over adequate gas supply. ""The NY-ISO remains acutely aware that taking steps to deal with price abnormalities can have undesirable consequences,"" the filing continued. ""Nevertheless, the NY-ISO believes that the $1,000/MWh cap that has been used in the PJM's markets since inception does not appear to have had an adverse impact there. . . . The permanent bid caps in PJM, and the interim bid caps in ISO New England (proposed for extension through the end of 2001) also make continuation of the NY-ISO's bid caps more important in order to maintain uniformity across the Northeastern markets. The NY-ISO also continues to believe that suppliers will not be materially harmed by the continuation of bid caps, which are likely to come into effect very rarely and are set at levels that prevent only artificially high run-ups in prices."" The NY-ISO's request to extend its TEP procedures (which also were previously extended) through 10/31/02 cited similar problems with New York's power markets, but claimed that the NY-ISO ""has made great strides"" toward eliminating market design and software flaws. ""The TEPs were, and remain, an indispensable tool for responding to and correcting market flaws and other instances where the markets are not operating as the NY-ISO and the Commission intended,"" the filing insisted. MASSACHUSETTS: Attorney general says summer poses electricity concerns By JOHN McELHENNY Associated Press Writer 03/19/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. BOSTON (AP) - The state's top consumer advocate warned that Massachusetts may see ""California-type"" electricity blackouts this summer when temperatures rise and residents turn on air conditioners and fans. ""It would be a mistake to feel this is a cold weather problem,"" said Attorney General Thomas Reilly in an interview with The Associated Press. ""Our major problem will come this summer."" State deregulation of the electric industry has been among the factors blamed for local power outages in California, and on Monday, California for the first time suffered rolling blackouts across the entire state. Massachusetts relaxed regulations on its own electric industry in 1998 to attract more companies to stir competition. But that hasn't happened yet, largely because the current high cost of oil and gas make it expensive to produce electricity. ""The promise of deregulation was that there was going to be competition,"" said Reilly, a Democrat. ""That competition in the wholesale market is not happening."" Hot summer weather drives up electricity use as residents turn on air conditioners and fans, and Reilly said a few particularly hot days could strain the grid that provides the region's power. A spokeswoman for the region's power grid said electricity use is expected to rise 1.5 to 2 percent this year, but the region should have enough power because of six new power plants that have begun generating electricity in the past 18 months. ""The situation is unlike California because we have new generation coming on line that is outpacing demand,"" said Ellen Foley, spokeswoman for ISO New England Inc., which manages the grid of 330 generators connected by 8,000 miles of high voltage transmission lines. Still, a particularly hot day and an unforeseen power generation breakdown could prompt ISO to ask residents to conserve electricity, a situation that arose once last summer, Foley said. In order to avoid any power outages and protect consumers, Reilly repeated calls for electric companies to build more power lines and to offer more options for new customers who have signed up since deregulation. Those customers typically pay more than long-term customers. Electric transmission companies should also be allowed to enter into two-year contracts with suppliers, instead of the six-month contracts many have now, to avoid short-term price spikes for consumers, Reilly said. The Attorney General's Office acts as an advocate for consumers. Michael Monahan, a spokesman for NSTAR, which provides electricity to more than 1 million customers, is upgrading some of its power lines and last year built a new line to Cape Cod, but currently has no lines under construction. ""I wholeheartedly concur with the attorney general that it's something we have to focus on,"" Monahan said, but he added, ""The indications I see are that we have an ample supply of electricity."" California's statewide outages were ordered on Monday after a transformer fire, high demand and a lack of electricity imports pushed power reserves to near zero. California partially deregulated its electric industry in 1996, two years before Massachusetts. --- On the Net: Attorney General's Office: http://www.ago.state.ma.us NSTAR: http://www.nstaronline.com ISO New England Inc.: http://www.iso-ne.com NEVADA: Discussion of bill stopping power plant sales to continue Wednesday By JOHN WILKERSON Associated Press Writer 03/19/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) - Lawmakers hit more delays Monday in trying to pass a measure that pulls the plug on the sale of Nevada power plants to avoid California-style energy problems. ""The goal of this bill is only stopping the divestiture of power plants and making sure it's constitutional,"" said Senate Commerce and Labor Chairman Randolph Townsend, R-Reno. ""And that's not as easy as it sounds."" Townsend's comment just before his committee began working on SB253 was prophetic - witnesses kept bringing up the need for more flexibility in the measure. Translation: Don't kill all deals by stopping Reno-based Sierra Pacific Power and Las Vegas-based Nevada Power from selling their Nevada power plants until June 2003 - and possibly until 2006. Pete Ernaut, a lobbyist for Reliant Energy which has been trying to buy a power plant, said unforeseen market changes could make a plant sale before 2003 a deal that would be in the public's interest. ""If you put a two-year moratorium on these plants, all these deals are going to go away,"" he said. ""When the cow leaves the barn, it's difficult to catch."" Townsend had hoped to wrap up committee work on SB253 on Monday. Now it's up for review again Wednesday in the Commerce and Labor Committee. Reliant isn't the only company trying to keep power plant purchases alive. Earlier this month, executives of Pinnacle West Energy told the committee that it's in the public's interest to allow Sierra Pacific Resources to sell its Harry Allen power plant. The Harry Allen plant produces about 72 megawatts out of the 2,900 megawatts of energy that Nevada utilities generate. Pinnacle has plans to expand that to 700 megawatts by 2004. Other provisions not strictly related to the plant divestitures, such as ways in which Sierra Pacific and Nevada Power can recover the cost of undoing the sales contracts, don't have to be included in SB253, Townsend said. Townsend said the other concerns dealing with the energy crisis and utility deregulation can be handled in later bills - but the power plant sale issue must be handled now. Nevada's PUC and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission had directed Sierra Pacific and Nevada Power to sell the plants as a condition of the companies' merger in 1999 under the parent company Sierra Pacific Resources. Critics of the plant sales say the plants generate about half the state's electricity - and if they're sold, the unregulated new owners could sell the power to other states and put Nevada into the energy dilemma California faces of shrinking supply and rising prices. The Southern Nevada Water Authority has presented an analysis stating that rate payers will save from $1.7 billion to $3.5 billion by July 2001 if the power plant sales are stopped. Nevada's Consumer Advocate's Office previously had projected a conservative estimate of $915 million in savings. MAINE: Panel of experts would review impact of energy deregulation By GLENN ADAMS Associated Press Writer 03/19/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) - In the wake of rolling blackouts in California and rate spikes in their home state, Maine's top legislators proposed a study Monday into the effects of deregulation of the energy industry. ""Deregulation of electricity is a new idea and we still have a lot to learn,"" Senate President Michael Michaud said as he called for the analysis. A panel of industry insiders, elected officials and consumers would study issues such as what standard rate consumers can expect and the likelihood of energy shortfalls over the next three years, and whether Maine consumers are vulnerable to anti-competitive activities. In addition, the Blue Ribbon Commission would look into whether changes in Maine's deregulation law are needed to encourage more generating capacity, improve conservation and spur competition. The study is being proposed as consumers remain mindful of a power crisis in California that resulted from high wholesale energy costs, a consumer rate cap and too few power plants in that deregulated state. Maine's deregulation law is designed to avoid such pitfalls, said Rep. William Savage, D-Buxton, House chairman of the Legislature's Utilities Committee. Maine's law does not cap consumer prices, as California's does, and the state has more than enough generating facilities to meet the state's energy needs, Savage said. Since Maine's deregulation law took effect in March 2000, Bangor Hydro-Electric Co. rates have increased 19 percent. The Public Utilities Commission approved a residential standard rate increase as recently as last month. Federal energy regulators are reviewing their decision to allow steep fee increases for utilities and power wholesalers that fail to arrange enough capacity to meet customers' peak load. Gov. Angus King and all four members of Maine's congressional delegation oppose the hike. The PUC has approved standard rate increases for energy delivered by Central Maine Power Co. to medium-sized and large industrial users. On the other hand, some towns and school districts are saving money on energy through deals they can get in the deregulated market. In the meantime, legislation has been introduced in response to some of the changes that have occurred in Maine's deregulated energy industry. One would use some of the money from the sale of power-generating assets to offset an increase in rates paid by large industrial users, said Sen. Norman Ferguson, R-Hanover, Senate chairman of the Utilities Committee. Supporters of the utility study that was proposed Monday said they are not looking to make changes in Maine's deregulation law, but if it needs fixing it could be done during next year's session. The lawmakers' primary interest is to find out how trends in a new environment designed to encourage competition will affect consumers, and to try to identify what consumers can expect in the few years ahead. House Speaker Michael Saxl, D-Portland, said the Legislature ""has a fundamental public policy interest in making sure rate-payers and businesses are protected against exorbitant rate hikes."" Michaud, D-East Millinocket, said he's interested in finding out how future changes in electric prices and availability might affect businesses and consumers in northern Maine. ""The economy in my part of the state is the most vulnerable, and I want to make certain we are leaving no stone unturned in our effort to prevent any shocks to the economy in northern, western and eastern Maine,"" Michaud added. The commission would include House and Senate members from each party, a utility executive, and representatives of energy producers, providers, a large commercial consumer and individual consumers. OREGON: State Senate moves to combat energy crisis 03/16/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. SALEM, Ore. (AP) - In an attempt to avoid a California-like energy crisis, the Oregon Senate approved a bill Friday that would quicken the process of siting power plants that use gas and renewable resources. ""It's important for Oregon. It makes sure that energy will be available to everyone,"" said Sen. Lee Beyer, D-Springfield. The measure, SB843, would shorten the siting process for power plants that use gas and renewable resources, like wind, from a year and a half to a matter of months. The speeded-up process would be in effect for two years. ""If we can act now, we can actually start to solve power supply problems by this summer,"" said Sen. Jason Atkinson, R-Jacksonville California's strict regulations on the construction of new power plants has contributed to its current shortage and legislators took note. Beyer said though California was definitely a wake-up call, the measure is a reaction to the larger power picture in the Northwest. With low rainfall, hydroelectric generators will have trouble meeting demand, Beyer said. Gas-fired and wind plants could come online as soon as this fall and would provide relief. ""We are not in a position to sit back and do nothing about the energy crisis the Northwest and the country are experiencing,"" said Senate Minority Leader Kate Brown, D-Portland. Conservationists, however, caution that lawmakers should be careful not to rush to provide power at the expense of environmental standards. WISCONSIN: Two utilities to add 975 megawatts in plan to avoid energy crisis By The Associated Press 03/22/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Plans of two state utilities to add 975 megawatts to Wisconsin's electric power grid as a way of avoiding an energy crisis similar to California's were questioned Thursday by a consumer advocate who said too many power plants may be in the works. ""Certainly nobody wants to see blackouts like you have in California but there is the danger Wisconsin could be overbuilding,"" said Steve Hiniker, executive director of the Citizens' Utility Board, which represents consumer interests in utility rate cases. He noted that plant construction costs ultimately are born by the utility customers. Alliant Energy Corp. announced its proposal Wednesday - in a filing with the state Public Service Commission - to spend $1 billion to build one coal and two gas-fired power plants. Alliant has proposed building a 500 megawatt coal-fired plant and a 100 megawatt natural-gas fired plant by 2006. It also wants to build a 200 megawatt natural gas-fired facility in 2011. Wisconsin has not built a coal-fired plant in more than two decades. Alliant has not determined the plants' locations. Also, Madison Gas & Electric, the state's smallest investor-owned utility, said Wednesday that it had signed deals to buy 175 megawatts of power from three generating plants in Wisconsin and Illinois. ""Three out of the four past summers, we've had public appeals for conservation due to shortages somewhere in the state. We need to take steps to avoid that, and the California situation makes that even more clear,"" said Alliant spokesman Chris Schoenherr. ""Getting more iron in the ground will give us more flexibility in the state to be able to react."" Alliant acknowledged the new plants will probably mean rate increases, but it was too early to say how much rates would go up. California's problems, which this week resulted in the first deliberate blackouts since World War II, stemmed from underestimating the state's power needs, forcing utilities to sell their power plants but not allowing them to secure long-term supply contracts, and freezing rates, among other things. But Wisconsin's situation is far different. The state has moved slower than California toward deregulation, and there has been no desire here to speed up the process in recent years as power reliability became a problem. The PSC estimates that Wisconsin will need an additional 3,000 megawatts of power over the next decade. Hiniker said Wisconsin needs to coordinate its planning to avoid overbuilding. The costs of new power plants are passed on to ratepayers, meaning electric bills will increase as new generation is added. In addition, coal-generated power plants are a major source of air pollution in the state. ""We don't have the advance planning that has kept Wisconsin from overbuilding in the past,"" said Hiniker. ""This is something the PSC should be doing."" MG&E's deals are: -A 10-year contract to buy 75 megawatts from Calpine Energy Services starting in May 2004. The power will come from the natural gas-fired plant Rock River Energy Center, near Beloit. Calpine Energy Services is a unit of San Jose, Calif.-based Calpine Energy Corp. The plant is being built by Northbrook, Ill.-based SkyGen Energy LLC, which Calpine bought last year from SkyGen President Michael Polsky and Wisvest Corp., a unit of Wisconsin Energy Corp. -A 10-year contract to buy 50 megawatts of power from the Rainy River Energy Corp. starting in May 2002. The power is coming from a natural gas-fired plant near Joliet, Ill. owned by LS Power Co. Rainy River is a unit of Duluth-based Minnesota Power Inc. -A five-year contract to buy 50 megawatts from an El Paso Merchant Energy plant near Cordova, Ill., in western Illinois. The owner of the natural gas facility is the Cordova Energy Center Co., which is a unit of Iowa-based MidAmerican Energy Holdings. Alliant also offered support in the Wednesday filing for a $7 billion plan of Milwaukee-based Wisconsin Energy, which includes five new power plants in Oak Creek and Pleasant Prairie. -- On the Net: CUB: http://www.wiscub.org/ Alliant Energy: http://www.alliant-energy.com Wisconsin Public Service Commission: http://www.psc.state.wi.us Wisconsin Energy: http://www.wisenergy.com/ Madison Gas & Electric: http://www.mge.com Use this file to download and print all the articles in this section (See attached file: Dow Jones If you wish to be removed from the distribution list for this update please contact Pru Sheppard - DC.

Subject:: RE: Senate Reliability Billl
Body:: It would not be accurate to conclude or assert that the NERC language is ""close"" to congressional approval. Here is the state of play. There are two interrelated tracks at present: the DeLay, et al negotiations of all stakeholders (which I attended and participated in today but did not concern reliability) and the NERC process that is underway to consider how to bring those such as Enron that are not ""on board"" with the so-called ""consensus"" NERC language (Sarah participated in the Tuesday meeting on this issue, where PJM put a proposal on the table that Sarah advises largely tracks our draft; this process will continue next week and a follow up meeting the week after). The interrelationship is that it is likely that IF (a big IF) there is an electric title that is added to the congressional bill that will start moving in the House subcommittee next week, the NERC version will be included as a ""place holder"" with the understanding that if the NERC discussion process yields a different result, it will be substituted. Furthermore, those who oppose the NERC version would be free to continue opposing it on the Hill and elsewhere. So you might say there is a rebuttable ""presumption"" of sorts in favor of the NERC version (which is shorter than the old NERC version) because so many groups favor it, but those who oppose it such as ourselves continue to seek allies for a shorter, streamlined version. Congress is far from approving any final version.

A sample can=20 be viewed at: SCIENTECH IssueAlert, October 11, 2000 Online Niche Players Capitalize on Natural-Gas Shortage, Bypass Utilities By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis SmartEnergy, a Con Edison competitor, is offering New York and Westchester= =20 consumers price protection with the ability to lock-in today's natural-gas= =20 rates for a period of one year. In a separate announcement, myHomeKey.com= =20 announced that it will offer energy savings packages designed to reduce=20 energy consumption and lower rates for customers in the face of rising=20 energy costs. ANALYSIS: As reports continue to accumulate that a natural-gas shortage=20 will send prices skyrocketing this winter (see my IssueAlert from Oct.=20 9 on the subject), the most common response from electric utilities has=20 been to warn their customers that they will see higher rates over the next= =20 few months. I can point to several examples. Minneapolis-based Xcel Energy= =20 announced a few weeks back that its natural-gas customers could face heatin= g=20 bills that are 35 to 50 percent higher than their bills last winter. Domini= on=20 East Ohio has warned its residential customers that they can expect to=20 pay about $70 more per month for natural gas from November through January.= =20 And the warnings are coming not only in the Midwest and Northeast=01*where= =20 low winter temperatures drive up energy bills every year=01*but in the West= =20 as well. In California, PG&E warns that its customers can expect to see=20 their winter bills increase by about $25, to an average bill of $75 (compar= ed=20 to $50 last winter). These are just a few examples of utility companies=20 across the United States playing damage control, trying to minimize the=20 customer outrage when customers suddenly see their bills double or triple. Along with their warnings, these utilities give reasons=01*perhaps seen as= =20 excuses by the public=01*for the rising cost of energy. There is a shortage= =20 of natural gas across the country, brought about by a drop-off in productio= n.=20 It was an unusually hot summer, which depleted supplies for energy. Demand= =20 in general has grown to surprising levels. Meanwhile, start-up online companies that many of us have not even heard=20 of are using the rise in natural-gas prices as a golden marketing=20 opportunity,=20 and attempting to take business away from traditional utility companies.=20 SmartEnergy is a perfect example. In existence just since April 1999, =20 SmartEnergy offers electricity and natural gas to residential and small=20 business customers. According to EnergyGuide.com, for an average home in=20 New York City, SmartEnergy's natural-gas rates typically have run about=20 $189 per month, compared Con Edison's $140. Under its new promotion,=20 SmartEnergy's=20 plan for natural gas guarantees that New York City and Westchester gas=20 customers who sign on with their service now will be locked into current=20 natural-gas rates for the next 12 months. This promotion comes at an ideal= =20 time for those who opt to switch, as natural-gas prices should begin their= =20 projected sharp increase over the next few weeks. Based on recent forecasts= ,=20 SmartEnergy is claiming that Con Edison customers who make the switch can= =20 expect to save up to 40 percent on their energy through the winter months.= =20 The start-up company also is offering 500 United Airlines Mileage Plus=20 Reward Miles credit and $25 sign-up bonus to entice customers away from=20 Con Edison.=20 Based on the available information about SmartEnergy, it is unclear how=20 the online provider will be able to guarantee the 40-percent reduction=20 in natural-gas rates. I would presume that SmartEnergy has entered into=20 some hedging strategies to minimize its risk in the event that natural-gas= =20 prices remain high into the next year. Any prudent provider would have=20 a hedging strategy to protect itself, and locking itself into 12-month=20 contracts without its own contracts for obtaining natural gas at spot marke= t=20 prices would certainly raise questions about the future of SmartEnergy.=20 In addition, SmartEnergy will have difficulty in recruiting customers away= =20 from Con Edison and other utility providers. Many customers still have=20 reservations about signing on with an online company that they do not know.= =20 There will be some customers who jump at the chance to lock in current=20 rates for 12 months, but many others will stick with the company that they= =20 know even if their rates increase. I did a quick search around Con Edison's Website to see if it might be=20 offering an alternative offer to retain its customers, but could find nothi= ng=20 that the utility is doing to specifically address the projected increase=20 in natural-gas prices this winter. Con Edison does offer a level billing=20 program in which customers receive a consistent bill amount each month,=20 alleviating fluctuation in their bills. Yet, as a utility company, Con=20 Edison has a standard offer of service that regulators closely monitor.=20 It is possible that Con Edison could request changes to the standard offer= =20 service, which would likely need to be approved by the New York Public=20 Service Commission. The PSC could agree, or determine that the competitive= =20 offers by providers such as Smart Energy are a positive result of=20 deregulation.=20 In addition, Con Edison could be hampered by fuel contracts that may not=20 allow it much flexibility with regard to lowering its rates. Overall, Con= =20 Edison probably does not have a lot of flexibility regarding the rates=20 it can charge customers, thereby making this offer from SmartEnergy difficu= lt=20 to beat. The other online start-up taking advantage of natural-gas prices is=20 myHomeKey.com,=20 which made a recent promise to reduce home heating, oil, natural-gas, and= =20 electricity rates. The marketing route that this online start-up is taking= =20 is energy efficiency=01*teaching households how to more effectively use the= ir=20 energy and, hopefully, save money as a result. Energy is not the only servi= ce=20 of the myHomeKey.com; it is also involved in home maintenance and repair,= =20 appliances, home monitoring and moving services. Yet, I learned that=20 myHomeKey.com=20 just recently launched co-branded sites with KeySpan Corp. and TXU Energy= =20 Services to ""provide millions of local customers"" with the ability to check= =20 energy efficiency in their homes. What's important to note about these two developments is the advantage=20 that online energy providers have over traditional utilities. As utilities= =20 try to disengage themselves from regulatory-bound rate structures, online= =20 companies have the freedom and flexibility to offer attractive products=20 and billing options to customers in deregulated states. There are the onlin= e=20 providers that we know about, such as Utility.com and Essential.com.=20 Utility.com=20 has not yet started to sell natural gas, although it has established a=20 partnership with Sempra Energy in which Sempra Energy Trading will sell=20 natural gas in deregulated markets via the Utility.com Web site.

Subject:: Transredes spill
Body:: Do we have someone who works for us now who was at Transredes when the government owned it and could help us do a comparison between our respective environmental records? It seems to me that even though we are having our share of problems, we have probably had fewer problems than the government did and have probably been more responsive and thorough in our clean up efforts. Obviously, we would need to be judicious about how we used such information (we don't want to aggravate the government), but having such an analysis may be helpful in showing the progress made and in discouraging overly punitive action by the government. What do you think?

Subject:: CalPX Told To Release Confidential Trade Data To ..
Body:: CalPX Told To Release Confidential Trade Data To State 09/22/2000 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones&Company, Inc.) LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- California's Electricity Oversight Board has ordered the state's Power Exchange to hand over confidential information to the board regarding the trading activities of utilities, generation companies and other market participants who traded power at the exchange since June, according to a copy of a subpoena obtained by Dow Jones Newswires. The subpoena marks the first time the state will gain access and learn how each company traded power in the day-of, day-ahead and block forward markets. Moreover, the EOB subpoena requests the CalPX release the names of the participants who traded power at the exchange since June to better understand how and why the participants conduct business in the various markets at the exchange. The CalPX has until Wednesday to hand over ""aggregate supply and demand curves, individual firm bid dates, final schedules for each firm by generating unit, injection point and take out point,"" from June 1 through September and continue supplying trading data through Nov. 1. In addition, the subpoena requests ""block forward trade positions by firm for June, July, August and September"" and that this information continue to be supplied through October and November. The subpoena is part of the state's ongoing investigation into California's troubled deregulated electricity market, which has resulted in high wholesale power prices in San Diego, landmark legislative action and accusations of collusion, price gouging and market power. Gov. Gray Davis ordered an investigation in June, when power prices soared to near record levels and rolling blackouts wreaked havoc in the Bay Area. The CalPX said it will comply with the EOB request and that a subpoena to access the confidential information is required according to the rules of the exchange. But the EOB will be required to protect the confidentiality of each trade it gains insight into as well as the identities of the participants who traded. If the trading activities of a company or other participant is leaked or becomes public it could have a devastating affect on the company and the EOB would be held liable, according to the CalPX. The CalPX said it must notify each and every participant who traded power in its various markets to alert them of the EOB subpoena. -By Jason Leopold; Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; jason.leopold@dowjones.com Folder Name: Utilities, Electric: Retail Wheeling Relevance Score on Scale of 100: 53 To review or revise your folder, visit Dow Jones CustomClips or contact Dow Jones Customer Service by e-mail at custom.news@bis.dowjones.com or by phone at 800-369-7466.

Subject:: Curve Validation
Body:: ---------------------- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/HOU/EES on 04/20/2000 01:44 PM --------------------------- From: Vladimir Gorny@ECT on 04/20/2000 01:27 PM To: James D Steffes/HOU/EES@EES, Karen L Barbour/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott Stoness/HOU/EES@EES, Scott Gahn/HOU/EES@EES, Harry Kingerski/HOU/EES@EES cc: Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT, David Gorte/HOU/ECT@ECT, Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES Subject: Curve Validation Outlined below are some details of the existing curve validation process and its application to the proposed validation of tariff curves. Wholesale Curve Validation The existing process incorporates validation of all wholesale curves and includes monthly validations and random curve reviews. Every month, results of the validation are summarized in a memo and distributed to the Senior Management. Results of the random curve reviews are brought up to the attention of Desk Heads responsible for the respective curves and Senior Management as necessary. Curve Assessment Green: - curve is reasonable - small P&L impact from curve shift Yellow: - curve is illiquid - medium-to-large position and P&L impact from curve shift - some ability to validate prices from external sources Red: - curve mark is inaccurate (based on external data obtained) - curve is illiquid: no ability to validate externally - significant positions and P&L impact from curve shift Curves that are inaccurately marked based on data obtained from external sources are urged by the Senior Management to be corrected. In the cases where external data is not available or clear, the Senior Management urges the respective Desk Head not to increase an already large illiquid position or to built in a risk premium by widening the respective bid/offer spread and not to take on positions inside of that spread. Selection Criteria The criteria for monthly curve selection are the following: P&L sensitivity Largest positions Staleness (curves have not been marked for a period of time) Completeness (curves that have not been validated in a long time) The main criteria for random curve validation is new deals. Curve Validation Tools Broker Quotes/Other external data Graph Analysis (curve slope vs. a peer group, curve humps/sculpting vs. a peer group, curve shift vs. position shift, etc.) New Deal Analysis (comparison of curve marks and executed/quoted prices) Boundary Analysis/V@R Simulations (comparison of curve to simulated curve boundaries using Enron's V@R Engine) SAVA Model Comparison (comparison of curves to model generated results) Tariff Curve Validation Scope/Timing: ASAP - 20 curves with the largest positions related to deals pending review: (Frito-Lay, Quaker Oats, Starwood) - to ensure timely and smooth approval of these deals. Next 30-days - 20 curves with the largest positions/P&L impact Monthly/Quarterly - 20 curves selected based on criteria described above Randomly - curves with significant positions/P&L impact, resulting from new deals Data Gathering: This Month: Listing of 20 curves (related to deals in progress) and the related support requested by EGA (to be provided by Scott Stoness) On-going Basis: The process of obtaining data should be streamlined and the curve validation process should be relatively painless: - RAC should have access to the curve data (Minal Dalia is fully devoted to EES and is currently residing on the EES floor) - Curve assumptions should be documented (to be provided by Scott Stoness) Execution/Reporting: RAC, EGA and EES Risk Management Group work together on curve validation utilizing available tools and work on developing new tools Utilize the Wholesale Curve Assessment methodology (Green, Yellow, Red) Generate a curve validation report (see template attached) Provide feedback to the Desk Heads and distribute the Curve Validation Report to Enron and EES Senior Management Other Curves Other curves related to EES business should be gradually incorporated into the aforesaid process (ancillary services, congestion, DSM and labor related curves) - let us set a timetable. In conclusion, curve validation results should be evaluated in conjunction with other risk analytics: stress testing of prices, volatilities and correlations, Value-at-Risk/Capital-at-Risk analysis, performance measures, capital allocation framework, etc. Vlady.

LOS ANGELES -- In the latest attempt to fix California's troubled deregulated energy market, officials adopted a unique variable-pricing plan that already is being criticized by power generators and traders as unworkable and praised by utilities and consumers as much needed protection against gouging. Under the plan, adopted late last week by the governing board of the California Independent System Operator, or ISO, a quasipublic agency responsible for maintaining electricity reliability in the state, the cap on wholesale power will be reset hourly from about $65 per megawatt hour at low-demand times to no more than $250 an hour at periods of high demand. It was the third time this year that officials effectively lowered the price cap on wholesale electricity in a bid to contain -- so far unsuccessfully -- soaring total power costs. The move underscores the chaotic atmosphere prevailing in California's power market after a two-year-old experiment in deregulation has come undone. In other deregulated markets such as New York and New England, prices are capped at $1000 per megawatt hour, which are intended to be low enough to prevent market abuse but high enough to give generators incentive to build new plants. California's system was supposed to work the same way. But because utilities in California divested themselves of the bulk of their plants but weren't allowed to lock in fixed-price supply contracts, unlike in the other markets, merchant generators have had much greater sway over prices here on the spot market, where most power trades. During the first nine months of the year, the average price of wholesale electricity was $90 per megawatt hour in California, triple the price of a year earlier. Even on cool days in October, the price generally has remained above $100 per megawatt hour. California utilities have lost money on those power purchases because their customers' rates are frozen at $54 to $65 per megawatt hour, far lower than the average price utilities have had to pay for that power. The deficits exceeded $5 billion in the June-to-September period. California utilities buy the power used by their customers from the state-sanctioned auctions administered by the ISO and a sister organization, the California Power Exchange. In New York and New England, by comparison, less than 20% of power is purchased from the spot markets because utilities there were able to sign the fixed-price contracts, which California utilities weren't allowed to do. The price-cap decision passed last week by a vote of 13 to 10, primarily with support from utilities and board members representing consumer interests. It was pushed aggressively by Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, the state's two big investor-owned utilities that have gotten caught in the price-spike vise this year. Some ISO members say they had no choice but to support the measure to ratchet down price caps. ""We're going after the windfall profits,"" said S. David Freeman, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, who voted for the measure. ""What we've got now is a market accustomed to ripping off the consumer. This can't be allowed to go on."" But other experts said the hasty measure may make California's problems even worse. ""The short-term regulatory fix is always to fix prices,"" said Pam Prairie, director of the Institute of Public Utilities at Michigan State University in East Lansing. ""But there's a real danger you'll set prices too low and make your supply problems even worse."" Other economists agreed. ""At best, this is poorly administered cost-based regulation,"" said Frank Wolak, an economics professor at Stanford University who sits on an independent market-monitoring committee at the ISO. ""At worst, it creates all sorts of perverse market incentives."" For example, it may increase the problem of ""megawatt laundering"" on hot days in which in-state generators sell power to out-of-state customers who then sell it back into the state, effectively bypassing the cap. Likewise, it could encourage generators to build new plants outside of California, rather than where they are needed near its major cities, also to avoid the cap. In the end, it could increase stresses to the state's already overburdened transmission system. In fact, the decision already has brought to a halt the state's forward electricity market, which allows wholesale customers to sign contracts for power they will use in the future. The market had been trading as much as 1,000 contracts a week. On Friday, there was practically no activity. ""This decision shows the height of lunacy,"" said Rick Shapiro, a managing director at Enron Corp., the giant Houston-based energy trader. Mr. Shapiro said Enron and other generators will file appeals at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission asking that the new pricing formula be rescinded. It is possible the FERC may throw out the pricing formula anyway. It is expected to issue a major order on Nov. 1 directing changes in California's market structure. That order will include its determination of the effectiveness of price caps. It also is expected to judge the merits of the governance structure at the ISO, which has lately been marked by infighting. Recently, consumer groups have charged that the ISO board has put the business interests of its members ahead of members' fiduciary duty to California residents. The most recent price-cap measure was approved over the objections of executives at the ISO whose job it will be to implement the formula. ISO Chief Executive Terry Winter said the measure is flawed because it doesn't take into account the amount of power available to the California market. Mr. Winter fears the caps will place the state at a disadvantage relative to neighboring states with no price caps. About 11 states are electrically interconnected in the West, meaning power can be moved between them and chase the highest prices. ""We keep getting accused of making our market too complicated,"" Mr. Winter said. ""Then along comes this proposal"" with caps that would adjust repeatedly throughout the day, depending on demand.

Enron Offers Cash To Help Azurix Take Itself Private By Rebecca Smith Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/30/2000 The Wall Street Journal A12 (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) Enron Corp. offered to lend Azurix Corp., an Enron spinoff, $275 million so that it could take itself private. Enron, which has been frustrated with the global water company's performance, suggested Friday that public shareholders receive a cash offer of $7 a share for their Azurix stock. While nearly double the stock's value prior to the offer, the suggested price nevertheless was far below the $19 at which Azurix made its debut in 1999. An Azurix spokeswoman said the board, on which Enron has seats, had not yet decided how to treat the Enron offer. An Enron spokesman said that taking the company private would ""give us more opportunity to directly affect our investment."" In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Azurix soared $3 to $6.56 in heavy trading. Azurix had hoped to create a splash by doing to the water business what Enron had done to the energy business -- increase competition and provide trading skills capable of creating new financial products out of old commodities. But Azurix stumbled, nearly from the outset. Deregulation of the water business and government privatizations of water systems, on which it was counting, were slow to come, crimping growth opportunities and profit. And Enron, accustomed to higher, faster returns, grew impatient with the capital-intensive water business. The company's first chief executive, Rebecca Mark, a onetime head of Enron's international division, resigned in the summer with the agreement of Enron executives, who said it was time for new leadership. The incoming chief executive, John Garrison, said he would look for buyers for some of the company's businesses; he was unavailable to comment Friday. Ms. Mark was believed to be considering making an offer for some of those businesses, herself. She declined a request for an interview. In its letter to Azurix officers, Enron said the water company received four offers from prospective suitors after Ms. Mark's departure, the best of which came from an unidentified bidder who offered $7 a share and went through a lengthy due-diligence process before backing down, apparently spooked by Azurix's cash flow, capital structure, tax considerations and some securities litigation. In its proposal letter, made public Friday, Enron said it concluded ""that there is no other buyer willing to pay the $7"" and so proceeded with its own offer. But Enron said it won't try to limit Azurix's ability to negotiate a better deal with others, should they come forward. Finally, Enron noted that Azurix had considered various partial or full-liquidation alternatives but said they didn't seem likely to produce more than $7 a share.

Enron Offers Loan to Azurix Enron Corp. offered to lend Azurix Corp., an Enron spinoff, $275 million (327.6 million euros) so that it could take itself private. Enron, which has been frustrated with the global water company's performance, suggested Friday that public shareholders receive a cash offer of $7 a share for their Azurix stock. While nearly double the stock's value prior to the offer, the suggested price nevertheless was far below the $19 at which Azurix made its debut in 1999. (Staff) Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Business Wessex switch likely Adam Jones in New York 10/28/2000 The Times of London News International 2W 64 (Copyright Times Newspapers Ltd, 2000) Wessex Water's American parent company is likely to be taken private after a disastrous 14-month spell as a quoted company. Wessex, which provides water services to the South of England, was bought by Azurix in 1998 for Pounds 1.6 billion. Azurix wanted to use Wessex's expertise in privatised water supply to build a global business. However, since listing at $19 a share in June last year, Azurix stock has gone into freefall, closing at less than $4 earlier this week. Azurix slumped because it drastically misjudged the number of privatisation opportunities. It emerged last night that Enron, the Texan energy and trading company that is Azurix's biggest shareholder, has taken the unusual step of offering to lend Azurix $275 million (Pounds 190 million) to buy its publicly held shares, thereby taking it private. The Enron proposal would value Azurix at about $800 million or $7 per share - 63 per cent less than the IPO price. Enron would control Azurix and Wessex Water if it went private. Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. BUSINESS Enron water unit could go private under loan plan NELSON ANTOSH Staff 10/28/2000 Houston Chronicle 3 STAR 1 (Copyright 2000) Enron offered Friday to lend Azurix, its struggling water affiliate, about $275 million so Azurix can go private by purchasing 38.6 million shares that are publicly traded. The deal would have Azurix buying back its stock at $7 per share, about double what the shares were trading for Thursday. That's a big comedown for Azurix shares, which sold for $19 each when the Houston company went public in June 1999. The maneuver technically can be called a ""take-under,"" said analyst Carol Coale of Prudential Securities in Houston. She also described it as Enron's least painful solution for what to do with the venture that never lived up its ambitious plans. ""Nothing about Azurix has been positive for Enron, in my view,"" said Coale. ""This is a solution to a problem."" Azurix spokeswoman Diane Bazelides said its board is studying Enron's proposal. She added that it was too early to comment on the offer because the proposal's structure had not been outlined. Enron imposed no deadline for a decision by Azurix, but reserved the right to withdraw the offer if Azurix's position with prospective customers and employees deteriorated. One of Enron's conditions is that Azurix not sell any major assets before the buyout. The deal would not change Enron's large stake in Azurix, said Palmer. It owns a third, while the other third is owned by the Atlantic Water Trust, in which Enron owns a 50 percent voting interest. The proposal's advantages include giving public shareholders a premium to the market price, said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer. The common stock of Azurix zoomed Friday on the news, gaining $3 to close at $6.56 on the New York Stock Exchange. Becoming a private company would give Azurix management greater flexibility in restructuring. Coale said it would reduce Azurix's general and administrative costs, helping it to bid against lower- cost foreign competition, particularly two big French companies. Azurix's high cost structure has been its primary problem, she said. Azurix has been looking at cost and strategies ever since it got a new president and chief executive on Aug. 25, said Bazelides. That was the date that Rebecca Mark resigned as Azurix's high-profile chairman and chief executive. Enron and Azurix have been looking at ""strategic alternatives"" for nine months, J. Mark Meets, Enron's executive vice president for corporate development, said in a letter filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. One alternative was selling the company, he said. That didn't work out because the offers from three companies didn't exceed $4 per share. The fourth potential buyer said it would consider offering $7 per share, said Meets. But that suitor backed out, citing reasons like cash flow, complexity of the capital structure, tax considerations and pending securities litigation. ""We are obviously quite disappointed by this most recent turn of events,"" Meets said in the letter. ""However, we strongly believe that there is no other buyer willing to pay the $7 per share initially proposed (but later withdrawn) by the fourth bidder."" Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Ken Herman American-Statesman Capitol Bureau Chief 10/28/2000 Austin American-Statesman A1 (Copyright 2000) Not long ago, at a glossy wooden table in a Texas Capitol office, two of Gov. George W. Bush's high-level appointees discussed one of the key issues in state government these days. It involved the relative merits of White House posts that could be available to the two appointees if Bush becomes president. Asked this week whether it's a common topic around the Capitol, one of the appointees gestured to the anteroom of his office and made a motion indicating that even the midlevel folks have Washington on their minds. Near the banks of the Colorado, Potomac Fever is a near-epidemic. And though it is political faux pas to be too open about doing White House transition planning before Election Day, be assured it is going on at Bush headquarters, where top officials are cognizant of the fine line between looking too confident now and looking too unprepared later. The candidate himself -- as well as his top aides -- steers clear of transition talk. When asked who might wind up in his Cabinet, Bush looks backward instead of forward, saying that his selection of Dick Cheney as his running mate should offer a glimpse of the kind of people who would wind up in his administration. The transition work, such that it is, is under the aegis of longtime Bush friend and aide Clay Johnson, who began as head of the gubernatorial appointments office and now serves as chief of staff. Johnson said nobody has been interviewed for any Washington post, but he has compiled a file of folks who are interested in serving in a Bush administration. Johnson also has been reading up on previous transitions -- ones that went well and ones that didn't. His preliminary conclusion is that the outgoing administrations are generally helpful and supportive, even if they were ousted by the incoming administration. It's the incoming administrations that can make the mistakes, he said. There is no shortage of think tanks that have think-tanked the topic. Back in August, the Heritage Foundation, based in Washington, issued a transition handbook titled ""The Keys to a Successful Presidency."" ""Though we really don't expect either campaign to talk about it (and would discourage them from doing so), the message here is it's time to start planning for a possible presidential transition, quietly, well behind the scenes, but with the understanding that the preparation done during the next 70 or so days, and the work done in the 70 or so days that follow (between the election and the inauguration) will very well determine the initial success or failure of the next administration,"" Herbert Berkowitz, a foundation vice president, said in releasing the study. All indications are that the Bush team has been following the advice, with Johnson at the helm. Johnson cautions against expectations that a Bush administration would be overloaded with Texans. ""It's the United States of America, not the United States of Texas,"" he said. Despite that caveat, there is no shortage of Texans who are considered shoo-ins to fill some of the thousands of slots Bush could offer if he wins. Johnson confirms that he is very interested in a Washington job. Early speculation among Bush aides makes Johnson a potential leading contender for head of personnel at the White House. Karen Hughes, Bush's communications director since his 1994 gubernatorial campaign, is expected to become Bush's press secretary if he wins the White House. Karl Rove, Bush's longtime political guru, also will be on board, though he could wind up with an out-of- the-White-House post, perhaps at the Republican National Committee. Not as certain is the potential future for Joe Allbaugh, who is part of the ""iron triangle"" of top advisers -- along with Rove and Hughes -- who have been on board with Bush since the 1994 campaign. Allbaugh serves as manager of the presidential campaign and previously served as chief of staff in the governor's office. Capitol speculation indicates Allbaugh could decide to skip a White House post, possibly in favor of a lobbying job, if he is not tapped as chief of staff. That post could go to Don Evans, a longtime Bush friend who headed the megasuccessful fund-raising effort for the presidential campaign. However, not everyone has Potomac Fever. For example, Terral Smith, Bush's legislative director, said he will stay in Austin to lobby. In addition to the speculation about appointees, the approaching election has sparked talk about when Bush might leave office if he wins. Under the U.S. Constitution, he could remain governor until he has to become president on Jan. 20. Much more likely, however, is that Bush would leave office sooner than that, perhaps as soon as two or three weeks after the Nov. 7 election, if he wins. That could cause a housing problem for Bush, whose main residence is the Governor's Mansion, which comes as a free perk of the job. The Bushes have a home under construction at their ranch in Crawford, near Waco. The ranch also has a smaller house in which the Bushes now spend weekends. Not out of the question is that Bush could work out an arrangement with Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, who would become governor if Bush resigns, to remain in the Governor's Mansion for several weeks after he leaves office. If the race among Texas senators to replace Perry as lieutenant governor complicates the timing of the resignation, Bush could stay in the governor's office a little longer, but no later than the first week of January. After all, he will want to give Perry time to bask in his gubernatorial inauguration before the Legislature convenes Jan. 9. No matter when Bush resigns, confidantes believe he might use his Crawford ranch for interviews with potential top-level appointees, including Cabinet members.

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A Dynegy executive said Friday that the California Independent System Operator's plan to impose hourly price caps on the wholesale power market will compromise reliability by forcing generators to sell electricity out of state. ""If the ISO says it will not buy above a certain price and generators cannot operate below that price, then we have no choice but to find other markets to participate in,"" said Dynegy senior vice president of marketing and trading asset management Lynn Lednicky. ""That may lead to the ISO not finding the power it needs at a price it wants to pay."" The ISO plans to construct hourly price caps each month based on forecast load, natural gas prices and generation unit efficiency. The caps will take effect Nov. 3 or soon therafter. Dynegy Inc. (DYN) sent a letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission asking it to address reliability consequences of the price caps before Nov. 3. Dynegy specifically requested that FERC discuss the issue at its Nov. 1 meeting, when it will release a report on California's electricity problems. Enron Corp. (ENE) and Southern Company (SO) share Dynegy's concerns about reliability and plan to petition FERC about the issue, said a trader listening in to a conference call between the three companies. -By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872; jessica.berthold@dowjones.com Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. SEC Filing Shows 3rd Parties Contacted Enron About Azurix By Christopher C. Williams 10/27/2000 Dow Jones News Service (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES New York -(Dow Jones)- Shares of Azurix Corp. (AZX) jumped 84% in heavy trading Friday after parent Enron Corp. (ENE) proposed to take the company private in a $7-a-share buyout. Filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed that Enron made the proposal after not being satisfied with offers it had received from four third parties for its stake in Azurix. In a letter to two members of Azurix's board, Enron said three potential buyers ""were unlikely to be willing to pay more than the then-current market price of approximately $4 a share."" Enron said a fourth potential buyer indicated it would consider a $7-a-share offer, but it said that proposal was recently withdrawn. ""The reasons given by the bidder included pro forma cash flows, the complexity of the capital structure, tax considerations and the currently pending securities litigation,"" the letter said. Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Houston-based Enron, declined to say whether Enron was entertaining current third-party interests or was in any talks with other parties regarding its Azurix stake. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Azurix ended Friday up $3 to $6.56 on 2.8 million shares, compared with average daily volume of 239,000 shares. Enron was up $1.38, or 1.8%, to $78.88 on 1.6 million shares, compared with its daily average turnover of 2.4 million. In the SEC filing, Enron, saying it's familiar with Azurix's various partial and full liquidation alternatives, said its buyout proposal is conditioned upon Azurix not selling any significant assets prior to the buyout. ""Although we agree that such plans may result in greater value to Azurix's shareholders than the maintenance of the status quo, we believe that these options almost certainly will not result on a present value in a greater return to Azurix's shareholders than $7 a share,"" the letter said. Enron also said its buyout proposal doesn't include any breakup fees or other ""deal protection devices."" This frees Azurix's board to pursue an acquisition that ""might provide greater value"" to shareholders. Daine Bazelides, a spokeswoman for Azurix, declined to say whether Azurix is now entertaining offers for the company. She did, however, confirm the information contained in Enron's filing. ""The historical information in the filing is factually correct,"" she told Dow Jones Newswires. She said she doesn't know when Azurix board will respond to Enron's proposal. In the filing, Enron didn't set a deadline, but warned that Azurix's position with customers and employees may deteriorate further. ""We must therefore reserve the right to withdraw our proposal at any time,"" Enron's letter said. In the letter, Enron pointed out that Azurix had retained two ""internationally recognized investment bankers"" early this year to evaluate strategic alternatives, which included the potential sale of the company to unrelated third parties. Enron said it strongly believes there isn't another buyer willing to pay $7 a share for Enron's indirect interest in Azurix. ""We believe it is in Azurix's best interest, as well as the best interest of its shareholders and employees, if Azurix were no longer a publicly traded company,"" Enron said. -By Christopher C. Williams, Dow Jones Newswires, 201-938-5219; Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Enron offers to buy out Azurix Financial Times By Hillary Durgin in Houston Published: October 27 2000 23:31GMT | Last Updated: October 27 2000 23:36GMT Enron, the Houston-based energy and trading group, said on Friday it had offered up to $275m in funding to take Azurix private at a buy-out price of $7 per share. The specific structure of Enron's proposal has yet to be determined, Enron said. Azurix said its board would now consider the proposal. The timing of any decision was unclear. Enron owns directly and indirectly about 66 per cent of Azurix, the troubled Houston water company, whose main asset is UK-based Wessex Water. The buyout offer is the latest development in a history of problems at Azurix, which was spun off from Enron and taken public at an offering price of $19 per share. But a combination of poor market timing, competitive industry conditions and empty promises by the company on Wall Street took their toll on the company, whose shares have since plummeted and have been trading most recently around the $3-per-share range. In August, Rebecca Mark, Azurix chief executive officer, resigned both from Azurix and from the board at Enron. Enron's offer came after four unnamed parties approached Enron about buying its stake in Azurix. While three of the four were unwilling to pay more than the then market price of about $4 per share, a fourth party who was considering offering $7 per share (before accounting for any dilution for stock options) later declined to pursue the transaction, Enron said in Friday's letter to Azurix, outlining the buyout proposal. ""We strongly believe that our proposal is fair to Azurix's public stockholders,"" the letter stated. ""Our proposed transaction would permit Azurix's stockholders to receive, on a timely basis, a cash payment for their shares that is significantly above the price at which those shares have traded in several months."" Analysts that follow Azurix and had valued the shares at between $6 and $8 per shares said the offer was fair. Analysts that follow Enron said that Azurix's business strategy had proved to be a failure and was characteristic of the hard asset approach that Enron has gradually distanced itself from. Enron's shares closed at $78.88 up $1.38 on Friday. Azurix's shares rose $3 to close at $6.56.

Subject:: RE: Refund Cases Timelines--Confidential Atty Client Work Product
Body:: The DC Team (Linda Robertson, Ray Alvarez) attended and reported on today's prehearing conference in the California case. The schedule has moved back about a full month mostly due to the time required by PX and CAISO to produce mitigated market clearing prices and to re-run settlements based on those revised prices. Testimony by Enron on what it is owed is now not due until October 26. In addition to adopting this schedule, the ALJ reported that the FERC likely not rule on petitions for rehearing of the July 25 order until October 15, 2001. A revised schedule is attached. (To see how it has changed, you can toggle Track Changes | Hightlight on Screen on and off) The PNW case is moving along on schedule; changes attached are corrections rather than actual changes to the schedule. Notably in today's case, Seattle and Tacoma waived all cross on TFG witnesses, including Enron's.

Its chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, a big contributor to the Republican Party, pr= ovided political influence, while its former chief executive, Jeffrey K. Sk= illing, helped create markets for the trading of electricity and natural ga= s. But last winter, when California's effort to deregulate the electricity = market led to soaring power prices and rolling blackouts, Enron was the sub= ject of much criticism and political anger.=20 Recent disclosures of discrepancies in Enron's financial statements and an = investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission caused the shares t= o plunge this week to their lowest level in a decade. As other companies be= came wary of doing business with it, Enron -- also facing a potential cash = squeeze -- apparently had little choice but to find a buyer, and a deal was= hastily cobbled together this week.=20 For critics who had complained about Enron's market power and its dominance= , the combination poses additional concerns. Dynegy's acquisition of Enron = will be reviewed by state and federal agencies, led by the Justice Departme= nt and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Analysts said today that t= hey expected scrutiny of the combined companies' holdings in California, wh= ere Dynegy owns power-generating plants and Enron accounts for much of the = trading of natural gas -- fuel for the state's electric power plants.=20 Buying Enron at a deep discount -- it has lost $60 billion in market value = this year -- could make Dynegy the dominant trader of electricity and natur= al gas. But the agreement carries big risks as well. Along with Enron's gas= pipelines and high-technology trading floor, Dynegy will take on Enron's s= ubstantial debt and a web of complex transactions that Enron has spun over = the last decade.=20 In addition to the $13 billion in debt that Enron carries on its books, it = has guaranteed at least $4 billion in off-balance sheet loans, and the hidd= en debt could total as much as $10 billion, said Carol Coale, a stock analy= st with Prudential Securities.=20 Charles L. Watson, Dynegy's chairman and chief executive, said yesterday th= at Dynegy could sort through Enron's tangled finances. ''We know the compan= y well,'' Mr. Watson said. ''It's not like we just started fresh. I'm confi= dent that it's as solid as we thought it was.''=20 The new company will combine Enron's 25,000-mile natural gas pipeline syste= m with the large number of power plants that Dynegy owns worldwide, as well= as Illinois Power, a Dynegy subsidiary that serves 650,000 customers in Il= linois. But its most important asset will be its trading desk. It will be t= he largest energy trader in the nation, trading more than twice as much pow= er and natural gas as its closest competitors.=20 Mr. Watson said the company did not expect to sell significant properties a= nd that the deal should pass regulatory scrutiny. ''There's really not a lo= t of overlap in assets,'' he said.=20 Mr. Watson and Steve Bergstrom, Dynegy's president, will hold those positio= ns in the new company, which will be called Dynegy and remain in Houston. M= r. Lay, who created Enron in the mid-1980's, will not have any role in the = combined company's daily operations. He has been asked to join its board bu= t has not provided an answer. ''The last three weeks haven't been a lot of = fun,'' he said.=20 In a statement announcing the agreement yesterday afternoon, Mr. Watson sai= d he was confident that the merger would produce a strong new company. ''En= ron is the ideal strategic partner for Dynegy,'' Mr. Watson said. ''We will= keep a strong balance sheet and straightforward financial structure as key= priorities.''=20 To shore up Enron's finances, Dynegy will immediately put $1.5 billion into= Enron through ChevronTexaco, the giant oil company, which already owns 27 = percent of Dynegy. Another billion dollars will be injected once the deal i= s completed.=20 Investors appeared comfortable yesterday that Dynegy could make the deal wo= rk. After falling $3, to $33, on Wednesday, when the companies first said t= hey were in discussions, Dynegy rose $5.76 on Thursday and yesterday to clo= se the week at $38.76.=20 ''On paper, it works,'' Ms. Coale of Prudential said. ''The combined compan= y would be the leading trader, the market leader in most of their businesse= s.'' Ms. Coale, who has a sell rating on Enron and a buy rating on Dynegy, = said she planned to keep her buy rating on Dynegy.=20 As it works to have the deal approved, Dynegy will have to persuade Enron's= traders to stay with the combined company. The pain of the stock's 90 perc= ent plunge this year will not be equally shared. Some Enron employees have = held onto their shares and seen their retirement accounts eviscerated. Mean= while, Mr. Lay, Mr. Skilling and other former and current executives sold h= undreds of millions of dollars in Enron stock in 2000 and this year.=20 The companies also have very different corporate cultures. Dynegy emphasize= s teamwork, while Enron is more competitive, said Ehud Ronn, director of th= e Center for Energy Finance Education and Research at the University of Tex= as. Even before the merger was announced, Enron had lost some of its employ= ees to other energy trading companies, Mr. Ronn said.=20 Some investors and analysts say that the problems with Enron's finances may= extend beyond the partnerships that have been the subject of Wall Street's= scrutiny the last month. James Chanos, a short-seller who has been one of = Enron's most vocal critics, said there was increasing evidence that Enron's= energy trading operations were not as profitable as the company had said. = ''There appears to be a culture at Enron of aggressively booking profits an= d deferring or obscuring losses,'' Mr. Chanos said.=20 On Thursday, Enron said in a filing with the S.E.C that it had overstated i= ts earnings by almost $600 million over the last five years. Mr. Chanos sai= d more restatements were possible, noting that the filing disclosed partner= ships had been used to hedge almost $1 billion in losses in 2000 and this y= ear. So far, the losses from those partnerships remain off Enron's financia= l statements, Mr. Chanos said.=20 Enron's stock had been under pressure for most of this year, as the company= ran up large losses with failed efforts to expand outside its core trading= operation. In August, Mr. Skilling resigned as chief executive, and Mr. La= y resumed control of daily operations.=20 Still, the company appeared financially sound until last month, when it dis= closed that its shareholders' equity, a measure of the company's value, dro= pped by $1.2 billion because of deals disclosed only hazily in its financia= l statements. The announcement unnerved investors, who wondered whether Enr= on had found ways to inflate its profits and move debt off its balance shee= t, and led the S.E.C. to begin an investigation.=20 Mr. Lay tried to reassure investors that Enron's finances were in order and= that its businesses remained strong. But the last three weeks have brought= a series of damaging revelations about partnerships that Enron formed with= some of its top executives, including its former chief financial officer, = Andrew S. Fastow.=20 With questions mounting, the major credit-rating agencies began to downgrad= e Enron's debt, putting additional pressure on the company. If Enron's debt= rating falls below investment grade, it would be forced to repay $3.3 bill= ion in loans that it had guaranteed.=20 To strengthen its balance sheet and bolster its stock, Enron turned to big = investors like Warren E. Buffett in search of billions of dollars of financ= ing. When the financing did not quickly appear, its stock fell further.=20 By this week, some major energy traders were refusing to extend credit to E= nron, worrying that the company would be unable to make good on its contrac= ts. The Mirant Corporation, an Atlanta-based power plant owner and electric= ity trader, sharply curtailed its trading with Enron this week. ''We're tra= ding with them on a very limited basis,'' said James Peters, a Mirant spoke= sman. ''It's not business as usual.''=20 On Wednesday, Enron's stock fell as low as $7 a share, its lowest level in = more than a decade. That day, news of the Enron and Dynegy talks leaked out= .=20 By late Wednesday, the boards of the two companies had tentatively agreed t= o a deal. But Dynegy refused to go ahead until it learned whether Enron's c= redit rating would remain investment grade and was comfortable with the eff= ect of the deal on its own rating. The deal moved forward yesterday after D= ynegy was assured Enron's debt was not in danger of being lowered to junk s= tatus soon after the deal was announced, according to company officials.=20 Dynegy and Enron had provided Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Servi= ce, the main credit agencies, with statements showing them what a combined = company might look like and asked the ratings agencies for an expedited rev= iew of the transaction, Mr. Watson said.=20 Under the deal, Enron shareholders will receive 0.2685 share of Dynegy stoc= k for each Enron share, or $9.80 based on Dynegy's closing price on Thursda= y. Enron's stock gained 22 cents yesterday, to $8.63.=20 ''I never thought our stock price would be at this level,'' Mr. Lay said ye= sterday.=20 Enron's shareholders will own only 36 percent of the combined company, and = Dynegy will name at least 11 members of the company's 14-member board.=20 If the deal falls apart, Enron or Dynegy will have to pay a breakup fee of = $350 million.=20 To protect Dynegy's and ChevronTexaco's cash infusion, the money will go to= an Enron unit that owns the Northern Natural Gas Pipeline. If the merger i= s not completed, Dynegy will have the right to buy the unit.=20 An army of bankers and lawyers advised the companies. Lehman Brothers Inc. = acted as financial adviser and Baker Botts and Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &= Feld acted as counsel for Dynegy. J. P. Morgan & Company and Salomon Smith= Barney acted as financial advisers for Enron, and Vinson & Elkins and Weil= Gotshal & Manges acted as the company's counsel.

OPPEL Jr. 11/10/2001 The New York Times Page 1, Column 2 c. 2001 New York Times Company WASHINGTON, Nov. 9 -- For years, the Enron Corporation used its political m= uscle to build the markets in which it thrived, pushing relentlessly on Cap= itol Hill and in bureaucratic backwaters to deregulate the nation's natural= gas and electricity businesses.=20 Its achievement, as one Enron executive said today, in creating a ''regulat= ory black hole'' fit nicely with what he called the company's ''core manage= ment philosophy, which was to be the first mover into a market and to make = money in the initial chaos and lack of transparency.'' Now, Wall Street's dissatisfaction with Enron's secretive ways has delivere= d the company into the arms of its much smaller Houston rival, Dynegy Inc.,= in a deal worth about $9 billion in stock and the assumption of $13 billio= n in debt. The combination of the two companies, energy experts and lawmake= rs said today, poses a novel set of challenges for regulators still struggl= ing to grasp the complexities of the marketplace that Enron invented.=20 ''We're in a supersonic-speed era of electronic trading with a horse-and-bu= ggy-era regulatory system to protect consumers,'' said Representative Edwar= d J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who has devised legislation to close = the regulatory gap.=20 Dynegy's acquisition of Enron is expected to be reviewed by numerous state = and federal agencies, led by the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Comm= ission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.=20 Analysts said today that sharp scrutiny would be given to the combined comp= anies' holdings in California, where Dynegy owns generating plants and Enro= n controls a large part of the market for trading natural gas -- the fuel f= or a big share of the state's electric power plants.=20 ''Dynegy would now have a greater ability to take the dominant position in = gas and raise the price of electricity,'' said Frank Wolak, a professor of = economics at Stanford University.=20 Mr. Wolak, a consultant to the Justice Department on a 1999 antitrust case = that led to limits on another merger of electricity and natural gas compani= es in Southern California, said he was skeptical that regulators were up to= the task of reviewing today's deal.=20 The transaction ''is something the Department of Justice needs to look at, = and they are going to have a hard time looking at,'' Mr. Wolak said. ''And = it's beyond the ability of the F.E.R.C. to look at.''=20 Pat Wood -- named chairman of the federal energy commission earlier this ye= ar with the backing of Kenneth L. Lay, the chairman of Enron -- acknowledge= d in an interview today that the agency had ''a long way to go'' in matchin= g the sophistication of the companies it regulates.=20 But he said that the commission had made great strides in grappling with th= e new risk management techniques pioneered by Enron, Dynegy and other energ= y companies. It is hiring more experts, he said, adopting more restrictive = rules on how much ''market power'' one party can control and requiring more= disclosure of certain energy transactions.=20 In an interview this evening, Charles L. Watson, the chairman of Dynegy, sa= id he did not believe that regulators reviewing the deal with Enron would r= equire the sale of any assets. ''We haven't really identified any pitfalls = that require any sort of asset divestiture,'' he said. ''There's not really= any overlap.''=20 A senior executive at one of Enron's largest energy-trading rivals disagree= d. ''I don't think this deal gets through unscathed,'' he said today. ''I'm= sure the Justice Department and the F.T.C. will look closely at the pretty= substantial concentration of market power these companies will have in the= energy-trading area.''=20 Enron is mainly a trader of natural gas and electricity -- indeed, the bigg= est player in both those markets -- and it also owns a network of gas pipel= ines. Dynegy processes and sells natural gas and generates and sells electr= icity. Each company owns a local electric utility, too: Dynegy owns Illinoi= s Power in Decatur, Ill., while Enron owns Portland General Electric in Por= tland, Ore., but last month announced plans to sell it to another Oregon ut= ility.=20 For a decade, as it transformed itself from a gas pipeline operator into th= e nation's biggest energy trader, Enron enjoyed unalloyed lobbying success = in Washington and the enthusiastic backing of Wall Street.=20 In the early months of the Bush administration, Mr. Lay -- whose company wa= s one of the biggest financial backers of George W. Bush's presidential cam= paign -- played a prominent, and some said unusual, role in helping the Whi= te House pick nominees to the federal energy commission. Enron executives m= et with Vice President Dick Cheney, whose energy task force backed many of = the deregulatory initiatives pushed by Mr. Lay.=20 Now, ''the company has become a pariah,'' an Enron executive said today. ''= The Bush administration doesn't want to have anything to do with us.''=20 The problems began with the energy crisis in California, where Enron's outs= poken defense of deregulation, even more than its electricity trading activ= ities, made the company a favorite whipping boy of politicians and consumer= advocates. In the financial markets, meanwhile, Enron's confusing disclosu= res, tolerated when its stock was soaring, drew disdain as the calming of t= he energy storms in California and other parts of the country beat the shar= es down, starting last spring.=20 ''Enron fell victim to their own inconsistencies on transparency,'' Mr. Wol= ak said. As California officials sought to understand why energy prices had= soared out of control, he said, Enron's ''view was that we want everybody'= s data, but if you want ours, get a subpoena.''=20 Energy executives and regulators said that sort of arrogance had long marke= d Enron's attitude about government oversight.=20 Electricity sales had for decades been the job of local utility companies, = operating as monopolies and selling power at regulated rates within their s= ervice areas. A few entrepreneurs, led by Mr. Lay, conceived a different mo= del in which power could be sold by generators or middlemen to big corporat= e users or utilities in faraway regions, at whatever price the market would= bear.=20 In the early 1990's, Congress -- under heavy lobbying by Enron -- passed le= gislation that began to open up electricity sales to marketers. Before long= , Enron became one of the first companies to receive government approval to= sell electricity at market rates. The market for interstate sales of natur= al gas had been freed up a few years earlier, and critics complained that t= raders like Enron were gleaning their profits by stoking volatility in gas = prices.=20 In the mid-1990's, independent gas producers backed legislation in Congress= to allow the creation of a co-operative marketing organization, which, the= y hoped, would have helped stabilize prices.=20 Raymond Plank, the chairman of the Apache Corporation, a gas producer based= in Houston, said that the big gas marketing and trading companies, includi= ng Enron, successfully lobbied to kill the plan, leaving prices as volatile= as ever.=20 ''It was a great concept,'' Mr. Plank said. ''We could have headed off the = problems we have today.''=20 Enron's final lobbying success came last year. With a strong push from the = company's lobbyists, Congress passed futures trading legislation that exemp= ted Internet energy trading platforms like EnronOnline, the industry leader= , from oversight by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Enron takes t= he other side of trades on its exchange. In traditional markets like the Ne= w York Mercantile Exchange, which remain subject to oversight, the exchange= acts as a middleman between buyers and sellers.=20 Under Mr. Watson, Dynegy has been less of a pathbreaker than Enron, and tho= ugh California politicians denounced it, too, as a profiteer during the ene= rgy crisis, most analysts say it has been less aggressive than Enron in bot= h its business practices and its lobbying.=20 Indeed, the rival energy-trading executive today predicted ''a huge culture= clash'' as the Houston neighbors merge. ''Blood will flow in Houston over = the integration of the trading operation,'' he said.=20 But regulators may find Dynegy easier to deal with.=20 Earlier this year, the federal energy commission asked for comments on whet= her it should tighten scrutiny of dealings between natural gas pipelines an= d energy-trading shops owned by the same company.=20 Enron wondered what all the bother was. ''Would stricter rules prevent real= affiliate abuse that current rules do not,'' it wrote in a regulatory fili= ng, ''or would they instead merely restrict the activities of some of the m= ore successful participants in the marketplace?''=20 Dynegy, by contrast, painted a grim picture and invited regulators to crack= down. ''Abuses abound,'' it said, ''because of financial windfalls, diffic= ulty of detection, lengthy investigations and increased complexity of the m= arket.'' Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved THAL LARSEN.=20 Dynegy last night agreed a rescue bid of about $7.8bn for Enron, after the = rival energy group narrowly escaped having its credit ratings cut to junk s= tatus. If successful, the all-stock bid will allow Dynegy to take over a pioneer o= f energy trading that is many times its size in the electricity and gas mar= kets, while also providing urgently-needed liquidity to the fallen star.=20 Dynegy offered almost 0.27 of its own shares per Enron share. Dynegy's stoc= k closed at $38.76, up 6.2 per cent, yesterday, valuing the bid at $7.8bn, = or 21 per cent above Enron's closing price. Enron was up 2.6 per cent at $8= .63.=20 The combined company will also receive an immediate cash injection of $1.5b= n from ChevronTexaco, which owns 27 per cent of Dynegy, and a further $1bn = from ChevronTexaco when the deal closes.=20 The infusion is expected to avert a funding crisis caused by Enron's fallin= g trading volumes and its customers' demands for collateral which followed = a series of blows to its reputation.=20 Dynegy will use the $1.5bn infusion to acquire preferred stock collateralis= ed by Enron's pipeline assets; in return ChevronTexaco will be granted righ= ts over $1.5bn of Dynegy stock.=20 JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup demanded similar security for a $1bn loan ext= ended this month.=20 Moody's Investors Service cut its rating on Enron's senior unsecured debt y= esterday morning from Baa2 to Baa3 - just one notch above junk status. Any = deeper downgrade would have forced Enron to sell stock to cover about $3.3b= n of obligations, and could have deterred Dynegy. Moody's kept the ratings = under review for further downgrades, given ""the potential for increased mar= gin requirements from counterparties"".=20 However, the agency said it would treat a substantial capital injection as = ""a stabilising event"". The deal is likely to face intense regulatory scruti= ny, given the large share the combined companies would have in the energy m= arkets.=20 The bid represents a reversal of fortune for Enron, which will effectively = be humbled by its smaller Houston rival. However, some analysts expressed r= eservations, as Enron faces a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry in= to off-balance sheet transactions, and a restatement of its accounts has ye= t to clear up questions about the true state of its financial dealings.=20 Carol Coale, of Prudential Securities, said: ""We believe that either Dynegy= had material exposure to Enron's trading contracts or that it is trying to= rescue its competitor by saving the liquidity in the commodities markets.""= =20 Reporting by Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson and Robert Clow in New York, Sheila = McNulty in Houston and Peter Thal Larsen in London ..

All Rights Reserved COMPANIES & FINANCE INTERNATIONAL - Company troubles leave Houston with a p= roblem - Energy trader has played a vital role in its home city, writes She= ila McNulty.=20 When Sam Soliman, senior vice-president of Koch Industries, the second-larg= est privately held company in the US, remarked earlier this year on the bui= lding boom in downtown Houston, he could not help but be alarmed about the = city's prospects: ""I always get worried when I see a lot of new constructio= n."" He was right to be so circumspect. In a matter of months, three of Houston'= s corporate landmarks - Compaq Computer, Continental Airlines and Enron - h= ave come under pressure.=20 Compaq is in the process of being acquired by Hewlett-Packard; Continental = has had to lay off 12,000 employees; and energy trader Enron has gone from = being the leader of Houston's business community to its biggest liability.= =20 The fourth most populous city in the US is reeling from the latest demise a= mong its corporate citizens.=20 ""It's a body blow,"" says Charlie Savino, executive vice-president of the Gr= eater Houston Partnership, a business organisation.=20 Enron is not only one of the city's biggest employers; it has led the redev= elopment of downtown Houston, making it somewhere pleasant to live for the = first time in decades.=20 At the centre of its efforts is the Enron Field, which the company financed= to bring professional baseball - and its fans - back into the city centre.= =20 On the periphery are Enron's contributions to Houston's social development.= =20 The company matches all employee donations made to non-profit organisations= , for up to $15,000 per employee, per year.=20 It also makes donations to non-profit organisations for which its employees= offer their time.=20 Kenneth Lay, Enron chief executive, has long been the ""go-to guy"" to get so= mething done in Houston.=20 Enron's status brought Houston status; as the biggest energy trader in the = US, it made the city the centre of energy trading. EnronOnline, its interne= t trading platform, has drawn some of the brightest minds to the city to wo= rk on what has become the world's biggest web-based transaction system.=20 Enron was so secure in its standing that it was building a new 40-storey of= fice building adjoining its 50-storey tower.=20 Beside that, bulldozers and cranes have been putting the finishing touches = to a massive new parking garage.=20 Employees had just started to move into the new towers when a series of dis= closures about Enron's financial position began to undermine the company an= d send investors fleeing for cover.=20 Enron staff, once known for being both brilliant and arrogant enough to pro= ve it, are coping with their dramatic reversal in status in a wide variety = of ways.=20 As they left work yesterday, many brushed by in their smart-casual polo shi= rts and khakis, refusing to say a word about what was unfolding.=20 One man, looking exhausted, braved a grin and said: ""Just keep smiling. The= world goes on. Companies go through problems all the time, just like we do= in personal life.""=20 One woman felt she had to laugh at the irony: she moved to Enron last year = to protect herself from job losses in the more traditional energy businesse= s. At that time, Enron was considered the safest place to be in the industr= y.=20 That Dynegy, another Houston-based energy trader, has emerged as Enron's sa= viour is being received positively by staff, who praised its technology and= processes.=20 The Houston business community may be hoping that a merged group might be b= etter for the city than a stand-alone Enron, as a combined business would b= e bigger and stronger.=20 But John Olson, of Sanders Morris Harris, a local investment banking and se= curities firm in Houston, notes that a merger is likely to lead to job loss= es, as assets are sold and businesses are streamlined.=20 Already, he says, many Houston citizens, big holders of Enron's stock, had = lost out on its share slide.

The purchase will end Enron's reign as the world's largest energy trader, c= atapulting a company to the top that in many ways has been in Enron's shado= w.=20 ""This could be viewed as Dynegy being the savior of industry in rescuing En= ron, the largest energy trader, and restoring market liquidity,"" said Carol= Coale, a stock analyst with Prudential Securities in Houston, who follows = both companies.=20 A much bigger Dynegy - with annual revenues exceeding $200 billion and $90 = billion in assets including pipelines and power plants - will emerge with C= huck Watson, its current chairman and chief executive, keeping those roles = in the combined company.=20 Layoffs are expected, but executives said it was too early to say how many.= Dynegy has almost 1,600 employees in Houston; Enron has more than 7,000 he= re.=20 For Watson, the deal is all about growth.=20 ""It accelerates our strategy some three or four years,"" he said shortly aft= er the deal was announced. ""This is just a financial bonanza really for bot= h companies.""=20 This isn't the way Ken Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, ever thou= ght his years of work would turn out.=20 ""This would not have been my dream case,"" Lay said in an interview with the= Chronicle shortly after the deal was announced. ""I would not even have con= templated it three or four weeks ago.""=20 Lay has been offered a seat on the combined company's board, but hasn't dec= ided yet whether to take it. He won't have any management role once the dea= l closes.=20 He helped take Enron from a staid pipeline company created from a 1985 merg= er to a trading machine that wheels and deals in gas, electricity, financia= l contracts used to help companies manage risk and other commodities.=20 But Lay said he believed selling Enron was the best option for its sharehol= ders, employees and the city considering the company's current battered sta= te.=20 ""This is the best way to provide certainty to protect this wholesale market= ing and trading franchise which is so valuable,"" he said, adding that Enron= looked at two or three other alternatives as it tried to strengthen its ba= lance sheet and add cash into its operations.=20 Lay said it's not his preference to sell Enron and see its name disappear.= =20 ""It happens to be the best alternative,"" said Lay. ""I'm a realist. I knew w= hat needed to be done.""=20 Among Enron's troubles: The Securities and Exchange Commission is investiga= ting business deals Enron did with two investment partnerships run by its f= ormer chief financial officer, its credibility on Wall Street is close to z= ero, a pile of shareholder lawsuits and its credit rating, which it relies = on to successfully run its core trading business, has been lowered.=20 While other questions had hung over Enron earlier this year, the path to it= s end really began Oct. 16, when the company released third- quarter earnin= gs and reported significant financial losses related to the two investment = partnerships.=20 That set in motion a spiral of events leading to Friday's announcement.=20 Watson called Lay on Oct. 24 to see if he could do anything to help dispel = rumors that Dynegy had stopped trading with Enron.=20 That conversation led to a meeting at Lay's house three days later, at whic= h the two started talking about a deal.=20 As these things go, the deal came together quickly, especially with so many= question marks hanging over Enron.=20 ""I think it's important to understand that Ken and I have known each other = for some 20 years,"" Watson said. ""We have a good understanding of what they= do and how they do it. We knew that their franchise was solid.""=20 Under the terms of the deal, which is expected to close in six to nine mont= hs:=20 Enron shareholder's get 0.2685 share of Dynegy per Enron share. Based on Fr= iday's closing stock prices of $8.63 for Enron and $38.76 for Dynegy, Dyneg= y is paying $10.41 an Enron share - or a 21 percent premium. That's a far c= ry from late January when Enron's closing price hit $82 a share.=20 Dynegy will immediately inject $1.5 billion in Enron to help shore it up. D= ynegy will get that money from ChevronTexaco, which owns about 26 percent o= f Dynegy.=20 In return for that money, Dynegy will get preferred stock and other rights = in Enron's Northern Natural Gas pipeline system. Should the deal not close,= Dynegy has the right to buy all of Northern Natural Gas.=20 At the deal's closing, ChevronTexaco will provide another $1 billion to the= combined company.=20 Enron will have the right to designate at least three board members for the= combined company, which will have 14 board seats.=20 Steve Bergstrom, Dynegy's president, and Rob Doty, Dynegy's chief financial= officer, will keep those roles in the new company. Greg Whalley, currently= president and chief operating officer of Enron, will become an executive v= ice president at the combined company.=20 The deal contains a $350 million breakup fee that Dynegy would get if anoth= er suitor came in and Enron decided to take a better offer.=20 Watson also said the deal contains escape clauses to protect Dynegy should = it be necessary, but he doesn't expect any surprises.=20 ""We looked under the hood and guess what, it's just as strong as we thought= it was,"" he said.=20 The deal must be reviewed by a variety of government regulators, though Wat= son isn't expecting any antitrust problems.=20 Dynegy will talk to analysts and investors on a conference call Monday, att= empting to convince them of the deal's value. Dynegy expects the merger to = result in $400 million to $500 million in annual savings.=20 ""On paper, it looks good,"" said Coale, the analyst. ""We still remain concer= ned about the uncertainties that shroud Enron . . . The risks continue to b= e what we don't know about Enron. We just hope Chuck and his team do all th= e necessary due diligence, which is going to take more than a couple weeks.= ""=20 There are also concerns about merging two different cultures.=20 ""Looking at cultures, the two companies are very different,"" she said. ""Dyn= egy is a little bit of a fraternity. Chuck started this company and I'm sur= e he has a heartfelt emotion toward making things work at Dynegy. Enron is = a mercenary, aggressive, cutthroat culture.""=20 While both are energy traders, Enron has pursued a strategy of shedding ass= ets, while Dynegy has continued to make asset purchases.=20 At the start of the year, Enron was still heralded as an innovator for othe= rs to emulate. Since, a series of problems began chipping away at Enron's i= mage.=20 But such concerns were mostly pushed aside for as long as the company's sto= ck price performed well and its core energy trading business turned out hig= her and still-higher profits.=20 The company's woes became more serious and quickly multiplied after it made= troubling financial disclosures in its third-quarter earnings report Oct. = 16.=20 It disclosed that day it had taken a $35 million loss and reduced sharehold= ers equity by $1.2 billion related to ending business dealings with two inv= estment partnerships formerly run by Andrew Fastow, its chief financial off= icer.=20 The disclosures heightened Wall Street's ongoing concerns that Enron's fina= ncial reporting was too difficult to understand and skimped on details. It = also led to fears that Enron would be on the hook for billions of dollars r= elated to other financial vehicles.=20 Days later, Enron revealed that the SEC was investigating transactions betw= een Enron and the partnerships, called LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-investment. I= t also replaced Fastow and has been hit with a growing number of shareholde= r lawsuits.=20 Then, the company's credit rating was downgraded, which raised questions ab= out its ability to manage its core energy trading business.=20 As Wall Street's questions grew, Enron retreated into silence, leaving anal= ysts and investors to speculate on worst-case scenarios, which fed fears th= at company was facing a cash-crunch and caused investors to keep dumping th= e stock.=20 That in turn, led some of Enron's trading partners to shift business elsewh= ere and raise their credit requirements to do business with Enron, which in= turn, raised even more fears.=20 Thursday, Enron said it is restating its finances as far back as 1997 to in= clude losses related to a number of complex partnerships it created.=20 . . .=20 DEAL AT-A-GLANCE=20 Company name: Dynegy.=20 Key players: Chuck Watson, Dynegy's current chairman and CEO, will remain c= hairman and CEO.

All Rights Reserved. =09 BUSINESS POWER PLAY / Lay opened energy firms to work in new markets MICHAEL DAVIS Staff 11/10/2001 Houston Chronicle 3 STAR 3 (Copyright 2001) THE famous baseball manager Casey Stengel was smart to advise, ""Never make = predictions, especially about the future,"" Ken Lay once wrote in an essay o= n world energy needs.=20 Lay might be taking those words to heart today. As the chairman of Enron Corp. predicted not long ago, ""We can see some ver= y significant growth with several years to come.""=20 Once considered one of the shining stars of the energy business, Lay has wa= tched the company he helped create melt down around him in a matter of week= s.=20 And as of Friday, he was left to ponder an offer to serve as a member of th= e board for the new company formed from Enron and its chief rival - no long= er a chairman or a chief executive.=20 Perhaps that's the way he wants it.=20 When he turned over the chief executive's post at Enron to Jeffrey Skilling= earlier this year, it seemed like the first move of his orderly exit from = the company he had helped create in the mid-1980s.=20 Eleven months later, Skilling is gone and Lay has had to preside over the d= eath of Enron.=20 What had begun as a stodgy natural gas pipeline company had been molded and= expanded by the two men into a diversified financial giant with its hands = in countless markets from oil and natural gas to water and broadband.=20 It seemed Lay, 58, who is an economist by profession, had also cemented his= reputation as an elder statesman in the energy industry, the man who had o= pened the business world's eyes to the array of possibilities that energy c= ompanies could explore for growth away from their traditional roles.=20 With the implosion of Enron in the past month, Lay's legacy now seems tarni= shed. The man who was once referred to as an ""energetic messiah"" has been f= orced to sell off his creation in a fire sale to rival Dynegy in a hastily = arranged deal. Lay's approach is reflected in the design of the building En= ron is constructing across from its existing tower on Smith Street. Looking= down on the massive trading floor are two offices built for Lay and Skilli= ng.=20 The offices were considered symbolic of the company's openness and its phil= osophy of melding executives with the rank and file. Lay reportedly spurned= the express elevator to ride to his 50th-floor office to spend more time w= ith employees.=20 That sort of hands-on approach Lay brought to the company may be another ca= sualty, analysts said.=20 ""I would be surprised if he had much of a role in running things from a day= -to-day perspective,"" said Brian Youngberg, energy analyst with Edward Jone= s in St. Louis. ""I think Dynegy will be running the ship and plug in some E= nron executives.""=20 As the dust settles on Enron, the question is being raised as to whether th= e company became too big for one or two men to run in a hands-on fashion.= =20 ""Ken Lay helped build Enron from being just a pipeline company, but over ti= me the company got so big and complex that it was too hard for one or two s= enior executives to completely oversee things and to know fully what was go= ing on in the operating companies,"" Youngberg said.=20 Raised on a farm in Missouri, Lay is well-known not just as chairman of Enr= on but as a former undersecretary of the Interior Department and one of the= people who has helped shape Houston's destiny in the past 20 years. He is = considered instrumental in keeping Major League Baseball in Houston by supp= orting the construction of Enron Field.=20 But his lasting legacy will likely be as one of the key people who helped c= reate the huge natural gas futures market in the United States, which was n= onexistent as recently as the late 1980s. He also will be remembered as the= man who led others to view the energy business as one integrated market an= d not individual fiefdoms.=20 ""Ken Lay really did educate his peers to understand the broadness of his bu= siness,"" said Amy Jaffe, a senior energy analyst with Rice University's Jam= es A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy. ""Whether his retirement is und= er positive or negative circumstances, he has left a huge legacy on the ind= ustry.""=20 Jaffe sees Lay as the person who got oil and gas executives to break out of= the old mentality and explore new technologies such as fuel cells and wind= power. He also was a leading proponent of natural gas and power deregulati= on.=20 He will leave Enron a wealthy man, although much less so since the company'= s stock nose-dived. His current contract pays him a base salary of $1.4 mil= lion a year and a bonus of $7 million. It was due to expire in December 200= 3.=20 This is not the first time Lay has had to rescue Enron. In 1987, Enron was = rocked by the disclosure that rogue traders at its Enron Oil Co. had left t= he company holding the bag for about $1 billion in trading liabilities. Bef= ore disclosing it to the market, the company worked the trading loss down t= o about $142 million.=20 ""We learned a lot, certainly in a bad way,"" Lay said of the incident in an = interview earlier this year. ""We put in place probably the best risk manage= ment and control system, not just in our business, but in any industry.""=20 Some see irony in the fact that Dynegy CEO Chuck Watson will likely prevail= over Lay despite Lay's almost cult status among business leaders and busin= ess school professors.=20 ""Chuck Watson was underrated in his role in forming the natural gas market = in the United States. He was the man who realized the enormous potential of= the natural gas market,"" Jaffe said. ""It's true that Enron came in with a = lot of advertising and built up a big position, but maybe there is some poe= tic justice that the man who really started the natural gas clearinghouse c= ould wind back up as the dominant player in the industry.""=20 ...=20 THE PLAYERS=20 1985-present: Enron Corp., various top management posts, currently chairman= and CEO 1984-1985: Houston Natural Gas Corp., chairman and CEO 1981-1984 T= ransco Energy Co., president and chief operating officer Board memberships:= Compaq Computer Corp., Eli Lilly & Co. and Trust Company of the West Educa= tion: University of Missouri, master's degree, economics, 1965: doctorate, = economics, Membership: Energy Advisory Board secretary; National Petroleum = Council member Photo: Ken Lay=20 Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

He steers clear of the political arena and the limelight of the cit= y's big social soirees. He doesn't live in River Oaks, but lives in the sam= e neighborhood near Champion's Forest where he's lived for years. When they donated $1 million worth of land for the relocation of his church= , Windwood Presbyterian, Watson and his wife, Kim, tried to donate anonymou= sly.=20 ""We talked about that a lot, and they reluctantly agreed that it wouldn't t= ake a rocket scientist to figure out who in this congregation would be able= to do something like that,"" Senior Pastor Kevin Rudolph said.=20 When fellow church member Merle Davidson recently offered to let Watson dri= ve a luxurious new Bentley for a weekend, Watson readily agreed.=20 ""He enjoyed the car,"" said Davidson, general manager of Post Oak Motor Cars= . ""But when I asked him, `Should I order you one?' he shook his head.""=20 ""I don't know if I could drive such a high-profile car,"" Watson said.=20 It's not that Watson objects to a fancy ride; he drives a top-of- the-line = Mercedes. But he's not a showboat and isn't comfortable attracting attentio= n to himself.=20 ""He doesn't act like a big shot,"" said Tilman Fertitta, the chairman of Lan= dry's Restaurants, who likes driving a Bentley and zipping around in a heli= copter. ""Chuck's not all caught up in the Houston hustle-and-bustle thing.""= =20 Like it or not, Watson is about to step out in a big way. If Dynegy complet= es the acquisition of Enron for $8.85 billion in stock, Watson will become = captain of Houston's largest company. He will step right into the center of= the city's business stage, taking from Enron Chairman Ken Lay the mantle o= f most powerful businessman in a city where commerce and the deal have alwa= ys come first.=20 Those who know Watson say he should have little trouble adapting to his hig= her profile and is ready for the many demands that will inexorably follow.= =20 ""Chuck is a guy who knows what he wants and goes and gets it,"" Fertitta sai= d. ""He is not intimidated.""=20 In fact, when longtime friend Steve Patterson read about Enron's nose-dive = and the collapse of its stock, he instinctively knew Watson would close in = on a deal.=20 ""I thought: `You know what, Chuck will try to buy Enron. It just fits. It's= the big bold move that Chuck would try to make,' "" said Patterson, senior = vice president of the Houston Texans football team. Watson owns 15 percent = of the Texans, the largest chunk outside of the piece owned by club founder= Bob McNair. Watson also owns the Houston Aeros hockey team.=20 Like Enron Chairman Ken Lay, Watson was a pioneer in the deregulation of th= e energy business. He was one of the early innovative forces that shaped th= e world of trading electricity and swapping natural gas.=20 Watson was born 51 years ago on the Great Lakes naval base north of Chicago= . His father worked for the Navy, which moved the young Watson clan around = early and often. Chuck Watson had attended more than 20 schools in nine sta= tes when he graduated from Oklahoma State University in 1972 with a degree = in economics.=20 After a 13-year career at Conoco, Watson joined a fledgling company called = U.S. Natural Gas Clearinghouse in 1985. NGC was a consortium of gas pipelin= es that had the backing of a financial- services company and a local law fi= rm, but conflicts among the partners hamstrung the little company.=20 Watson would not join the company until it was overhauled and most of the q= uarreling partners were bought out. Watson's vision was to buy the gas and = take title to it, aggregate big volumes and leverage that to make bigger de= als and negotiate better rates from the pipelines that moved the gas around= .=20 In short, the company moved beyond being a broker and became a wholesale st= ore for natural gas.=20 ""He is a visionary in the energy business,"" said Bob McNair, a longtime fri= end who founded Cogen Technologies and later sold the company to Enron for = $1.1 billion. ""Chuck will come across as this relaxed, country person. Not = some sophisticate. But that is disarming. He is very creative, and he is ve= ry smart.""=20 While NGC initially concentrated on gathering, moving and trading natural g= as, the business has broadened along with the quickening pace of energy der= egulation. Now called Dynegy, short for Dynamic Energy, the company has evo= lved into an outfit that sells power directly to commercial and industrial = users of electricity and natural gas. It also has built a communications di= vision to capitalize on increasing demand for high-speed communication serv= ices.=20 Last year the company recorded an astounding 230 percent rise in net income= , as well as a 91 percent jump in operating revenues. Dynegy's stock climbe= d 218 percent last year.=20 ""The success of Dynegy is a tremendous story,"" Patterson said. ""It is amazi= ng the growth and the value he has been able to achieve.""=20 According to some of those who've have done business with him, Watson is no= t just bright, he is extraordinarily tough.=20 ""He is a very aggressive person, a tough negotiator. He bores in,"" said Geo= rge Mitchell, founder of Mitchell Energy and the man who carved The Woodlan= ds out of the piney forest.""He is a very confident person. Unlike Ken Lay, = who is a smoother type personality who works with people, Watson is going t= o do it his way. They are both very good business people, but they are very= different.""=20 While willing to give power to his subordinates, Watson is a hands- on CEO = who is unmistakably Dynegy's commanding force.=20 ""Chuck is very, very intense . . . He burns,"" said former Houston Mayor Bob= Lanier. ""In negotiations, he gets down and learns all the details himself.= ""=20 How tough Watson is willing to be came to light in his contentious dealings= with Houston Rockets owner Les Alexander. Watson owned the master lease to= the Summit, later renamed the Compaq Center, which committed the Rockets t= o playing there through 2003. Eager to break the deal, Alexander tried nego= tiating and litigating his way out of the lease, all to no avail.=20 The battle deepened as the two men competed unsuccessfully to get a NHL hoc= key team in Houston and feuded over how a hockey team would share in the re= venues of a new stadium proposed for downtown.=20 Angered at the deal Alexander was able to get for the Rockets, at the expen= se of a hockey franchise, Watson spent about $100,000 out of his own pocket= to help defeat the stadium referendum. It was his one overtly political ac= t here, and some say it was the decisive blow to Alexander's aspirations.= =20 ""There are a lot of people I'd much rather have a contest with,"" Lanier sai= d of Watson.=20 Alexander and Watson were later able to settle their differences, and Watso= n supported the second arena referendum, which passed.

As rumors and news about the Dynegy buyout leaked out Friday, many of those= who gathered around the base of the Enron Tower to smoke were worried abou= t their fate.=20 Several worried about their job prospects during a time when the economy ap= pears to be sinking into a recession and job losses are mounting across the= nation.=20 Others were concerned that Enron is such an innovator and their jobs so uni= que that they'll have a hard time finding an equivalent job somewhere else.= =20 Many were angry that company officials had made the financial missteps that= got the company into its precarious situation.=20 And others were just unnerved by the uncertainty.=20 ""See you Monday hopefully, bro,"" shouted one Enron employee to another acro= ss its tree-lined plaza.=20 Once the buyout was announced late Friday afternoon and it became clear lay= offs would be coming, one employee seemed to feel a bit better.=20 ""It's a relief to know what's going on,"" she said, asking not to be identif= ied. And, like many, the employee who works on Enron's trading floor was no= t just thinking of her job. Like so many others, her retirement account was= mostly invested in Enron stock.=20 The employee, who asked not to be identified, said she figured her retireme= nt account, lost about $100,000 in value over the past few weeks as Enron s= tock plummeted in value.=20 She even encouraged her college-age children to invest their college funds = in Enron stock. It's all gone now, she said, and that was money they'd need= in the next two years.=20 Jamie Lynn, a 29-year-old coordinator of gas logistics, figured that he los= t close to $400,000 in stock options. But others employees lost millions, h= e said.=20 ""It makes me sick to my stomach,"" Lynn said.=20 While the money losses hurt, he is also feeling badly because he loved his = job - and company - so much.=20 ""People walked around downtown with a swagger,"" he said. ""They were proud t= o say they worked at Enron.""=20 Lynn can't imagine finding another company with such an exciting culture an= d with such exciting challenges.=20 ""I don't want this company to be owned by someone else,"" he said.=20 But if it had to be sold, he was hoping Shell Oil Co. would be the buyer. S= hell isn't in any of the same lines of business as Enron and they'd have to= depend on Enron employees to keep the place running.=20 While Lynn is lucky because he is already being recruited by other companie= s, other employees were not as upbeat about their opportunities. Several in= formation technology employees such as programmers and software designers w= ere especially worried.=20 The general market for information technology isn't very good right now and= they worried whether Dynegy would need their services.=20 ""Maybe I'll have to pack up and go back home,"" said a software developer fr= om India who is working at Enron on a visa.=20 A programmer discussed her prospects while she waited for a bus.

Tears filled one employee's eyes as she wait= ed for a ride. Others were too upset to comment. Part of that stemmed from = the feeling that senior executives ran the company arrogantly and for their= own self-interests.=20 When the deal was announced, employees began to turn their minds to more im= mediate details, such as severance packages.=20 In the past, Enron has been generous, an employee said.=20 ""Let's hope that tradition continues,"" she added.=20 . . .=20 DEAL AT-A-GLANCE=20 Company name: Dynegy.=20 Key players: Chuck Watson, Dynegy's current chairman and CEO, will remain c= hairman and CEO.

NANCY RIVERA BROOKS; THOMAS S. MULLIGAN; NANCY VOGEL TIMES STAFF WRITERS 11/10/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition A-1 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company Enron Corp., the once-highflying energy giant whose aggressive efforts to p= rofit from California's energy deregulation made it a target of consumer an= d political backlash, on Friday agreed to be saved from possible financial = collapse through a proposed acquisition by rival Dynegy Inc.=20 The roughly $7.7-billion deal is a stunning plot twist for Houston-based En= ron, which was vilified in California as it was being glorified on Wall Str= eet. In only the last month, a series of disturbing financial revelations p= ushed to the edge of ruin this once-powerful company, whose top executives = had lectured California on its energy foibles and who influenced the direct= ion of national energy policy. Enron muscled its way to the top of the energy heap using aggressive and, i= n the end, financially suspect strategies that proved its undoing.=20 Now, the company that late last year had a market value of $63 billion is w= orth one-tenth that and has agreed to be swallowed by a cross-town competit= or one-quarter its size. Enron's proud and influential chairman and chief e= xecutive, Kenneth L. Lay, who became a focus of bitter attacks by Californi= a politicians and regulators, would lose his job, as would many others at E= nron.=20 Even the name would disappear. The combined company would be called Dynegy = Inc. if the deal receives all the necessary regulatory and shareholder appr= ovals.=20 California officials took no joy in Enron's fate Friday, though there was p= erhaps some sense of retribution from its many critics in the state.=20 ""This is basically a rogue corporation,"" said Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon)= , an outspoken critic of Enron for years who dealt with the company as he c= haired the committee that hammered out the legislative portion of Californi= a's landmark electricity deregulation plan in 1996. ""It has from the beginn= ing been a rogue corporation which answered in its mind to a higher law--a = fundamental belief that there are laws of economics that supersede the law = of the land.""=20 A Failed Experiment=20 Steve Maviglio, spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, said that although Enron was= never a major force in California's doomed electricity market, it was outs= poken in support of deregulation.=20 ""In a sense, their experiment was much like California's experiment--a fail= ure,"" he said.=20 Said Harvey Rosenfield, president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consum= er Rights in Santa Monica: ""Nothing could better illustrate the disaster of= deregulation than the fact that one of its biggest proponents, which reape= d the reward of deregulation, is suffering the consequences.""=20 Enron is the world's largest energy trader, handling one of four energy dea= ls in the United States through its online trading operation, EnronOnline. = Since it reported a surprising third-quarter loss on Oct. 16, partly tied t= o shadowy investment vehicles, Enron has endured a huge loss of investor co= nfidence, which brought on a massive cash crunch and some shrinkage of its = trading business.=20 Under the deal announced Friday, Dynegy, invited in two weeks ago after Enr= on fell short in its efforts to line up new financing, would immediately he= lp Enron by pouring $1.5 billion in cash into the company. The money would = be provided by ChevronTexaco Corp., the San Francisco oil company that owns= nearly 27% of Dynegy.=20 Enron shareholders would get 0.2685 Dynegy share for each Enron share, whic= h values the company at about $7.7 billion based on Friday's stock close. D= ynegy shares surged $2.26 to close at $38.76 per share on the New York Stoc= k Exchange; Enron added 22 cents to close at $8.63 per share, still off 89%= year to date.=20 If the deal closes in six to nine months, as the parties expect, Dynegy and= ChevronTexaco would invest $1 billion additionally in the combined company= .=20 ""This is just a financial bonanza really for both companies,"" said Charles = L. Watson, Dynegy chairman and chief executive, who will head the combined = company. Watson said the merger would immediately add to Dynegy's earnings.= =20 Even so, the repercussions of Enron's fall from grace could be far-reaching= . Coming on the heels of California's energy crisis, Enron's troubles may s= low the country's march toward energy deregulation, which Lay and Enron cha= mpioned for years as a potential boon to consumers and the economy in gener= al.=20 But the deal announced Friday will prevent an even worse outcome, energy ex= perts said: the threatened collapse of Enron, which would clog up for a tim= e the business of buying and selling electricity, natural gas and oil. That= could interfere with delivery of energy around the country, they said.=20 ""This is an encouraging development for the energy industry,"" said Stephen = Baum, chairman of Sempra Energy, the San Diego-based parent of Southern Cal= ifornia Gas and San Diego Gas & Electric. ""The Enron-Dynegy combination wil= l create a credit-worthy counter-party which will help preserve order in th= e marketplace. It also will reinforce confidence in the energy trading busi= ness going forward.""=20 But some in the industry are less pleased.=20 Raymond Plank, chairman of Apache Corp., a Houston-based natural gas explor= ation and development firm, said he is considering a motion to the Federal = Trade Commission against the proposed merger.=20 ""There are issues of concentration in a combination of the largest energy t= rader, Enron, and the fifth-largest, Dynegy,"" Plank said. ""California shoul= d be particularly concerned because Dynegy owns power plants there and Enro= n has pipelines and other interests.""=20 Troubles Mount as Stock Plunges=20 The swagger that was Enron is long gone. Consider:=20 * Enron's brash chief executive, Jeffrey K. Skilling, touted only months ag= o as one of the young stars of American business, abruptly resigned in Augu= st, citing personal reasons. Enron's stock already had fallen from its high= of nearly $90 per share as investments in water and telecommunications tur= ned sour, a fact that contributed to Skilling's departure.=20 * The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched an investigation of E= nron's controversial dealings with a number of limited partnerships, some o= rganized and run by Enron managers, including Enron Chief Financial Officer= Andrew S. Fastow, who was ousted last month.=20 * In an extraordinary confession Thursday, Enron announced that it had over= stated profit by $586 million, or 20%, during the last five years. The earl= ier financial statements reported to Wall Street and the investing public, = Enron said, ""should not be relied upon.""=20 * The company also fired its treasurer and a corporate lawyer, both of whom= it said were investors in one of the limited partnerships. Yet some analys= ts questioned whether, even in its admission of accounting trickery, Enron = wasn't still holding something back.=20 * Credit-rating agencies, which already have downgraded Enron's bonds to ba= rely above ""junk"" status, continue to pore over Enron's books. Analysts hav= e said a further downgrade to the level of junk, or below investment grade,= could precipitate a crisis akin to a run on a bank and threaten Enron's su= rvival while the merger is pending.=20 With its stock crumbling and trading partners leery about its ability to pa= y its debts, Enron was forced to walk hat in hand down Houston's Energy All= ey to negotiate a saving takeover by Dynegy, the rival once jokingly dismis= sed as ""Enron Lite.""=20 In the trading markets where Enron still holds a leading but increasingly v= ulnerable position, other players already are stepping up to grab a bigger = share of the business. Even if Enron's trading operation survives more or l= ess intact, under the wing of a Dynegy or some other company, experts said = it may never regain its former level of dominance.=20 ""Enron has been a very innovative shop, willing to spend considerably to es= tablish new markets,"" said analyst Andre Meade of Commerzbank Securities in= New York. ""If that culture is not kept, everyone loses.""=20 Skilling and mentor Lay had worked for a decade to create both a new kind o= f company and a new set of markets for it to play.=20 In large part, they succeeded. Enron transformed itself from a traditional = gas pipeline company into a high-tech global trader of everything from elec= tricity to pollution credits to aluminum. The company's overarching strateg= y was to pare its physical assets to the minimum to get the maximum profit = bang from its intellectual capital: the ranks of MBAs and PhDs that filled = its Houston trading floor.=20 Rather than maintain its own expensive gas fields and power plants--which i= t relegated to stodgy utilities and oil companies--Enron would handle every= thing by contract, relying on a network of suppliers to obtain, store and d= eliver the goods while the company focused on squeezing out the best price.= =20 Dynegy, in contrast, has invested in such energy assets, including three po= wer plants in Southern California. It uses those assets to back its trading= operation, which is much smaller than Enron's.=20 Enron pulled off a migration from the ""dirty"" extreme of the oil patch, the= asset-intensive domain of drillers and explorers, to the ""clean"" end, wher= e all the deals are done on a computer screen. It also was a migration from= lower profit margins and lower risk to high margins and high risk.=20 Shannon B. Burchett, chief executive of Risk Limited Corp., an energy-orien= ted strategic-management consultancy in Dallas, compared Enron to the inves= tment bank Salomon Bros., where he used to work in the former PhiBro commod= ities unit.=20 Enron, Burchett said, embodies ""a Wall Street culture that happens to be in= Houston.""=20 Wall Street certainly ""got it,"" or thought it did.=20 Accounting Rules Pushed to the Limit=20 At Enron's zenith last year, when its stock peaked near $90 a share and it = was pushing into esoteric markets for weather derivatives and fiber-optic b= andwidth, Enron seemed to be a one-company wave of the future.=20 Enron's aggressiveness, brainpower and willingness to back radical new idea= s with serious capital helped it acquire an aura that in some ways was its = undoing, analysts said.=20 Investors accorded Enron's stock a price-to-earnings valuation that was con= sistently higher than those of its peers, reflecting the view that its cutt= ing-edge business model could consistently deliver faster-growing profit th= an its competitors.=20 To keep profits arcing ever upward to justify the outsize valuation, Enron = began pushing the accounting rules as hard as it pushed competitors in the = trading arena. It acknowledged as much in its statement Thursday, conceding= that the operations of three of the limited partnerships should have been = consolidated with Enron's own financial statements instead of being held se= parate.=20 By raising capital and running deals through the limited partnerships, Enro= n could keep large amounts of debt and certain volatile assets off its own = balance sheet, while simultaneously booking profit from the partnerships' t= ransactions, analyst Meade said.=20 Deals Backed by Costly Guarantees=20 One risky aspect of some of Enron's deals through the partnerships was what= Meade called a ""double-trigger guarantee,"" under which Enron would pledge = a cash payout if either its bond rating fell below investment grade or its = stock declined below a certain price.=20 The guarantees must have seemed a cheap way to sweeten a deal when Enron's = stock was flying high, but they came back to haunt the company later, when = it had to pay cash to make good on its obligations, Meade said.=20 Other energy-trading companies use similar devices, but Enron carried it to= an extreme and disclosed too little detail to make the process understanda= ble to investors, he said.=20 Enron's magic, like that of the Internet-stock phenomenon, had never been e= asy to understand in the first place. The company had a reputation among an= alysts for providing scanty financial detail and hard-to-grasp explanations= of some of its dealings.=20 But as long as the reported profit kept climbing, Enron kept getting the be= nefit of the doubt.=20 M. Carol Coale, a respected Houston-based analyst for Prudential Securities= , ruefully recalled a time last winter when she told Enron she could find ""= no positive catalyst for the stock"" and was considering downgrading her inv= estment opinion.=20 Skilling telephoned Coale and asked her to hold off, promising her that the= re was unspecified good news on the horizon that would justify her faith.= =20 ""I believed him,"" Coale said last week in an interview in Houston. She held= her rating steady at that time but has since downgraded Enron to an outrig= ht ""sell.""=20 Instead of Skilling's promised good news, questions mounted during the spri= ng, and Enron's stock continued a steady decline. Coale and other analysts = were troubled that a large proportion of Enron's earnings seemed to come no= t from its core trading operations but from unusual transactions involving = the company's own stock or that of affiliates.=20 In California, Enron played a key role as chief cheerleader for electricity= deregulation and a key energy middleman in the state. As wholesale electri= city prices soared and the state plunged into its energy crisis late last y= ear, Enron and other out-of-state electricity generators and traders became= favorite targets of California politicians and regulators, who said the co= mpanies were manipulating the market and charging too much for power.=20 But significantly, California was not a directly successful territory for E= nron.=20 Markets in water did not develop as Enron subsidiary Azurix envisioned. And= Enron's plans for selling electricity to retail customers were deferred ev= en as deregulation took effect in 1998 because the state's deregulation for= mulas didn't allow room for retail competition.=20 Lay complained about California frequently and met with the governor to try= to influence the state's moves to repair its energy problems. In an interv= iew in his Houston office in January--overlooking Enron's new headquarters = building, which is still under construction as the company's name disappear= s--Lay said he and other Enron executives had objected to the way Californi= a regulation was set up.=20 ""We objected more vehemently than anyone. We opposed the concept of the poo= l,"" he said, referring to the now-defunct California Power Exchange, in whi= ch most of the state's power was bought and sold in an hourly market. ""What= competitive market in the world has a pool? We don't buy our groceries thr= ough a centralized PX.""=20 Enron also backed away from building a small power plant in California last= year when the state imposed price caps.=20 One of the loudest complaints by Davis and other California officials was t= hat generators of electricity were playing ""games"" to get higher prices.=20 They criticized Enron severely, too, even though it was not a major generat= or, because the level of its worldwide trading operations--buying and selli= ng contracts worth billions of dollars in electric power every day--gave En= ron immense sway over pricing and supplies of electricity. They also believ= e that Enron and Lay helped play a part in the reluctance of federal regula= tors for several months to place restraints on the California marketplace.= =20 CEO's Future Role Uncertain=20 ""Millions of people in California businesses lost money because this rogue = company succeeded in controlling the government of the United States,"" said= state Sen. Peace, one of the architects of the state's deregulation plan.= =20 ""Ken Lay was a mystic,"" Peace said. ""Whatever he said had to make sense bec= ause he was Ken Lay. It was hero worship.=20 ""Many of the people working as economists at the Federal Energy Regulatory = Commission worshiped Ken Lay. As a consequence, the things Enron promoted a= nd pushed for were never challenged, intellectually and otherwise.""=20 Lay, who has been asked to sit on the board of the combined company, said F= riday that he had not yet decided whether to accept.=20 He described his time building Enron as ""a very long ride.

All Rights Reserved Embattled Enron Corp. yesterday accepted a buyout offer valued at about $8 = billion from crosstown rival Dynegy Inc. If the deal is completed, it would= end Houston-based Enron's reign as the leader in the huge energy trading m= arkets that set the prices of power and natural gas in the nation.=20 Its cash dwindling and its credit rating hammered, Enron was forced to the = negotiating table after its recent disclosures that its obligations to a co= mplex web of partnerships involving company officials had caused the tradin= g powerhouse to overstate its earnings and obscure its total debt obligatio= ns. Four top Enron officials have resigned or been replaced since July and,= once Dynegy takes control, Enron's chairman and chief executive, Kenneth L= ay, will also leave the company. Lay said yesterday that he had not decided= whether to accept Dynegy's offer to serve on the combined company's board. ""It's been a good ride for a long time,"" Lay said in a conference call last= night. ""The last three weeks haven't been a whole lot of fun.""=20 The final deal was announced after the close of stock trading. Enron's shar= es -- which had fallen from $33 to $8 after the disclosures -- ended the da= y slightly higher, at $8.63. Dynegy's stock closed at $38.76, up $2.26.=20 Dynegy offered all stock for the Enron shares, so the total value of the de= al will fluctuate with Dynegy's stock price. Dynegy also said it would assu= me about $13 billion in Enron debt, bringing the total value of the transac= tion to around $21 billion.=20 Dynegy's rescue of Enron will begin with an immediate cash infusion of $1.5= billion, which will be supplied by ChevronTexaco Corp., a major Dynegy sto= ckholder. ChevronTexaco will invest another $1 billion in Dynegy after the = acquisition has passed regulatory review and is completed, which executives= said they expect will take six to nine months as Enron tries to unscramble= the complex partnerships that are now under investigation by the Securitie= s and Exchange Commission.=20 The takeover agreement gives Dynegy an escape clause permitting it to cance= l the purchase if Enron winds up with heavy regulatory fines or legal judgm= ents from shareholder suits tied to its handling of the partnerships.=20 Chuck Watson, Dynegy's chairman and chief executive, said in the conference= call that a close scrutiny over the past two weeks of Enron's financial co= ndition convinced him that the company's trading and pipeline businesses we= re solid. ""We looked under the hood, and guess what? It looked just as stro= ng as we thought it was."" Watson said he did not think more damaging disclo= sures were forthcoming from Enron.=20 Until the partnership mess, Enron was the nation's dominant energy trader, = and it had front-door political connections to the White House. Lay, its lo= ngtime chairman, raised more then $100,000 for the presidential election ca= mpaign of his friend George W. Bush. Enron rode the growth of energy tradin= g markets beginning in the mid-1990s, as first natural gas, and then electr= ic power sales were deregulated at the wholesale level. Its revenues leaped= from $9.2 billion in 1995 to $100.8 billion last year.=20 During those heady times, the Houston company could choose which questions = to answer about its dealings with related partnerships and its Byzantine bo= okkeeping.=20 ""It was always very difficult to get information,"" said Louis B. Gagliardi,= an analyst with John S. Herold Inc. ""They would always rebuff you.""=20 Until this fall, the muscular company seemed too big to stumble, said inves= tment manager David Coxe, with Harris Insight Equity Fund in Chicago.=20 Coxe bought 78,000 shares of Enron at $40 a share in August, after wrestlin= g with the decision for months, he said. Then Jeffrey Skilling, Enron's chi= ef executive and strategic mastermind, unexpectedly resigned. The stock, wh= ich had been as high as $90 in August 2000, pitched downward.=20 ""Enron seemed so indispensable to the nation's energy markets that I though= t it inconceivable it could implode,"" Coxe said. ""That's how I got sucked i= n.""=20 Enron's fall is ""classic hubris,"" Coxe said: a Greek tragedy striking someo= ne who chose to defy the gods -- ""in this case, the rules of the system.""= =20 Among the rules that Enron now acknowledges it didn't follow were the accou= nting standards that applied to the complex partnerships it created. The pu= rpose of the partnerships, Enron said, was to reduce the risks of investmen= ts in Internet transmission systems and to sell power plants and other asse= ts it no longer wanted.=20 The accounting errors were described in a 20-page SEC filing Enron made Thu= rsday. The errors resulted in a $1.2 billion reduction in the value of shar= eholders' equity. The company also said it had overstated its earnings by $= 586 million since 1997.=20 Enron created partnerships that would buy major assets -- such as a power p= lant -- that Enron wanted to sell, or in other cases, assets such as fiber-= optic cable networks that Enron intended to run but did not want to have on= its balance sheet.=20 The partnerships had outside investors, but the general partner of two of t= hem was Enron's own chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. He earned $30 m= illion in fees from managing two of the largest partnerships, according to = the SEC document.=20 Enron added to the capital of these partnerships by pledging its stock, or = securities convertible into stock. Some of those stock transactions should = have been counted as loans, resulting in the $1.2 billion drop in sharehold= er equity, Enron now says.=20 Investors are asking why Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, did not insi= st that these transactions be handled that way in the first place. Enron's = SEC filing mentions but does not explain some ""proposed audit adjustments"" = over the past four years that were overruled.=20 Even though, as Enron now acknowledges, it created an information barrier, = masking critical information and violating standard accounting rules, many = financial analysts who were recommending the stock to investors were not pu= shing hard enough to punch through that barrier, some analysts acknowledge.= =20 ""It was so complicated that everybody was afraid to raise their hands and s= ay, 'I don't understand it,' "" Gagliardi said.=20 The questions are now coming, from a new committee reporting to Enron's boa= rd that will investigate how the company's financial reporting was handled;= from the SEC; and, eventually, from teams of lawyers representing aggrieve= d shareholders.=20 Lay indicated yesterday he had not been aware until recently that Enron emp= loyees other than Fastow had profited from the partnership activity. Enron = directors had approved Fastow's management of the partnerships, but Fastow = quit the partnerships in July and was then replaced as chief financial offi= cer.=20 Enron this week fired Treasurer Ben Glisan and Kristina Mourdant, an Enron = division lawyer, who it said had invested in partnerships that were tied to= one of the major partnerships headed by Fastow. The Enron report to the SE= C describes a central role in these transactions played by Michael J. Koppe= r, an associate of Fastow who left Enron in July to take over Fastow's fina= ncial interests in the partnership, the company said.=20 Enron will hold a conference call next week to discuss what it has uncovere= d about outside partnership investments.

All Rights Reserved. =09 Financial Desk The Nation NEWS ANALYSIS A Visionary Fallen From Grace JAMES FLANIGAN TIMES STAFF WRITER 11/10/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition A-22 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company A year ago, Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth L. Lay was on top of the energy wo= rld. As a leading fund-raiser, contributor and energy advisor to the Bush a= dministration, he played a key role in shaping the new president's energy p= olicy. As head of the world's largest energy trading company, he had an eno= rmous influence on the price of energy in California and across the nation.= Enron's highflying stock helped him cash out $123 million in stock options= last year alone.=20 On Friday, with Enron being saved from financial collapse by agreeing to be= acquired by rival Dynegy Inc., Lay's career and reputation are in shambles= . Under the merger, he will be stripped of a management job. His integrity = is tattered, with Enron's controversial financial dealings under federal in= vestigation. Enron investors and employees are chagrined and outraged becau= se the company's stock lost 80% of its value in recent weeks. The rapid rise and fall of Lay, 58, is a story of how a brilliant man with = innovative ideas and a grand scheme to transform the world's energy markets= was overcome with arrogance, associates and critics say. Under Lay, Enron = stretched the limits of the law and took risks that nearly caused its finan= cial collapse, they say. That in turn could have resulted in a widespread d= isruption in energy supplies.=20 ""Enron's behavior casts doubt on the integrity of our financial markets. It= is a very serious matter,"" said Edward R. Muller, an energy investor and f= ormer president of Edison International's Mission Energy subsidiary.=20 ""Nobody denies he's smart, but it's a question of integrity,"" said Raymond = Plank, chief executive of Apache Corp. and an associate of Lay's in Houston= 's vibrant oil and gas industry.=20 Lay and longtime partner Jeffrey K. Skilling, who served briefly as Enron's= chief executive before resigning abruptly in August, rose to prominence in= the last decade through the use of innovative financial techniques designe= d to exploit a reduction in government regulation of energy.=20 Lay transformed world energy industries through his vision of new, market-d= riven ways to finance natural gas and electricity production and transmissi= on.=20 The financial markets that Lay and his Enron associates created had an enor= mous effect on California's disastrous experiment in electricity deregulati= on. Critics say his influence was excessive and misguided.=20 ""Ken Lay was a mystic,"" said state Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon), an outspo= ken critic of Enron. ""Whatever he said had to make sense because he was Ken= Lay. It was hero worship. Many of the people working as economists at the = Federal Energy Regulatory Commission worshiped Ken Lay. As a consequence, t= he things Enron promoted and pushed for were never challenged, intellectual= ly and otherwise.""=20 Lay, who has a doctorate in economics, had modest beginnings as the son of = a poor country preacher who did farm labor on the side to raise money for h= is children's education. In the Navy in the late 1960s, Lay was assigned to= the Defense Department because of his economic acumen. ""He allocated Penta= gon dollars more efficiently in purchasing for the military,"" said Mark Pal= mer, chief spokesman for Enron.=20 Lay worked for Exxon and other energy firms in the 1970s, amid soaring oil = prices, gasoline shortages and still-regulated natural gas. He headed Houst= on Natural Gas, a predecessor firm of Enron, in the 1980s as falling prices= for oil and natural gas presented grave problems for Houston's energy indu= stries.=20 When the federal government allowed pipelines to carry the gas of any produ= cer, Lay turned Enron into a foremost firm in the new, deregulated industry= . Still, Enron almost went bankrupt in the late 1980s, with natural gas in = oversupply and prices falling.=20 It was then that Skilling, a McKinsey & Co. consultant, suggested to Lay th= at the firm trade long-term contracts for gas, promising to deliver the com= modity to customers at fixed prices, buying and selling contracts of varyin= g maturities ""the way mortgage companies deal with mortgages,"" in Skilling'= s words.=20 The innovation started Enron's rapid growth and rise to prominence as the e= mbodiment of a new kind of energy company. In the 1990s, the federal govern= ment called for deregulation of electricity.=20 Lay saw opportunities. He and Skilling created a market for contracts in el= ectricity in 1994, and by 1996 Enron was the world's leading firm doing suc= h business.=20 Lay's central idea was that, by creating a market of millions of buyers and= sellers constantly taking positions, power supplies could be allocated eff= iciently and prices lowered. Lay liked to lecture, in an avuncular way, abo= ut the new economics of energy trading.=20 ""Technology is changing, and there's a lot more value in flexibility and op= tionality. Just about in every industry, you can make them a lot more effic= ient when you have more optionality,"" Lay said in an interview in January i= n his Houston offices overlooking the sparkling new Enron headquarters buil= ding, which still is under construction.=20 As Enron's business profile grew, so did Lay's political influence. He serv= ed as an energy advisor to both Bush administrations and headed Texas fund-= raising for George W. Bush's presidential campaign. Lay raised $100,000 for= the Bush-Cheney campaign, and with his wife, Linda, Lay contributed anothe= r $100,000 to help finance the inaugural gala this year.=20 As the administration prepared its energy plan, Lay gained national stature= as a preacher of market economics applied to electricity.=20 ""There's no way you can centralize a command-control environment and make t= he best decisions to have an efficient, low-cost, reliable electricity indu= stry,"" Lay said.=20 His sermon was intended for California, which suffered sharply higher price= s for electricity last winter, to the point that private utilities fell int= o or near bankruptcy and the state budget incurred a cost of $12 billion, w= hich Sacramento now is trying to recover through the sale of revenue bonds.= =20 Because Enron, trading billions of dollars a day in power contracts worldwi= de, had an immense effect on electricity prices, Lay's preaching grated on = state officials. Driven to intemperance, state Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer said= in May that he'd like to ""escort"" Lay to a prison cell.=20 But more than economic philosophy was behind Lay's goading of California. T= he state's debacle gave energy deregulation a bad name and chilled deregula= tion moves by many other states.=20 That in turn reduced growth prospects for Enron. The promise of continued g= rowth in deregulation had helped make Enron a Wall Street darling. Its stoc= k price, at one point nearly $90 a share versus less than $10 now, pushed u= p the value of Enron stock options, held by almost all employees but owned = in great amounts by Lay, Skilling and other company officers.=20 Lay cashed in last year, converting options for a gain of $123 million, whi= le Skilling gained $62 million by converting his options. As they cashed in= , Enron was encountering other problems. Attempts to set up trading markets= in water and broadband Internet transmission were floundering. A major pow= er plant venture in India was in grave economic and political trouble.=20 But in the last month, Enron revealed that it had reduced the firm's equity= value by more than $1 billion due to write-offs in a hitherto hidden partn= ership.=20 Revelations then cascaded. The firm had 33 such partnerships, which had bil= lions of dollars in debt for which Enron was liable. Lay and Skilling piled= up debt in hidden partnerships, analysts explain, because the firm needed = huge amounts of debt to support its greatly expanding levels of trading in = electricity, natural gas and other commodities.=20 But the firm could not support such debt and still retain its credit rating= , growth rate and high stock price. After weeks of gamely protesting that t= he business was sound and that he personally took offense at investment ana= lysts' suggestions of impropriety, Lay fell silent.=20 *=20 Times staff writer Nancy Vogel in Sacramento contributed to this report.

London, Nov. 10 (Bloomberg) -- Dynegy Inc.'s $23 billion acquisition of Enron Corp. is at too early a stage for either company to know how many U.K. jobs will be eliminated, an Enron spokesman said, after a newspaper reported 4,000 are at risk. Dynegy's acquisition of the biggest energy trader, announced yesterday, ``is still a long way off from closing,'' said Enron spokesman Alex Parsons. ``It's too early to know what the impact will be on U.K. jobs,'' he said. The Daily Mail newspaper, which didn't cite sources, said today that 4,000 jobs are at risk, mainly at Enron's Wessex water unit, in southwest England, two power plants on Teeside, in northeast England, and at its energy trading operation. It employs 5,400 people in Europe, mostly in the U.K., said Parsons. Dynegy said yesterday it would save as much as $500 million a year by ``winding down'' Enron's business outside of trading and pipelines and cutting costs. Enron decided to sell after its shares plunged 90 percent this year amid investors' concerns about the accuracy of its financial statements. The company had said in October it planned to eliminate as many as 500 jobs in Europe, or almost as much as 10 percent of the workforce there, to reduce costs. Offset Risk The company, which owns generation in the U.K. to offset risk in its power trading operations, said in August two workers died and two others were seriously injured in an explosion and fire at Teeside power station, which it operates and partly owns. Enron owns Wessex Water as part of its Azurix water unit. It spent $2.8 billion in 1998 for Wessex, from which Azurix emerged. Enron sold Azurix shares to the public in 1999, and then bought back the company this year after the unit failed in its strategy of buying up water companies and winning large projects. In August, Enron agreed to sell Azurix's North American business to American Water Works Inc. for $150 million. The Dynegy transaction is expected to close in 2002's third quarter. The new company will have $90 billion in assets, Dynegy said. Dynegy's stockholders, including ChevronTexaco, will have 64 percent of the new company. Enron's holders will own the rest. The merger will face opposition from consumer groups, especially in California, where energy traders such as Dynegy and Enron were blamed for soaring electricity prices that left the state's biggest utility bankrupt and the second-largest fighting for a government bailout. Other companies may yet be caught in the fallout from Enron's situation. Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc is a lender to Enron, the Guardian newspaper reported today, without citing sources. It's unclear how much the U.K.'s No. 3 bank by assets lent Enron, though it may be as high as several million pounds, the paper said. It's not clear if the loans are secured, it said. Royal Bank was involved in setting up a credit facility for Enron, the newspaper said, adding this helped push down the company's share price by 2.6 percent yesterday. --Mathieu Robbins in the London newsroom (+44 20) 7673 2097 Dynegy to Buy Enron for $23 Billion in Stock, Debt (Update9) 2001-11-09 23:23 (New York) Dynegy to Buy Enron for $23 Billion in Stock, Debt (Update9) (Adds advisers in last paragraph.) Houston, Nov. 9 (Bloomberg) -- Dynegy Inc. agreed to buy Enron Corp. for at least $23 billion in stock and assumed debt, ending a financial crisis that threatened to bankrupt Enron and disrupt U.S. power and natural-gas markets. Investors will get 0.2685 of a Dynegy share for each Enron share, or $10.41 based on Dynegy's closing price today. The stock portion of the transaction is valued at $8 billion to $9 billion, Dynegy Chief Financial Officer Robert Doty said. Dynegy said it will assume about $15 billion in Enron debt. Enron, the largest energy trader, decided to sell after its shares plunged 90 percent this year and a federal investigation of accounting irregularities limited its ability to finance operations. Enron's collapse would have caused upheaval in energy markets, where the company does one-quarter of all gas and power trades, traders say. ``Without someone stepping in to play the role Enron plays, people (would) have a difficult time executing transactions,'' said Daniel Gordon, president of Allegheny Energy Inc.'s trading unit. ChevronTexaco Corp., the second-biggest U.S. oil company and owner of 26 percent of Dynegy, will provide Enron with $1.5 billion immediately. ChevronTexaco will give Dynegy $1 billion after the merger closes. Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Charles Watson, who led a company that has put as much emphasis on building power plants as on energy trading, will take over a larger rival that Chairman and CEO Kenneth Lay had focused on trading. Earnings Reduced Lay's strategy boosted Enron's reported revenue to $100.7 billion in 2000, almost four times Dynegy's and more than 20 times what Enron generated in 1995. At its peak in December 2000, Enron stock was valued at more than $69 billion. In recent months, Enron shares plummeted as investors began to question the accuracy of Enron's financial statements, saying it was unclear whether the company was using affiliated partnerships to move debt off its books and hide losses. Yesterday the company restated its earnings for the past four years, lowering them by more than $500 million to include losses from partnerships it once kept off its books. After the merger announcement, Standard & Poor's Investors Service said it may lower Dynegy's debt rating. It cut Enron's to ``BBB-,'' one notch above junk. Watson, Dynegy President Stephen Bergstrom and CFO Doty will keep their positions at the combined company. Greg Whalley, the president and chief operating officer of Enron, will be an executive vice president. Lay said he won't be an active manager in the new company. Lay has not discussed a severance package with him, Watson said. $200 Billion in Revenue Dynegy said it will have annual revenue of more than $200 billion, more than 22,000 megawatts of electric generating capacity and 25,000 miles of pipeline after the merger. The company will save as much as $500 million a year by ``winding down'' Enron's business outside of trading and pipelines and cutting costs, Dynegy said. The announcement of the merger came after the close of stock market trading, though the two companies had acknowledged they were in talks. Shares of Dynegy rose $2.26, or 6 percent, to $38.76. Enron rose 22 cents to $8.63. ChevronTexaco rose $1.90 to $89.49. Enron's 6.4 percent bonds, which mature in 2006, jumped to about 76 cents on the dollar, up from 69 cents, traders said. The combination is expected to be ``strongly accretive'' to earnings, Dynegy said. It projected earnings of $3.40 to $3.50 a share next year. It had been expected to earn $2.57, the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call. Third Quarter Closing The transaction is expected to close in 2002's third quarter. The new company will have $90 billion in assets, Dynegy said. Dynegy's stockholders, including ChevronTexaco, will have 64 percent of the new company. Enron's holders will own the rest. ``Dynegy is taking out a competitor, acquiring some attractive assets and they're doing it at an incredible price,'' said Joseph Correnti, an analyst at Wayne Hummer Investments who doesn't own shares of either company. Enron will pay a $350 million breakup fee if the transaction collapses. The two Houston-based companies began negotiations a week ago as it became apparent that Enron needed cash to stay in business. Watson said he approached Lay. ``I simply called Ken to see if there was anything we could do to straighten'' out rumors of a cash crunch at Enron, Watson said. ``That next Saturday, Ken was gracious enough to invite me over to his home.'' Dynegy agreed to the terms after Moody's Investors Service maintained an investment grade rating on Enron today, eliminating a stumbling block in negotiations. Cash Crunch Moody's announcement removed the threat that a junk rating would force Enron to repay early $3.3 billion in bonds. Enron has been battling a cash crunch and a loss of investor confidence because of questions about partnerships started by its senior executives. Enron fired Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow in October as a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation focused in on partnerships he headed and helped create. Enron estimated Fastow made $30 million through partnerships affiliated with the company. The SEC began the investigation after Enron reduced third- quarter earnings by more than $1 billion and said dealings with two partnerships had lowered shareholder equity by $1.2 billion. ``Clearly, (the partnerships) created quite a perception problem for the company, and maybe more serious problems than that,'' Lay said on a conference call after the buyout announcement. ``We'll see over time.'' California Opposition The merger will face opposition from consumer groups, especially in California, where energy traders such as Dynegy and Enron were blamed for soaring electricity prices that left the state's biggest utility bankrupt and the second-largest fighting for a government bailout. ``We will petition the state attorney general and federal authorities to block this merger,'' said Doug Heller of the California-based Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. ``This would further tighten the grip that the unregulated power industry has over California, and it's the grip of the energy cartel that has choked California for the last year and a half.'' Energy trading markets ``are relatively fragmented'' so there should be no antitrust problems, even though Enron and Dynegy are big companies, said Robert Burka, a Washington-based antitrust attorney with Foley & Lardner. ``Enron may well not be a healthy company going forward'' if the merger isn't approved, Burka said. EnronOnline The combination of the two companies will leave Watson with control of EnronOnline, an Internet energy and commodities trading site that has done more than $880 billion in trades since it was created in November 1999. ``It's not perfectly capturing the value of Enron, but if you're on the board at Enron at this point, you take it and move on,'' said Correnti of Wayne Hummer Investments. The total value of the stock portion of the transaction could rise, depending how many Enron shares need to be converted in the stock swap. An Enron spokesman said the company had 913 million shares on a fully diluted basis, though a person familiar with the talks said Enron's stock price is so low that many common share equivalents won't be converted, leaving the number at 743 million shares.

In addition, the long-term credit ratings of Dynegy Inc. (DYN) and Dy= negy Holdings Inc. (DYNH) are placed on Rating Watch Negative. A Rating Wat= ch Negative means that the ratings may be lowered or affirmed. The outstand= ing `F2' rated commercial paper programs for DYN and DYNH are not affected. The rating actions follow Dynegy's announcement that it has reached a defin= itive agreement to acquire Enron Corp. in a stock-for-stock transaction und= er which Enron shareholders will receive a fixed amount of DYN shares. Fitc= h does not anticipate the rating of the combined company dropping below the= mid-`BBB' range based on its preliminary assessment.=20 The transaction carries significant financial support from ChevronTexaco Co= rp. (CVX), a 27% stakeholder in DYN, which has committed to provide up to $= 2.5 billion of new equity to DYN. The CVX equity commitment includes a $1.5= billion cash injection to occur over the next several days, which in turn = will immediately be contributed by DYN to Enron to provide interim liquidit= y support. This upfront capital contribution will be structured as a prefer= red stock investment with an option to buy 100% of the common stock in Nort= hern Natural Gas Co. (NNG). The remaining $1.0 billion of equity will be fu= nded at closing. In addition, CVX has options to contribute up to $1 billio= n of additional equity at specified amounts and retains its rights to maint= ain its current economic interest in the merged entity. The transaction is = expected to close within six to nine months and will require several regula= tory approvals, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Fed= eral Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and Hart-Scott Rodino.=20 Fitch is revising its Rating Watch on Enron's outstanding debt securities t= o Evolving based on conditions of the transaction which address several maj= or concerns, the most time sensitive being liquidity. The $1.5 billion equi= ty infusion improves Enron's liquidity position, which now appears adequate= to fund Enron's cash needs through the first quarter of 2002 under expecte= d business conditions. However, Enron faces significant refinancing risk. E= nron's fully drawn $1.75 billion 364-day committed bank credit facility is = up for renewal in April 2002 and the $2.4 billion of outstanding Osprey Tru= st notes are expected to be repaid by mid-2002. Relating to Osprey, Fitch e= stimates that trust asset sale proceeds will not be adequate to fully fund = maturing Osprey debt. Therefore, Enron will potentially need to provide mor= e than $500 million to pay off the notes. Fitch will closely monitor Enron'= s cash position through the merger period.=20 Fitch anticipates that the surviving company's rating would move to the mid= -`BBB' range assuming the successful execution of its interim plans to dele= verage its capital structure and the completion of the merger. If the merge= r were to terminate, Fitch believes Enron's ability to manage its business = would be severely impaired and would expect to downgrade its securities to = highly speculative grade. Termination provisions to the merger agreement ad= d an element of uncertainty to completing the merger. If the transaction we= re terminated, DYN would have the option to own NNG, removing both a valuab= le property and stable cash flow source from Enron's credit profile.=20 The Rating Watch Negative status for DYN and DYNH reflects some uncertainty= over the ultimate outcome of its post-merger credit profile. While the pro= posed transaction structure will not require incremental debt financing, DY= N will likely assume many of the difficulties which continue to plague Enro= n including the need to sell underperforming emerging market assets, the on= going SEC investigations of certain Enron sponsored partnerships, and poten= tial litigation arising from several shareholder suits filed against Enron.= While Enron management is actively working to reduce debt and exit problem= businesses, it is possible that not all outstanding issues will be resolve= d within the transaction approval timeframe.=20 A positive consideration for DYN is the structure of the merger agreement w= hich contains a series of out provisions enabling it to terminate the merge= r upon occurrence of specific material adverse changes including Enron liti= gation exposure in excess of specified levels or a drop in Enron's senior u= nsecured credit rating below investment grade. In addition, Dynegy's upfron= t capital contribution is protected by the underlying value of NNG. Based o= n these provisions, Fitch would not expect to change Dynegy's current long-= term ratings in the event the transaction became unwound.=20 Other positives resulting from the merger include: improved management cred= ibility through Dynegy's assumption of senior executive positions and board= of directors control; the reduction of leverage at the new company from Ch= evronTexaco's equity commitment; the aggressive downsizing and exiting of n= on-core operations; potential cost savings through the merger, conservative= ly estimated at $500 million annually; and the market strength of the merge= d company, particularly as it relates to Enron's and Dynegy Holdings' North= American wholesale marketing and trading franchises.=20 The following ratings are impacted by today's rating action: Enron -- `BBB-' senior unsecured debt; -- `BB' subordinated debt; -- `B+' preferred stock; -- `F3' commercial paper. Northern Natural Gas Co. Transwestern Pipeline Co. -- `BBB-' senior unsecured debt. Dynegy Inc. -- `BBB' implied senior unsecured debt rating. Dynegy Holdings Inc. -- outstanding `BBB+' senior notes. Dynegy Capital Trust I -- outstanding `BBB' trust preferred securities.

Subject:: New MSC Committee Report
Body:: All: I just downloaded the attached from the ISO's website. It is dated 12/1/00= . =20 To boil it down, the MSC comes down against ""soft"" caps and recommends the= =20 ""get market-based rates in return for selling forward"" proposal that the IS= O=20 staff is pushing. Forward contracts would need to at rates that=20 ""approximate"" competitive prices. Based on my quick read that does not mea= n=20 market prices; it means somthing more akin to cost of service. MSC also=20 wants there to be a penalty on generators for underscheduling. They also= =20 claim there proposal will not exacerbate reliability problems. I would be interested in people's opinion if Enron should be responding to= =20 this report. Given the date of the report, I am not sure if/how the ISO=20 would file this at the FERC. G. Alan Comnes (GAC) Here's the list of recommendations from the report. (1) The PX =01&must-buy=018 requirement would become a =01&must-schedule=01= 8 requirement.=20 IOUs would be required to schedule all forward energy through the PX, but would = be=20 free to purchase it from any source. (2) California generators and entities that sell to any California purchase= r=20 (not limited to the PX and ISO) could continue to be eligible for market-based rates (and would= =20 be free of refund obligations) only if they offer a substantial portion of their sales= =20 in the form of two-year contracts at rates that approximate competitive prices. The detail= s=20 of such a proposal are outlined in this report. The volume offered by sellers, in the= =20 aggregate, would be sufficient to cover the all three IOUs=01, residential and small= =20 commercial customer load using an average load profile for weekdays and weekends for= =20 each month. (3) Any market participant that does not offer these two-year=20 market-power-mitigation forward contracts would be subject to cost-of-service rates for all of thei= r=20 sales of energy and ancillary services into the California market for at least the two-year= =20 market power mitigation period. (4) The CPUC would be encouraged to set a default rate for IOU residential= =20 and small commercial customers based on projected wholesale energy costs under the=20 2-year contracts described above. (5) The under-scheduling penalty should be even-handed. The MSC recommends = a=20 real-time trading charge that is applicable both to load and generation and, more=20 important, does not distinguish between instructed and uninstructed deviations from schedul= e.

I requested that Morris provide some persepective on GSS. Please review and forward to Stan, if appropriate. -----Original Message----- From: Brassfield, Morris Sent: Wednesday, November 21, 2001 10:05 AM To: Saunders, James Subject: Confidential - GSS Organization Value to ETS Here are my thoughts on the value the GSS (Global Strategic Sourcing) brings to ETS: I believe totally in the concept of strategically sourcing our materials and services for ETS, which is the concept that GSS was founded under, while still within the ETS organization. Basically the value that GSS has brought to the bottom line during the last year has been minimal to ETS. The reasons for that statement, in my opinion, are: * The materials and services that ETS purchase are basic and routine. * Most of those materials and service providers were identified and sourced during 1999 and 2000. * ETS is reaching the point where we need fewer providers, not more. * New items identified are normally rolled into one of our already sourced NPA's. * Almost all large dollar items are bid out (three bids and a buy). * GSS's involvement and commitment to the deal ends with the contract signing. * ETS P&SM organization and our Contracts services group deals with the actual execution and the ringing of the cash register. If the GSS organization went away tomorrow, we would need the following expertise brought over from their group: (currently this group is close to 75 people.)(and very highly paid individuals) * Two (2) negotiators - Contract Managers * Two (2) analysts * Two (2) contract administrators The administration of the following services would need to be shifted to the ISC: * iBuyit System * Catalog system (part of iBuyit) * iPayit system We would need to re-assess the value of the contract with SourceNet and whether we continue down that path or implement our own A/P department. This would take very few staff adds to make that happen. Let me know if you need any further detail. Morris (713) 503-1409

Subject:: Re: CONFIDENTIAL - Residential in CA
Body:: Agreed. Trying to be too cute with our strategy is difficult. Look, about 4 years ago we pulled out of the market. I think that we need to simply accept that these customers are going back sooner or later. NPC won't even pick this up. Jim Paul Kaufman@ECT 04/13/2001 01:06 PM To: Karen Denne/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Jeff Dasovich Subject: Re: CONFIDENTIAL - Residential in CA I like the idea, particularly if we can time any decision to turn the customers back so it falls after the failure to get some action out of Sacto (instead of after our earnings release). The only problem I see is that we would need a decision from the top that we're not going to turn the customers back if we get direct access (so we can end the debate). I don't think it helps us if we get lucky, get direct access back, then make a decision to return customers to the utility.

I strongly believe that the public hit we will take will be far greater than our actual out-of-pocket losses. We will be crucified by the public, media, consumer groups, legislators, governor, attorney general, etc., and this action will reaffirm our reputation of packing up and leaving when it's not in our interest. The impact of this action would be exacerbated since it is on the heels of UC/CSU. I would also argue that this hurts our national dereg efforts. If we're advocating that competition and choice benefits consumers and then we turn around and pull out of a market and abandon customers when we're not ""profiting,"" we'll kill any chances we have of ever serving retail customers in California -- or in any other state. We look foolish advocating for direct access when we're not willing to serve our existing -- let alone future customers What about a preemptive strike that engages these 16,000 customers to weigh in on direct access -- i.e. a letter that says ""Enron may be forced to cancel its contract -- call/write/send the enclosed postcard to your legislator and tell them you want to keep your right to choose your energy service provider."" Our credibility is on the line. Before we take this action, we need to be cognizant of all the long-range strategic implications, and we need to seriously weigh the negative impact this will have on our corporate reputation, on our legislative abilities and on our commercial success going forward. kd James D Steffes 04/12/2001 09:05 PM To: Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron, Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT, Sandra McCubbin/NA/Enron@Enron, Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, Janel Guerrero/Corp/Enron@Enron, Mark Palmer/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Karen Denne/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Susan J Mara/NA/Enron, Peggy Mahoney/HOU/EES@EES, Harry Kingerski/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Dan Leff/HOU/EES@EES Subject: CONFIDENTIAL - Residential in CA In the meeting today, no decision was made about what to do with Enron's 16,000 residential customers. Each of the contracts gives a basic 30 day out right to Enron. That being said, I think that we have a short window to push for DA before any public action impacts us in Sacramento. I realize that the ultimate action (which I think is inevitable) makes it harder for our advocacy on DA, but real $ are flowing out of the company. EES will give us notice when a decision is reached.

Davis's Plan To Power California --- State's Outlays for Electricity May Be Hard to Recover Without Rate Increases --- Betting on Long-Term Deals ------------------------ Breakthrough made in rescue of PG&E State ready to pay $7 billion for lines By Steve Geissinger SACRAMENTO BUREAU SACRAMENTO -- Signaling a breakthrough in secret energy crisis talks, the Davis administration disclosed Tuesday it may announce the framework of a pact to rescue the teetering Pacific Gas and Electric Co. next week. ""Things are going very well,"" said Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis. The state appears to be poised to pay at least $7 billion -- and possibly billions more -- for PG&E's high-voltage transmission lines as part of a deal to financially renovate the north-state utility, according to sources familiar with the negotiations. But consumer advocates insisted that even the $7 billion price is too much to pay. And experts warned that a deal with PG&E will be more complex than with other utilities. PG&E representatives declined comment, in keeping with their policy on the talks, even though the Davis administration said an announcement could come as early as next week or the following week. The new timetable for an announcement was substantially sooner than in Davis' original forecast. Until late last week, PG&E was still resisting the sale of its power grid despite the fact that Davis had announced the framework of an agreement with Southern California Edison. Davis expects to soon announce a similar deal with the San Diego Gas and Electric Co. However, any such deal still would need federal approval. The investor-owned utilities, trapped between high wholesale costs and lower, regulated retail rates, amassed nearly $13 billion in debts and were unable to buy electricity this winter. With the onset of rolling blackouts, the state began brokering billions of dollars in emergency short- and long-term power purchases. Davis' strategy to ease the energy price and supply crisis includes bolstering both conservation and generation while fiscally refurbishing the nearly bankrupt utilities. As part of the rescue deal, the utilities would have to drop legal actions seeking dramatically higher electricity bills, environmentally shield wildlands they own, sell power from their generators to Californians for the next decade and secure help with their debts from their parent companies. Together with the cash infusion from the sale of their power 26,000-mile power grids, the utilities would be allowed to sell bonds to raise funds and use customer money to pay them off. The state would upgrade the high-voltage lines and lease them back to the utilities for operation. In a reflection of the negotiations with the three utilities, a Davis administration official said the deal with PG&E is proving to be more complex than with the other firms. Though PG&E finally agreed late last week to sell its transmission grid, the utility apparently wants more than the $7 billion that Davis has offered, according to sources. The figure is more than twice the book amount, or the value placed on the system for purposes of accounting. And that's the markup that lured Edison into an agreement to sell its smaller portion of the transmission grid for $2.8 billion. But PG&E, which fears an erosion of its economic base, may be asking as much as $10 billion. Due to complexities in the state's 1996 deregulation of the industry, PG&E is more likely to lose revenue than Edison as a result of selling its transmission lines, according to experts. Big customers might be able to bypass the utility's remaining local distribution lines, thereby eroding its customer base. Therefore the utility may view bankruptcy, and sale of its transmission lines to the highest bidder, as a potentially attractive alternative to selling its share of the grid to the state at too low a price. ---- El Paso Energy closes six valley power plants Filed: 03/07/2001 By CHIP POWER, Californian staff writer e-mail: ppower@bakersfield.com El Paso Energy, citing non-payment from Pacific Gas & Electric Co., said it has shut down six cogeneration plants this week. The smaller plants produced about 175 megawatts of electricity and are located primarily in the San Joaquin Valley, said company spokesman Mel Scott. A megawatt can supply power to 1,000 homes. At least 10 plants have closed in the past two weeks as a result of non-payment, according to the state Independent System Operator, which manages most of the state's electrical distribution. The El Paso Energy plants are operated with various partners and had not been compensated for December, January and February deliveries, said Scott. He said he did not know the total amount due but said the plants would be closed until PG&E's credit worthiness is improved. A cogeneration plant, common in oil fields, simultaneously produces heat energy and electrical or mechanical power from the same fuel in the same facility. Typically, it produces electricity and steam, which can be deployed to enhance oil recovery. Kern County is the state's leading oil-producing county. El Paso owns or has interests in more than 40,000 miles of interstate and intrastate pipeline connecting the nation's principal natural gas supply regions to the five largest consuming regions in the United States, namely the Gulf Coast, California, the Northeast, the Midwest and the Southeast. El Paso closed up 99 cents on Tuesday, or 1.4 percent, at $71.49. The Houston-based company's stock price has ranged between $36.31 and $75.30 in the last 52 weeks. ---- Still undecided: Who'll pay DWR for electricity By Karen Gaudette ASSOCIATED PRESS SAN FRANCISCO -- The price tag is $3.2 billion and counting for electricity bought by the state Department of Water Resources for the customers of two nearly bankrupt utilities. Pacific Gas and Electric Co., Southern California Edison and the state disagree over how the DWR eventually will be reimbursed for its purchases on the expensive last-minute power market. So do the state power regulators, who have the final call over who gets the money when. Under a recent law, the DWR went into the electricity-buying business to help keep the two utilities from sinking further into their $13 billion debt. The state plans to retrieve the money by selling $10 billion in revenue bonds. The utilities continue to collect ratepayer dollars on that electricity, which the bill's author, Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, says is meant to help them begin paying down their debt. In a recent letter, however, DWR officials requested that the state Public Utilities Commission order that a portion of that money be diverted to the state. But after the utilities subtract the costs of generating electricity, payments to environmentally friendly power plants and other expenses, there is no money left from ratepayer dollars to give to the DWR without sinking further into debt, PG&E spokesman Ron Low said Tuesday. If it passed along money to the DWR, ""our undercollection would grow by about $2.4 billion by the end of the year,"" Low said. The commission, unable to agree on the best course of action, left the issue untouched at its last meeting but expects to revisit the issue when it meets this morning. Commissioner Richard Bilas is proposing an alternate plan that would have the DWR set its own revenue requirements that would be passed on to ratepayers. The PUC also is expected to respond to complaints from laid-off workers and customers that layoffs by utilities to cut costs have been hurting service. Commissioner Carl Wood warned at the last meeting that failure to provide safe and reliable service could mean fines for the utilities. Representatives from electrical workers unions, the PUC and the utilities were to discuss the issue Tuesday afternoon. ""I don't think we believe that utilities can find a way out of their problems by laying off workers,"" said Mindy Spatt, a spokeswoman with the Utility Reform Network. ""We think consumers deserve safe and reliable service, and we think they deserve it at a reasonable price."" ---- State Taxpayers In Dark on Details Of Energy Deal David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer Wednesday, March 7, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle Few people would purchase a car simply because the dealer said, ''Trust me, it's a great deal.'' Yet Gov. Gray Davis essentially is telling Californians just that about dozens of long-term power contracts. Because of confidentiality agreements with power companies, the governor has revealed only scant details about the state's multibillion-dollar contracts for electricity over the next 10 years. ""Gov. Davis has our money, and we can't see how he's spending it,"" said Doug Heller, a spokesman for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. ""We've been locked out of the room."" Neither Davis nor power companies would divulge specific details about the price, duration or scope of individual contracts. Each cited secrecy clauses that the governor's office said had been desired by both sides. What consumers do know is this: -- California has signed 40 contracts and tentative accords, valued at about $40 billion, to secure enough power to light 9 million homes over the next decade. -- The average purchase price of each deal is $69 per megawatt hour -- well above the $30 to $40 charged by power generators before California's energy market went haywire last summer. -- If, as is widely expected, wholesale power prices fall in years ahead, the state nevertheless will be locked into paying above-market rates for electricity. But it is not known which generator agreed to part with the most power at the cheapest level or the full range of the prices in concocting the $69 average. Moreover, it is unclear how shrewdly the state negotiated with taxpayer money in securing power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities. ""These agreements are the bedrock of our long-term energy policy,"" Davis said Monday in announcing the deals. The governor's office defended the murky nature of the contracts yesterday. ""It's a business transaction in which private corporate information is included,"" said Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Davis. ""That's the kind of information that never gets revealed."" While additional elements of the contracts will be publicized in coming months, he said, the contracts themselves will remain a secret. ""You'll never see all the details,"" Maviglio said. This did not sit well with many observers. ""It's a breach of public trust,"" said Daniel Bacon, a San Francisco attorney specializing in business law. ""A public servant spending public money shouldn't be able to keep the spending secret."" But Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an energy-industry association in Menlo Park, called confidentiality agreements ""a necessary evil in transactions like this."" He explained that no power company would agree to a long-term contract if rival firms could learn the terms of the accord. The company would be losing too much of its competitive edge in the marketplace, Ackerman said. At the same time, he noted that secrecy allowed the buyer -- in this case, California taxpayers -- to secure more favorable terms with individual sellers. A high price with one generator would not necessarily be sought by all power providers. Still, the fact that public funds are being used makes confidentiality in this case a different matter than, say, Cisco Systems' quietly negotiating to take over yet another tech rival. ""The public is in a very awkward position,"" said Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. ""It has to rely on the good word and expertise of the governor, and he has yet to demonstrate that he has expertise or good word in this field."" Shames likened consumers to passengers in a plane being flown by a pilot without a license to fly. ""But what choice do we have?"" he asked. ""I don't see many other options available right now."" There's the rub. No matter how bad a deal California may have cut to help meet its energy demands, the alternative -- blackouts, disruptions, economic catastrophe -- is far, far worse. On the other hand, it already appears that the new contracts will not shield Californians from the threat of daily outages this summer, when demand surges. Davis said only about 60 percent of the state's summertime electricity needs so far had been met. Part of the reason is that many power companies already have contracted for their output this year. Duke Energy said this was why it would not begin its nine-year contract with California until 2002, while Williams Cos. said it would only gradually increase the amount of available wattage in its 10-year contract. Both companies, meanwhile, will continue to profit this summer by selling into the volatile ""spot"" market, where wholesale power went for as much as $1, 500 per megawatt hour last year. ""You can't sell all your power into long-term contracts,"" said Paula Hall- Collins, a Williams spokeswoman. ""You save some for the spot market."" Consumer groups worry that consumers will be hammered again this summer with sky-high power prices, and then get nailed down the road by contracts for above-market rates. ""If we could look at the terms of the deals, we'd see that California is being gouged for 10 years,"" said Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. ""But the governor doesn't want us to see that."" Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum said the state had gotten the best rates it could under current market conditions. ""California went for long-term contracts when everyone else moved in as well,"" he said. ""Californians are paying a price for not acting sooner."" ---- Lawmakers pitch fixes for region's energy woes By David Whitney Bee Washington Bureau (Published March 7, 2001) WASHINGTON -- California members of Congress pleaded for everything from wholesale price caps to extending daylight-saving time an extra hour to help the region cope this summer with its persistent electricity shortage, but none of the ideas seemed to catch fire at a House hearing Tuesday. ""People will die in California because of this crisis,"" Rep. Brad Sherman, a Los Angeles-area Republican, warned the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Sherman testified that his idea for saving lives is to extend daylight-saving time by an extra hour, so that there would be more daylight at the end of the day when power consumption surges. ""One of the peak demand periods for electricity occurs between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m., when the sun sets and people come home from work,"" Sherman testified. ""If people come home and it is light out, there is less of an inclination to turn a light on."" Sherman said the state Legislature has called for congressional approval for states to be given authority to extend daylight-saving time, and he cited analyses by the California Energy Commission and other agencies suggesting that it could cut power consumption by 1 percent to 2 percent. Sherman, who was one of about a dozen California lawmakers presenting their views on the energy squeeze, drew no questions from committee leaders about what his legislation might do to everything from airline schedules to television programming if West Coast states didn't agree on the same time standard. Most of the committee's questioning was on the more popular idea proposed by several California and Western lawmakers, primarily Democrats, to require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose caps on wholesale electricity prices that have gone wild because of a regional power shortage. Rep. Bob Filner, D-San Diego, charged that the price spiral has little to do with power shortages but a lot to do with a ""small cartel"" of generators bilking ratepayers. Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., said he brought up the idea of regional price caps with President Bush, who was initially skeptical. But Inslee said that Bush warmed to the idea after being told that protections could be built into the caps so as not to discourage construction of new power plants. Upon hearing that, Inslee said, Bush invited him to meet with the president's Cabinet-level task force led by Vice President Dick Cheney on a national energy strategy. But Inslee said he can't get the group to meet with him. ""It's very disappointing,"" Inslee said. Tuesday's hearing was part of a series the panel is holding on the California crisis, so far without any emerging consensus on what, if anything, Congress should do. ---- Power plan called wrong Wall Street analysts say the governor's approach to the problem avoids the issue that caused the imbalance. March 7, 2001 By DON THOMPSON The Associated Press SACRAMENTO California's scramble to insulate consumers from the soaring price of electricity may add to the state's power problems this summer, Wall Street analysts said Tuesday. Gov. Gray Davis' emphasis on buying utilities' transmission lines and negotiating long-term power contracts to help ease their debts skirts the deep imbalance between wholesale and market rates that led to the state's power problems in the first place, they said. ""In the long run, it doesn't solve anything,"" said Michael Worms, an industry analyst for Gerard Klauer Mattison & Co. ""In the long run, you need to send the right price signals to consumers, which will create its own conservation signals. Unfortunately, customers were shielded from that in California."" Davis said Monday that the state's first contracts to buy electricity for two financially struggling utilities will provide only about two-thirds of the power needed on a typical summer day, forcing Californians to cut power use at least 10 percent to avoid blackouts. Since early January, the state has been buying one- third of the power Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. customers need. The two utilities, denied credit by suppliers, say they have lost nearly $14 billion due to soaring wholesale electricity prices that the state's industry-deregulation law says they cannot pass on to consumers. The keepers of the state power grid had enough electricity Tuesday to avoid declaring an electricity alert, but have faced an almost-daily scramble for weeks due to a tight supply and high wholesale prices. Several wholesale and retail rate proposals are circulating. Among them: Free-market advocates such as Worms want an immediate end to the deregulation-imposed retail rate freeze on Edison and PG&E that will expire next year. Davis wants a Western price cap of $100 per megawatt hour on power generators he says have been prof iteering from California's short energy supply. The Bush administration and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission are cool to that idea. In December, FERC imposed a ""soft cap"" of $150 per megawatt hour on wholesale rates in the state and required suppliers to justify any higher prices they charge. Consumer groups such as The Utility Reform Network, or TURN, want regulated rates for residential and small-business customers, but free-market rates for large industrial customers, which sought deregulation in the first place. TURN also advocates a tiered rate structure, with higher rates for consumers who use more than a reasonable amount of electricity each month. Assembly Republicans say electricity and natural-gas prices will fall naturally if the state increases supply, mainly by making it easier to build plants and pipelines. ""Right now, you're sort of sitting partially with regulation and part with the free market,"" said Paul Fremont, an analyst with Jefferies & Co. ""Both these systems work. It's sort of that in-between system that you have in Califor nia that doesn't appear to be working."" The system discourages generators from building new power plants because they aren't guaranteed a profit, and it doesn't do enough to discourage power use by consumers because the price they pay doesn't reflect the true cost of power, Fremont said. ""I don't think people here have much faith in the market, and why should they?"" countered TURN's Mindy Spatt. ""I think there are probably better ways of encouraging consumers to conserve than by gouging them."" Davis insists the crisis can be resolved without raising rates for Edison and PG&E customers beyond ""the existing rate structure."" In January, state regulators imposed temporary rate hikes of 7 to 15 percent on Edison and PG&E customers. The Legislature and Davis extended the increases for up to a decade to help pay back the estimated $10 billion in power buying the state expects to do for Edison and PG&E over the next several years, and finance its purchase of the power lines owned by the two companies and San Diego Gas & Electric. Rates were already scheduled to increase next year for Edison and PG&E customers. Under the 1996 deregulation law, the pair's ratepayers saw a 10 percent rate reduction, but only until early 2002. That rate cut will likely expire as planned, Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio has said. Davis wants those rates to cover not only the traditional cost of generating, transporting and distributing power, but the added cost of paying off the two utilities' massive debt and buying their transmission lines, said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, the Assembly's chief power negotiator. Yet Davis has indirectly addressed the rate imbalance by signing legislation that will let regulators raise consumer rates if necessary, Keeley said. The governor and lawmakers are in effect spreading out rate increases over a decade by using long-term revenue bonds to buy power for the nearly bankrupt utilities, said Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy Institute. ""At some point we have to deal with the reality that all of the power that we buy has to be paid for by somebody - it's either going to come from taxpayers or it's going to come from ratepayers,"" Bor enstein said. ""Raising rates now would get us a lot of conservation."" Davis also wants financial incentives for conservation and power-plant construction in time to make a difference this summer. ""Our mouths were agape"" at the rapid timetable, Keeley said. Legislators are rushing to pass those incentives by month's end, he said, allowing three months for consumers and suppliers to act before the heat of summer. Among bills considered Tuesday, the Senate Energy Committee approved legislation to accelerate the siting of power plants. It also was considering a proposal to restructure rates for generators that use renewable energy to provide about 30 percent of the state's electricity. ---- Bill to Cut Some Power Prices Stalls Energy: Democrats balk at varying payment levels for alternative generators. By DAN MORAIN, JULIE TAMAKI, Times Staff Writers SACRAMENTO--Legislation aimed at cutting prices for more than a fourth of the power consumed in California stalled Tuesday, as Democrats questioned why a few alternative energy generators--some of them campaign donors--stood to receive higher payments than others. Lawmakers working to unravel California's energy mess have been negotiating for weeks in an effort to cut the price paid to more than 600 generators of alternative power by more than half, to below 8 cents a kilowatt-hour. Those alternative generators' contracts with utilities have shot up in recent months because of a rise in the price of natural gas. The cash-strapped corporations have suspended or made partial payments to the generators over the last few months, causing many to shut down or reduce their outputs. But even as the lawmakers reached agreement that pushed the average price to near the 8-cent level per kilowatt-hour, some generators would have received higher prices under the bill by state Sen. Jim Battin (R-La Quinta). Some of the generators that stood to benefit had donated to Battin's campaigns. One--Windtec Inc.--gave Battin a $20,000 campaign donation in 1999. Others contributed from $3,000 and $5,000 last year. Battin acknowledged that he has received campaign contributions from some wind power generators but said there is no connection between the donations and the bill's provisions. ""It is illegal, it is unethical and it's not how I do business,"" he said. Battin noted that 25% of the state's alternative energy producers are in his district. As Democrats on the Senate Energy Committee blocked the bill, Battin warned that some alternative energy producers might react to the delay by trying to force Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric into bankruptcy. ""We will be the cause of bankruptcy,"" Battin said. That prompted Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) to retort: ""I'm really tired of being threatened with bankruptcy."" Alternative energy producers, including those that use wind, solar power, biomass and other means, produce 27% of the energy used in California. They sell the electricity to the utilities, which in turn transmit it to retail consumers. But with the utilities facing multibillion-dollar debts, the alternative energy producers under contract with Edison have not been paid since November. Scores of alternative energy producers supported the measure. Edison International and the San Francisco-based consumer group, the Utility Reform Network, opposed it. Michael Florio of the Utility Reform group said the deal could result in higher consumer prices; an Edison representative said the same thing. Battin and Assemblyman Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek) worked out an arrangement with many of the generators. Keeley took the lead in the early negotiations, and then turned to Battin to introduce the legislation, SB 47X. Rather convoluted language would have allowed higher payments to a select few generators that produce electricity from wind and biomass. Most of California's wind suppliers, for instance, would have received about 6 cents per kilowatt-hour. But a handful of them, about half a dozen wind farms--mostly in the Palm Springs area represented by Battin--would have received 7.8 cents. Battin contends that other wind producers receive additional payments that boost them to the same level as Windtec and others that would get the higher payments. ""They get the same deal,"" Battin said of the handful of generators that would benefit from the provisions he added to the bill. In California's overall energy market, the amount of money that would have flowed to the favored generators is minor. But the added prices that would have been paid to the generators would have translated to at least $19 million in the next five years, to be absorbed by Southern California Edison customers, according to one analysis. Also Tuesday, more details were disclosed about another leg of the state's effort to escape from the energy crunch--the deals with large power generators to supply electricity to California for as long as 10 years. Those arrangements were announced by Gov. Gray Davis Monday as ""the bedrock"" of California's energy policy. But some consumer advocates warned that the deals could lock the state into excessively high-priced contracts. S. David Freeman, the general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Davis' negotiator, said that the state guarded against that by varying the time spans of its deals. About 6,000 megawatts are expected to be available this summer, about one-third of the energy needed by the state, Freeman said. The amount of power under contract swells until more than 9,000 megawatts are contracted in 2004, half of the needed amount, before dipping to 8,000 megawatts in 2010. ""What we're doing here is what everybody said had to be done,"" Freeman said. ""We deliberately bought 50% so we'd have a good mix between long-term contracts, which may turn out to be somewhat higher or somewhat lower than the spot market,"" and purchases on the spot market. ---- PG&E could face mutiny on outages: SMUD, others may balk if utility orders summer blackouts By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer (Published March 7, 2001) Sacramento's electric utility wants out of a deal that imposes rolling blackouts locally on PG&E's command. So do a lot of other utilities. They've been writing letters, lobbying lawmakers and launching informal talks with Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to get off the hook before summer. Who dodges the blackout bullet ""is going to play out as a political hot button"" around the state, said George Fraser, head of the Northern California Power Agency, a coalition of municipal utilities. In Sacramento, the next volley is expected soon, with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District reportedly poised to notify PG&E that it will no longer black out homes and businesses on the larger utility's command. ""We are absolutely trying to fight off the requirement for rolling blackouts for the Sacramento area,"" said Linda Davis, one of seven elected members of the SMUD board of directors. Saying they don't want to be dragged down by somebody else's problems, two Southern California utilities have written grid operators asking to be exempted from any blackouts caused by PG&E's or Southern California Edison's financial woes. But in PG&E's view, ""California is in an energy crisis (and) ... we're all in this together,"" said spokesman John Nelson. The maneuvering comes amid bleak forecasts for power supplies this summer. Although Gov. Gray Davis has said conservation, new power plants and moderate weather could avert blackouts, officials at the Independent System Operator, which runs much of California's grid, expect frequent rotating outages. One consulting firm, Cambridge Energy Research Associates, predicts 20 hours of rolling blackouts during July and August, and about 200 hours of especially intense calls for voluntary cutbacks. Before blackouts hit, the jockeying over just whose lights, air conditioners and assembly lines will be shut down is growing. The outcome could affect millions of people statewide. The state Public Utilities Commission is probing rolling blackout programs run by the for-profit utilities it regulates, including PG&E and Edison. A PUC analysis has suggested that PG&E's program, which currently exempts about 40 percent of its customers, should spread the burden more broadly. For example, it said, 1.9 million homes and businesses are spared just because they share a circuit with a customer deemed ""essential."" But not-for-profit utilities such as SMUD, which answer to their own elected boards or city councils, have other worries. Many have already lined up their power supplies for summer. Some have raised rates or are considering raising rates. Some have taken extra conservation steps. They think those preparations ought to give them leverage to ease blackout clauses in their contracts with PG&E. SMUD general manager Jan Schori ""is going to use every avenue ... any avenue, to put pressure on,"" including lobbying the ISO, the governor and others, said utility director Davis. The Northern California Power Agency, a joint-powers authority that owns and operates power plants for municipal utilities, has begun informal negotiations with PG&E to change blackout rules, according to Fraser, its top executive. It is preparing to write PG&E, asking that its members be exempted from outages altogether. Failing that, it wants them to face fewer outages or to be compensated for cutting off power, he said. At SMUD, the utility board has met in closed session to discuss exactly what it is required to do during electric emergencies, under terms of the interconnection contract that links SMUD's lines to PG&E's. ""The contracts are being inspected with a fine-tooth comb,"" said SMUD director Howard Posner. Schori declined to comment on any specifics. Sources indicated that the main option being considered is notifying PG&E that because of changed circumstances, SMUD believes it no longer is required to routinely comply with outage requests. Other options being explored include re-negotiating existing agreements with PG&E. Posner said that ever since two days of rolling blackouts in January, constituents have been asking him, "" 'Why are we participating when we're not the problem?' And I don't have a good answer to that."" Several directors said SMUD has already spent a lot of money -- and is considering 16 percent rate increases -- to ensure that it has enough electricity under contract to meet its customers' summer demands. They believe PG&E should do the same. ""We're almost like a David against Goliath here,"" said board vice president Genevieve Shiroma. ""The huge investor-owned utilities next door have severe problems that they need to get under control."" In addition, SMUD plans to argue that because it can cut usage through its ""Peak Corps"" program, which remotely turns off air conditioners at volunteer households, it has already done its part without rotating outages, director Davis said. PG&E believes the interconnection agreements that govern smaller utilities' ties to its transmission lines have ""benefits and burdens to both sides,"" said Nelson. ""It wouldn't be fair or good policy for just one provision to be altered without taking a look at how that affects the entire contract,"" he said. Interconnection contracts generally have clauses that require utilities to help each other out to avert greater emergencies. Sometimes reducing demand -- called load shedding -- can be the only way to stabilize the electric grid in the seconds after a major power plant or transmission line fails. ""It's been around in the electrical fabric forever,"" said Jim Pope, head of Silicon Valley Power, Santa Clara's city-run utility. In addition to legal requirements, ""you have a moral obligation so you don't bring the system to collapse."" Like other city-run utilities, Silicon Valley Power has a contract with PG&E that requires it to shed load during an electric emergency. But its contract allows it to work with big users to reduce their demand, so no one has to be completely shut off. Such agreements, formed long before deregulation when PG&E ran the north state's grid, now are complicated by the 1997 creation of the state Independent System Operator. The ISO today runs pieces of the grid owned by PG&E, Edison, and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. If it believes power use is about to surge past supply, potentially triggering a grid collapse across the western United States, the ISO notifies the three utilities that they have to shed a certain number of megawatts. The big utilities meet that requirement two ways. They cut circuits to some of their own customers, and they tell smaller, connected utilities to cut a proportionate share. In Northern California, about 80 percent of the outages are borne by PG&E customers and the rest by customers of SMUD and other municipal utilities and irrigation districts. ""In one sense, we are all in this together. If SMUD were in danger of going down, we would hope others would help us out,"" said SMUD's Posner. ""But that's if we're in danger from circumstances beyond our control, not from mismanagement or lack of financial wherewithal."" It is unclear what penalties, if any, a utility would face for violating an interconnection agreement. In the long run, the issue would be fought either in the courts or before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, grid officials said. As a practical matter, in the seconds when the risk to the grid is greatest, if one utility refused to shed load, the ISO would probably solve to problem by calling on PG&E, Edison or others who are willing to make deeper cutbacks, they said. ---- PUC to Decide Fate Of Utility Workers PG&E, Edison want to trim costs by laying off thousands, cutting service Bernadette Tansey, Chronicle Staff Writer Wednesday, March 7, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle State regulators are set to decide today whether debt-ridden Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison can conserve cash by laying off thousands of workers and letting service standards slip. Union officials who protested the layoffs before the California Public Utilities Commission warn that if the cuts go through, neighborhoods hit by power outages could stay dark for hours, and more customers could face busy signals when they call about their bills. An administrative law judge agreed, advising the commission in February to order the utilities to restore 725 positions already cut and block the elimination of an additional 2,125 jobs. Judge John Wong said PG&E and Edison have acknowledged the layoffs will not substantially improve their shaky financial condition, which arose from skyrocketing wholesale electricity costs the utilities could not pass on to consumers under a rate cap. ""The savings would barely make a dent,"" Wong said in his draft decision. The two companies together claim that their debt from power purchases amounts to more than $13 billion. PG&E says it has saved $18 million from the first wave of 325 layoffs. Wong's recommendation is already running into resistance on the PUC. Commissioner Richard Bilas said the five-member panel should not be micromanaging the utilities in a time of crisis. Bilas has proposed an alternate ruling that would allow the utilities to make the cuts, but provide for PUC monitoring of service in case the commission wants to step in later. ""We're in a situation where the utilities are not collecting the revenues they need to operate, and yet we may be guilty of not letting them cut expenses where they can cut expenses,"" Bilas said. PG&E spokesman Jon Tremayne said savings from the layoffs are helping to keep electricity running and gas flowing. ""It keeps cash in our accounts so we can keep doing day-to-day business,"" Tremayne said. In addition to the 325 positions dropped so far, PG&E is proposing to cut an additional 675 during the next three to six months. The cuts affect temporary and contract workers who read meters, handle new service hookups and replace equipment. PG&E has no plans to eliminate permanent positions. The company is struggling to keep up with a higher workload at its call center as customers deluge the lines with inquiries about their rising bills and the effects of deregulation. Calls to PG&E ballooned from 1.3 million in January 2000 to 2.3 million in January 2001. Bilas advocates granting PG&E's request to temporarily relax standards requiring the utility to respond swiftly to customer calls and to read customers' meters once a month. PG&E wants to read meters bimonthly and send bills based on the estimated use between readings. Discrepancies could be corrected later. Wong called those measures unacceptable. He said customers need to know immediately if their efforts to conserve power are working. Wong also said the utilities' own experts have said the workforce reductions will lengthen the time required to restore power after nonemergency equipment failure. Eric Wolfe, communications director for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 1245, said some customers have already been left without power overnight because PG&E is trying to avoid the use of overtime on nonemergency power outages. ""It hurts a lineman to walk away from the job leaving a customer without power,"" Wolfe said. Tremayne said PG&E is trying to minimize overtime costs, but denied the company has allowed customers to go without power out of financial concerns. He said crews were pulled out when darkness and falling trees made the work too dangerous. ---- Power prices could soar during the summer Posted at 10:35 p.m. PST Tuesday, March 6, 2001 BY STEVE JOHNSON Mercury News Unless Gov. Gray Davis arranges significantly more long-term electricity contracts or persuades people to turn off a lot more lights, California's unpredictable spot market for power could wreak havoc this summer. Even with the 40 long-term deals announced by Davis on Monday, experts interviewed Tuesday said, up to 43 percent of the state's daily needs may have to come from this highly volatile market, in which power is bought within a day of need. That could could prove hugely expensive, because some spot market energy has cost five to six times what it would under the long-term contracts. It's widely expected that consumers ultimately would have to pay that tab, which could amount to billions of dollars. And because that power won't be locked up in contracts, there is no guarantee it will be available when it's needed, which could lead to blackouts, according to a recent report to the California Independent System Operator, which oversees three-fourths of the state's power grid. ``The situation in California could reach catastrophic proportions,'' the report concluded, adding that unless things change dramatically, ``it is a virtual certainty that peak demand will go unmet during many hot summer days.'' Steven Maviglio, Davis' press secretary, conceded Tuesday that the spot market could be troublesome. ``It's a major concern,'' he said, which is why the state is trying to line up more power contracts, speed up power plant construction and promote conservation. During the normally hot month of August, peak daily demand for power in the Independent System Operator's territory is expected to hit about 47,700 megawatts -- enough for nearly 48 million homes. The state's three main utility firms generate about 8,200 megawatts and have long-term contracts from wind, solar and other energy sources for about 11,700 megawatts more. That totals about 20,000 megawatts. Add in the 7,000 megawatts of long-term power that Davis has announced for this summer, and the state is still nearly 21,000 megawatts short. Costly proposition If all that power has to be obtained on the spot market, the price could be high. On Friday, last-minute purchases on the market averaged $411 per megawatt-hour, compared to about $150 per megawatt-hour for all power obtained by the Independent System Operator and $69 per megawatt-hour on average under Davis' long-term contracts. It's possible that not all 21,000 megawatts would have to be purchased on the market. Assuming Davis is successful in getting people to save 10 percent -- which could prove difficult -- conservation could reduce peak demand by nearly 5,000 megawatts. California also might be able to trade for another 5,000 megawatts with the federal government's Bonneville Power Administration and a hydroelectric operator in British Columbia, said Arthur O'Donnell, editor of California Energy Markets, a trade publication. Under such deals, those two outfits often send that much power to California when they don't need it and California returns the same amount or more when its demand is low. But O'Donnell said it wasn't clear whether 5,000 megawatts would be available this summer, because ``they still haven't gotten the snowpack they need in the Pacific Northwest,'' which could limit that region's generating capacity. Still falling short Even if those hydropower imports are available and conservation works as Davis hopes, it's likely California would still require the spot market for 11,000 megawatts to meet the August demand. That's more than 20 percent of the state's overall power needs. ``All of the surrounding states are buying probably less than 5 percent, at most, of their energy on the spot market,'' said Frank Wolak, a Stanford economist, who monitors electricity prices for the Independent System Operator. He worries about how much that power could cost and is disturbed that state officials haven't adequately addressed the issue. ``No one has any idea what they are going to do, and that is part of the problem,'' he said. Officials at Pacific Gas & Electric Co. are particularly concerned. They fear that their company -- which is nearing bankruptcy -- could get stuck for much of the spot market purchases by the Independent System Operator, which has threatened to bill the utilities for the cost. Fearing the annual bill for that power could hit $2.4 billion this year, PG&E wants the tab sent to the Department of Water Resources, which also is buying power on the spot market for the state. But the Department of Water Resources has objected to that idea and the matter is expected to be heard today by the California Public Utilities Commission. ``We're looking for clarity on a number of issues'' regarding how the spot market will work ``and certainly that's one of them,'' said Thomas Hannigan, the water agency's director. ``I don't think anybody knows the answer of who's going to pay for it,'' added PG&E spokesman John Nelson. But Nettie Hoge, executive director of the Utility Reform Network in San Francisco, said she suspects consumers ultimately will foot the bill. The unfortunate likelihood about spot market purchases is that ``ratepayers are responsible for all of it eventually,'' Hoge said. ``It's a very big problem.'' ---- Power Plant Plans Cause Conflicts East county residents blast supervisors Jason B. Johnson, Chronicle Staff Writer Wednesday, March 7, 2001 Industry dreams of building new power plants in east Contra Costa's hills are prompting an angry reaction among residents and elected officials who say they don't want more plants. The conflict was sparked by a vote by county supervisors yesterday to aggressively explore possible sites for new power plants throughout the county. The measure by Supervisors Mark DeSaulnier and Federal Glover, which passed on a 4-to-0 vote, directs the county administrator and Department of Community Development to compile a report on possible sites within 45 days. Supervisor Donna Gerber abstained after criticizing the plan for potentially repeating the same mistakes that plagued the state's energy deregulation effort by not considering how much energy the state, region and county will need in future years, and how much power is slated to come online. Gerber said alternative power sources, such as solar, should also be examined. A site drawing much attention is on top of a deposit of natural gas near the Concord Naval Weapons Station off Highway 4. The owners of 70 acres of land near the station recently formed a company, Golden State Power Co., to pursue construction of at least one small peaker plant and a much larger facility capable of producing 600 megawatts. The site could hold up to three small 50-megawatt peaker plants, and a larger 15-acre natural gas plant, said Steve Thomas, managing partner with Golden State. No land use applications have been filed. Thomas said 30 acres could be kept as open space to form a buffer around the project. ""Both (facilities) are state of the art,"" said Thomas. ""We believe that the site is ideal."" But east county residents at yesterday's meeting blasted the supervisorial measure and the power plant proposal, complaining that more plants could put people's health at risk. The region already is home to six power plants. ""We're going to get a good dose of poor air quality and (negative) health conditions from this,"" said Concord resident Evelyn Frietas. ""I think we need to stop and think about what we're doing to our quality of life."" Dan Torres said the home he bought in 1995 at a new Bay Point development would be alarmingly close to the proposed Golden State site. ""It will be dragging emissions over our home,"" said Torres. ""I didn't buy a home on that hill to be surrounded by power plants."" There are six power plants in operation in east Contra Costa. Pittsburg already has two power plants, and two more under construction. City Council members Frank Aiello and Yvonne Beals said the Antioch-Pittsburg area has done more than its share of energy production. Aiello said Pittsburg will soon produce enough energy to power three million homes in California. ""When is enough, enough?"" asked Aiello. ""Pittsburg has shouldered responsibility for a land-fill and two more power plants. At some point you have to say enough."" Beals said that while power plants have added millions to the city's general fund, the negatives of additional plants could outweigh the benefits. ""I don't think that Pittsburg or east county should be the dumping ground for energy for California,"" said Beals. ---- Supervisors set search for power plant sites The board also heard from the potential developers of a 650-megawatt plant between Bay Point and Concord By Thomas Peele TIMES STAFF WRITER MARTINEZ -- Contra Costa County supervisors took tentative steps Tuesday toward allowing the construction of at least one small power plant before summer, ordering that its staff identify potential sites in unincorporated areas within seven weeks. The board voted 4-0 to search for locations. Third District Supervisor Donna Gerber abstained, saying her colleagues lacked a ""comprehensive context'' to identify sites. ""I think the board knows just enough to be dangerous,'' she said. Gerber said the county should examine the potential for additional power plants within its borders but not investigate individual sites yet. But Fourth District Supervisor Mark DeSaulnier said the action was necessary because of the energy crisis and because of Gov. Gray Davis' call for local governments to help speed the construction of so-called ""peaker plants"" before July and August. ""I wouldn't do this except under an emergency,"" DeSaulnier said after the vote. ""There are unusual circumstances. We're not talking about putting this in a residential area."" Fifth District Supervisor Federal Glover backed DeSaulnier, but said he hoped for a location outside his heavily industrialized East County district. ""There's a lot of concern in East County as to the number of plants,"" he said. DeSaulnier said, though, that the only logical place for a small plant remains the ""industrial belt'' stretching along the waterfront from West County to Antioch. He declined to provide specifics, but said the only other potential site outside the industrial areas was the Concord Naval Weapons Station property. But he quickly added that he believes the U.S. Department of Defense ""would never go for it."" Also, DeSaulnier said he could not rule out the county building the plant itself and entering the electricity-selling market during peak demand times. Board Chairwoman Gayle Uilkema called that idea extremely premature and unlikely. ""That's a very powerful decision. I do not think we are ready,'' she said. The California Energy Commission listed the Equilon refinery in Martinez as one of 32 potential ""peaker plant"" sites in the state last week. Peaker plants kick in during peak usage times. Davis called for their quick construction before the height of summer and its energy demand for air conditioning. Plants that generate as much as 50,000 megawatts don't need Energy Commission approval. DeSaulnier said he believed a peaker plant could be built about a month after final approval. Supervisors also heard from the potential developers of a 650-megawatt plant between Bay Point and Concord. Walnut Creek commercial real estate developer Steve Thomas announced his intentions for the site north of Highway 4 last week. Construction could take two years. Eric Hasseltine, a consultant representing Thomas and what he described as a ""brand new"" company for the site, the Golden State Power Co., told supervisors that if they intended to speed peaker plant construction they should do what they can to expedite the larger plant. The Thomas site could house a peaker plant until the proposed larger one goes online. A large natural gas line passes under the site. DeSaulnier seemed cautious about the larger proposal, which he had described last week as ""a good site."" Uilkema, too, said she knew too little about it to comment. A resident who lives near the Thomas property asked the board to ""build it (the larger plant) closer to where you have industrial areas. You have to carefully consider the people"" who live nearby, said Dan Torres, 39. Evelyn Freitas of Concord said she lives downwind of the proposed site. ""Our air quality is going to be worse then it is now,"" she said. Gerber played on the environmental issues, saying the county already ranks second statewide to Los Angeles in volume of hazardous materials and amount of electrical generation. ---- Peter Schrag: California's $90 billion infrastructure gap (Published March 7, 2001) By now, California's surreal energy mess has grown from a crisis to a condition. It may not be quite as permanent as, say, death and taxes, but it's still something that could get a whole lot worse before it gets better. Until there's more realistic pricing, no gubernatorial pea-under-the-shell buyout scheme will solve it. Beyond the energy crisis, however, and in many ways similar to it, California faces a whole range of other infrastructure problems -- in transportation, in water resources and sewer systems, in school and university buildings -- that seem, once again, to be all but forgotten. The Business Roundtable has estimated the need at roughly $90 billion, though no number can possibly be exact. What's certain is that after a burst of high-level investment in public facilities during the 1950s and 1960s, California's annual capital investment has sunk precipitously -- from an annual $150 per capita in the 1960s, according to a set of recent studies for PPIC, the Public Policy Institute of California, to about $30 in the 1990s. But you probably don't need to tell anyone driving Bay Area or Los Angeles freeways or looking at the ubiquitous portable classrooms, those dreary brown boxes that house a fourth of our public school students. Ever since passage of Proposition 13 in 1978, we have been flying the flag of deferred maintenance. As in the state's electricity crisis, however, there's no way California can effectively address those problems merely by building or bonding itself out of them. In highway construction, in developing water resources, in finding enough university space to accommodate the Tidal Wave II of students, managing demand is likely to be as crucial to any solution as new construction. In the energy market -- and in electricity particularly -- it's been a familiar principle ever since David Roe of the Environmental Defense Fund first persuaded Pacific Gas and Electric that a dollar invested in conservation may be worth as much as the same investment in new generation. But in most other sectors of California's infrastructure, state and local, it's a lesson still to be learned. There have been scattered attempts to encourage conservation and reduce demand -- significant reduction in water use, for example, through the installation of low-flow faucets and low-flush toilets; some reduction in traffic by using rush-hour diamond lanes or by adjusting highway or (as in New York) bridge tolls to levels of congestion. But as pointed out by David Dowall, an urban economist at Berkeley, state policy-makers have not really begun to ""consider how demand management strategies can be applied to infrastructure service areas,"" or how the more efficient use of facilities and more realistic pricing -- highway tolls, say, or parking fees -- ""can reduce demand for scarce infrastructure resources."" In any case, says Dowall in one of the PPIC reports, we should pick which major projects we will build not just according to per capita estimates of how much we need, but according to how much consumers are willing to pay for them. To avoid hurting the poor, congestion-related highway tolls and other tariffs can be rebated on the basis of income. University fees can be means-tested. In California, they also could be adjusted to encourage summer school classes and other off-peak uses, rather than (as in the past) making UC summer courses more expensive. Given the political and economic uncertainties, there's no way to know how far such demand management can be taken. But there's not much doubt that, as Dowall and others point out, the state's infrastructure planning is a jumble of uncoordinated agency agendas and wish lists. The Legislature last year passed a bill, AB 1473, by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, that requires the governor, beginning next year, to submit an annual five-year infrastructure plan for state agencies and public schools, along with recommendations on how to fund it. In addition, Gov. Gray Davis' infrastructure commission is expected to recommend better coordination of infrastructure and land-use planning when it issues its report this spring. That would be a start. As California State Treasurer Phil Angelides has pointed out, the state desperately needs to start joint planning -- regional planning -- for housing, roads and other resources to reduce the need for long commutes; to preserve open space; and to bring jobs to where people live and housing to where the jobs are. That would itself reduce demand for more freeway lanes and, equally important, improve the quality of life. At present, most planning for housing, roads, water systems and other facilities rarely recognizes the regional impact of local decisions. In the East Bay, slow-growth forces push well-intended initiatives that would force more development into Tracy or Modesto and further tax the transportation systems to Silicon Valley. In city after city, there are beggar-thy-neighbor efforts to grab yet another shopping mall that produces a little extra sales tax revenue for the city that gets it, and that often compounds traffic and revenue problems in adjacent communities. In higher education we divide bond proceeds evenly among UC, the California State University and the community colleges even though the community colleges serve eight times as many students as UC. We plan road projects according to county, not regional, priorities. It is all done according to antiquated political and fiscal formulas that often no longer make sense. We don't just need better capital planning; we need a whole new planning system. ---- PG&E power plan debated at hearing A PUC meeting on the utility's capacity expansion project for the Tri-Valley follows weeks of protest from officials, residents Power upgrade in valley debated By Megan Long TIMES STAFF WRITER SAN FRANCISCO -- Dublin officials and the developer of a Livermore subdivision faced questions Tuesday about their opposition to alternative routes of PG&E's controversial Tri-Valley power upgrade plan -- and answered by restating their long-standing objections. Tuesday's cross-examination came during the third and likely final week of the California Public Utility Commission's evidentiary hearings on the utility's $91 million Tri-Valley 2002 Capacity Increase Project. It has followed weeks of protests of PG&E's upgrade plans by officials and residents of Livermore, Pleasanton, Dublin and San Ramon. And before the questioning started, Dublin Vice Mayor Janet Lockhart reiterated concerns about an alternative route deemed ""environmentally superior"" that would place a substation just 1,000 feet north of Interstate 580 between Tassajara and Fallon roads. She said that would undermine the results of a 15-year process to plan the eastern development of the city. ""It's extremely important to the residents of our community to follow a plan we worked hard to produce,"" she said. Dublin officials favor PG&E's proposed placement of the station three miles north of the freeway, away from new high-tech company offices and housing developments. Besides the Dublin substation, the project calls for construction of a substation in North Livermore, expansion of the Pleasanton substation and installation of 23.5 miles of new lines. In response to questions from PUC Administrative Law Judge Michelle Cooke, Dublin's public works director, Lee Thompson, confirmed that the Lin family, the owner of the property where the alternative substation would go, wasn't interested in selling the land to PG&E. Cooke also asked Thompson to define a ""discretionary permit,"" which is how city officials said they might treat a permit for a substation. Lee said that type of permit is one the city has the right to approve or not depending on the project's impact. Eddie Peabody, Dublin's community development director, testified that the zoning for the Lin property accommodates uses such as commercial business, research and development and light manufacturing. It would not, he said, be appropriate for a power substation. He said parcels within the East Dublin area that could host a station would include those zoned for public and semi-public uses, including land recently bought by Oracle and Sun Microsystems for new campuses. While Dublin officials testified that one buyer of land in that area paid $86 per square foot, others suggested land prices would be inflated to help make a PG&E land buy look prohibitively expensive. An executive of Centex Homes, the developer of new houses near Isabel Avenue and Concannon Boulevard, objected to an alternative route that would place high-voltage transmission lines overhead along Isabel and Stanley Boulevard. David Barclay, president of Centex's Northern California division, said that the 80-foot to 150-foot towers would have a severe visual impact on residents of the Prima tract. Ed O'Neill, a lawyer for the Kottinger Ranch Homeowners Association, pointed out that existing distribution lines on 50-foot poles on Isabel already mar the view for residents. The Foley family has been ranching on land south of Pleasanton city limits for years, said their attorney Kennedy Richardson. The utility's project would place overhead lines and a transmission station on rolling hills that the family envisions as one day being public open space with limited development, Richardson said. Lawyers for Pleasanton, Livermore, Kottinger Ranch and Centex are scheduled to cross-examine a PG&E engineer today about the project's routing. That testimony should be the most controversial of the hearings. Judge Cooke is expected to recommend an alignment by July to the PUC, which will make the final decision. ---- NEWS State OKs 'Peaker' Power Plant at SFO / Temporary generator could be sending electricity to 50,000 homes by August Marshall Wilson 03/08/2001 The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL Page A.20 (Copyright 2001) State energy officials yesterday approved plans to build a temporary electrical plant at San Francisco International Airport that should generate enough juice to power 50,000 homes by August. Meeting in Sacramento, the Energy Commission voted 4-0 to give the green light to the gas-fired plant. It will operate during peak summer and winter demand to help the state avoid Stage 3 power alerts and rolling blackouts. Texas-based El Paso Merchant Energy Co. won approval under a new state law mandating speedy, four-month reviews of so-called ""peaker"" plants. It was the only one of seven applications statewide to win approval. The other proposals were withdrawn for various reasons. The 51-megawatt plant, formally called the United Golden Gate Power Project, is scheduled to be built at the northwest corner of the airport near the United Airlines maintenance center. Within the next few weeks El Paso plans to apply to build a 571- megawatt, $400 million plant in the same area, company spokesman Jesse Frederick said. It would undergo a separate review by state energy officials. The small ""peaker"" plant approved yesterday is to generate electricity beginning around Aug. 1 for up to three years. After the end of three years, the plant would be closed or converted to a cleaner-burning system. Under state law, a temporary ""peaker"" plant is permitted to spew more air pollution than a permanent plant. El Paso's temporary plant is to be built next to a co-generation plant operated by United Airlines. It would use existing connections for natural gas and water supplies and tap into existing power transmission lines. Electricity generated by the plant would be pumped into the state's electrical grid, Energy Commission spokesman Gary Fay said. It would also serve as a backup for San Francisco Airport in case of a blackout. No one spoke against the proposed plant at yesterday's commission meeting. The proposal, however, has been criticized by area residents and environmentalists worried about air pollution. Scott Buschman, a professional photographer and San Bruno resident, said yesterday it was unjust that state officials 100 miles away in Sacramento approved a Texas company's proposal to put a power plant on land owned by San Francisco. ""The fact that they approved it without considering the public's concerns, foremost air quality, is very disturbing,"" he said. Fay said the plant complies with clean-air standards. Answering the criticism about the location of yesterday's deliberation, he said three hearings and several workshops were held in communities near the airport.

Davis's Plan To Power California --- State's Outlays for Electricity May Be Hard to Recover Without Rate Increases --- Betting on Long-Term Deals By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Rebecca Smith, Mitchel Benson and John R. Emshwiller 03/08/2001 The Wall Street Journal A1 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Earlier this year, Gov. Gray Davis made what may be the biggest bet in the history of the nation's biggest state: that he could tame an out-of-control electricity market and avoid devastating blackouts without busting the state's budget, antagonizing its consumers or derailing his own political career. His wager is still on the table, but the assumptions that underlie it are looking increasingly shaky these days. The governor has already spent around $2 billion of public money buying hugely expensive wholesale power, taking over the role formerly played by the state's near-bankrupt electric utilities. And California will probably be obliged to spend billions more before its electricity market stabilizes and those utilities are restored to some semblance of financial health. Under the governor's plan, California aims to recoup the money it is using to buy electricity by issuing $10 billion in bonds. That way it would still have a healthy budget surplus to finance new spending on roads, schools and other public services. But there's a potentially big obstacle to this plan. The state Legislature, worried about racking up billions in new debt, has put limits on the size of any bond offering. In broad terms, the Legislature's action would allow the state to borrow only four times as much as it can recover annually from utility customers. Right now that doesn't appear to be much. Under the current rate structure, essentially set in place by California's flawed 1996 electricity-deregulation plan, consumers pay far less for power than the cost of acquiring it on the wholesale market. Preliminary estimates submitted by utilities last month to the California Public Utilities Commission show the state's share of the proceeds from electricity sales this year could be as little as $241 million -- not enough to support even $1 billion in bond sales under the Legislature's formula. That would leave the state on the hook for much of the money it has already paid for power -- not to mention the billions more Gov. Davis will need to spend. That, in turn, raises the prospect that California's economy and its credit rating both could deteriorate significantly. But state finance officials say that, based on their own projections, they will be able to extract enough money to support a $10 billion bond issue. Walking a careful line between fiscal prudence and political survival, Mr. Davis and others in his administration are scrambling to come up with ways to get around the legislative restrictions without raising rates for consumers. ""If I wanted to raise rates, I could solve this problem in 20 minutes,"" Mr. Davis says. The governor says he believes that the state can obtain enough affordable power through long-term power-supply contracts to avoid the need for a big rate increase. The billions of dollars the state hopes to borrow would be used to help pay for power until electricity prices drop, as they are expected to do when new power plants come online over the next few years. The Davis administration fears that what may be its only other option -- a big increase in retail electric rates -- could prompt angry consumer groups to seek new electricity laws through a statewide ballot initiative during next year's election. That's when Mr. Davis is expected to run for a second term as governor. But trying to save California without rate increases is forcing Mr. Davis to make some colossal gambles with the state's money. State officials estimate that in the next several months, California will need to spend as much as $6 billion on power purchases -- equivalent to the state's entire fiscal surplus. Mr. Davis is also looking to spend several billion more to buy the transmission assets of three investor-owned utilities in order to restore two of them to credit-worthiness. He also has announced plans to spend several hundred million dollars more on conservation programs designed to reduce demand while new power plants are being built in the state. In order to limit the state's financial exposure in the meantime, the governor and his aides have, in some cases, ignored state law. They have threatened appointed officials who have stood in the way. And they have sharply restricted the flow of information to the public. None of those steps is expected to do much to reduce state spending on power in the coming months. In a few weeks, power usage is expected to begin a sharp seasonal rise as Californians switch on their air conditioners with the coming of warmer weather. By various estimates, demand during peak periods this summer could outstrip supply by 10%, or several thousand megawatts. That could produce more rolling blackouts like the ones that hit Northern California earlier this year. It is also likely to put strong upward pressure on wholesale electricity prices. Steven Zimmerman, managing director of Standard & Poor's Corp., says Mr. Davis and his aides don't ""have a lot of time"" to put a cap on the state's financial exposure to the crisis. The credit-rating agency has put the state on credit watch for a possible downgrade, which would affect the value of all of California's outstanding public debt. Moody's Investor Service Inc. is also concerned. It said in a recent report that the power crisis could soon ""seriously threaten the health"" of the state's economy. Mr. Davis, a Democrat and career politician, was dealt a bad hand when he took office in 1999. The deregulation plan that sparked the state's electricity crisis was enacted under his predecessor, Republican Pete Wilson. But Mr. Davis was slow to react to early signs of trouble this past summer and alarms sounded by members of the state Legislature. By the time Mr. Davis finally sprang into action earlier this year, a troublesome power-supply squeeze had escalated into a crisis. In a Jan. 17 declaration of emergency, the governor designated the state Department of Water Resources to take the utilities' place as the daily buyer of huge quantities of electricity. His hope: that by making the state the dominant player in California's power sector, he would ease electricity producers' concerns about getting paid and give the state enough clout to negotiate lower long-term power prices. Earlier this week, Mr. Davis announced final or tentative agreements with 20 power suppliers to furnish the state with a total of 8,900 megawatts for periods of as long as 20 years. But the supply situation remains extremely uncertain for this summer, when demand probably will top 45,000 megawatts. If the state can secure enough power under contract and push down demand through aggressive conservation, it might be able to squeak through the summer season. If not, it will be forced to keep buying huge amounts of costly power in the cash market. Under deregulation, retail electric rates were frozen for several years, while wholesale-power costs were free to fluctuate. When the plan was conceived, wholesale prices were low and expected to go lower. However, a combination of unexpected growth in power demand and a lack of new generating capacity helped produce a supply squeeze. Average wholesale prices more than tripled last year from 1999. And in January those prices were up 10-fold from a year earlier. By then, California's two biggest investor-owned utilities -- the Pacific Gas & Electric unit of PG&E Corp. and the Southern California Edison subsidiary of Edison International -- faced imminent financial collapse. They had racked up billions of dollars in wholesale power bills they couldn't afford to pay. As generators began shying away from selling to the two utilities, the Clinton administration forced them to sell power into the California market, an order left in place during the first weeks of the Bush administration. Still, northern California was hit by rolling blackouts on several days in early January. Since then, the DWR, which does some electricity trading as an adjunct to its main mission of managing the state's giant system of aqueducts and reservoirs, has had to learn the ins and outs of power markets on the run. It hasn't been easy. David Mills, trading-floor manager for the federal Bonneville Power Administration, says the water agency has at times offered to pay $50 to $100 per megawatt hour more than the available market price. ""They agree to prices that make you wonder,"" says Mr. Mills, whose organization markets electricity from federal dams in the Pacific Northwest. ""You'd at least think they'd check to see what the prevailing price is before throwing out their offer."" Mr. Mills says that ""to cut California some slack,"" he occasionally has instructed his traders to sell at prices lower than the DWR had offered to pay. Ray Hart, the water agency deputy director responsible for the power purchasing, says he isn't aware of any cases in which the DWR has overpaid. He says his team has been ""extremely successful by all measures."" Ultimately, the DWR's trading acumen is far less important than the overall arithmetic of power supply and demand in California. With the price of natural gas that feeds many of the region's generating plants at near record levels and some suppliers reluctant to sell into the troubled California market, wholesale electric prices remain stubbornly high and, in recent days, have again been rising. The Legislature has advanced the DWR about $3 billion from the state's general fund for power purchases. Under emergency legislation passed by the Legislature and signed by Mr. Davis on Feb. 1, the general fund is to be reimbursed from a planned bond sale later this year. But under terms of the emergency law, the water agency would have to wrest $2.5 billion a year in revenue from retail electricity rates in order to sell the $10 billion worth of bonds sought by Mr. Davis. Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, a Southern California Democrat, says the formula was created to ensure that there would be a way to repay the bonds without draining the state's coffers. ""We didn't want to just open our wallets,"" he says. According to the language of the Feb. 1 law, the water agency gets what's left of revenue collected from ratepayers after the utilities pay certain of their own power-supply bills and other expenses. And, in their filings with the PUC last month, the utilities reckoned, under their worst-case scenarios, that there would be only $241 million available to the DWR this year. State officials are quietly pushing the PUC to rejigger the formula so that the water department gets more money -- even though that would clash with terms of the Feb. 1 law. Robert Miyashiro, deputy director of the Department of Finance, says the emergency law was ""drafted poorly"" and has led people to believe the DWR ""only gets the leftover money."" He predicts there will be ""cleanup legislation."" At the request of the Davis administration, the PUC is considering a plan to use a different revenue-sharing formula than the one in the state law. The proposed new formula was written ""in close consultation"" with Mr. Davis's Finance Department, says PUC President Loretta Lynch, who supports the initiative and is hoping to rush it through. The effort has drawn some opposition. Commissioner Richard Bilas at a recent PUC meeting questioned the legality of the commission attempting to change a formula set by the Legislature. PG&E is even more emphatic, since the DWR's extra money could come at the utility's expense. The formula ""threatens to undo the very financial protections for the utilities that [the new law] attempted to provide,"" the utility said in a recent filing with the PUC. As politicians and regulators wrestle with that issue, the Davis administration has taken a step to reduce the outflow of state cash that also seems to conflict with the Feb. 1 law. It was widely assumed that the law required the DWR to buy any electricity the state needed to keep its lights on. However, on many occasions, the DWR has refused to buy power on the grounds that it was too expensive, citing a portion of the new law that urges the agency to hold down costs. The task of covering any remaining shortfall has passed to the California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's energy grid and is charged with buying power when necessary to avert shortages. However, the ISO doesn't have any power-purchasing money of its own, and the major parties it would normally bill are PG&E and Edison, whose inability to pay their power bills was the reason the state started buying electricity in the first place. Amid criticism of its stance from generators, utilities and Wall Street, the DWR says it has started covering more of the utilities' electricity costs. The water agency is now buying 95% to 99% of what California needs in a given day, says the agency's Mr. Hart. But increased buying only adds to the uncertainty about the eventual tab. The state's legislative analyst, Elizabeth Hill, recently recommended that lawmakers hold off considering more than $2 billion in state spending on items ranging from college construction to beach cleanups because of continuing questions about the financial impact of the electricity crisis. Like others, Ms. Hill complains that the governor's office and state agencies haven't been forthcoming with information. Indeed, the DWR refuses to say precisely how much power it is purchasing and at what prices, though it has on several occasions gone back to the Legislature for more money. State officials say that data on its purchasing activities would give suppliers an advantage in continuing electricity-supply contract talks. State Controller Kathleen Connell, who is running for mayor of Los Angeles in an April election, recently announced plans to post state power-spending information on her department's Web site. But within 24 hours, Ms. Connell suspended that plan after discussions with senior Davis administration officials. ""I feel very strongly that this information should be publicly released,"" says Ms. Connell. ""I just don't want to do anything that would weaken the state's effectiveness in negotiating."" In an effort to more tightly control events, the governor obtained legislative approval to abolish the 26-member ISO board, which was made up of everyone from utility executives to representatives of consumer groups. He then appointed a new five-member board. To ensure a quick transition, the California attorney general threatened the old board members with fines of as much as $5,000 each if they didn't immediately relinquish their positions. All did. ""I was offended"" at the ""heavy-handed"" treatment, says Karen Johanson, a former ISO board member. One of the first acts of the ISO's new board was to close a meeting about the electricity crisis. The former ISO board routinely held such meetings in public. ISO attorneys say the meeting was largely designed as a private briefing for new board members and that the organization is committed to keeping its deliberations as open as possible. The Wall Street Journal and other news organizations have unsuccessfully challenged the closure in Sacramento state court. Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Gray Davis' demand for $8.9 billion in refunds was too high and that a= =20 settlement probably would be in the range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion.=20 The disclosure that Wagner had contemplated a much higher figure midway=20 through the negotiations suggests the state had more support than the judge= =20 let on Monday when he said after the talks foundered that he thought a deal= =20 should involve ""hundreds of millions, maybe a billion"" dollars.=20 While the state wants $8.9 billion, $3 billion of that was for overcharges= =20 during the five months preceding last October and are beyond FERC's scope o= f=20 review.

TIM REITERMAN TIMES STAFF WRITER July 11 2001 SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge Tuesday reaffirmed his decision to bar a= =20 ratepayers committee from Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s bankruptcy case and= =20 denounced the committee's attorney for suggesting that the action could=20 prevent PG&E customers from receiving refunds for excessive energy charges. Judge Dennis Montali ruled against a U.S. trustee and the ratepayers=20 committee in deciding that ratepayers as a group had no claims and were not= =20 creditors when PG&E filed for bankruptcy on April 6. But Montali criticized ""misguided remarks"" by a committee attorney on July = 5=20 and news media accounts that followed the hearing. The judge said the repor= ts=20 left the misconception that by disallowing a ratepayers committee, he would= =20 reject all claims of ratepayers and they could lose out on future refunds. The judge and PG&E officials emphasized that there are no matters involving= =20 PG&E customer refunds before the state Public Utilities Commission. State officials are seeking about $9 billion in refunds, however, from the= =20 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for alleged overcharges to Californian= s=20 by energy companies since last year. The distribution of any ratepayer refunds would be decided by the PUC, and= =20 customers would be paid whether or not they filed Bankruptcy Court claims b= y=20 a Sept. 5 deadline, the judge and PG&E attorneys said. The judge took the highly unusual step of directing PG&E and U.S. Trustee= =20 Linda Ekstrom Stanley to consider remedies to allay any confusion among=20 PG&E's 5.5 million customers. He suggested publishing clarifications in newspapers that carried the=20 erroneous information, in PG&E customer bills and on Web sites. Stanley had formed a ratepayers committee of business, government and=20 consumer representatives, saying they will be affected by PG&E's Chapter 11= =20 reorganization. But Montali decided that ratepayers do not qualify as creditors under=20 bankruptcy law and are not entitled to official status that allows them to= =20 participate in the bankruptcy and receive funding from PG&E.

Wednesday, July 11, 2001=20 Lights go out on Davis' power show=20 Three new developments show that some economic reality finally is being=20 applied to California's electricity crisis:=20 First, ""The nation's chief energy judge said Monday that California is owed= =20 maybe $1 billion in refunds from power generators, a fraction of the $8.9= =20 billion demanded by Gov. Gray Davis,"" reported the Register yesterday. Even= =20 that $1 billion amount might be balanced by the amount the state still owes= =20 the power producers.=20 To suggest workable and market-oriented solutions to the California=20 electricity crisis. Judge Curtis Wagner's recommendation will be taken up by the Federal Energy= =20 Regulatory Commission, which is being petitioned for the money by the state= =20 of California.=20 Because the judge's words will bolster FERC's apparent desire not to grant= =20 the ""refunds,"" the state probably will go to court, where the matter could = be=20 stuck for years. ""In the long term, this may indicate that competitive electricity has a=20 future even in California, but not thanks to the state,"" Robert Michaels, a= =20 professor of economics at Cal State Fullerton, told us. He's referring to t= he=20 state's botched 1996 ""deregulation"" effort, which has been made worse by Go= v.=20 Gray Davis and other officials since the crisis began a year ago. ""FERC since the 1980s favors competition, within the parameters of politica= l=20 reality,"" Mr. Michaels added. ""Now we're at square one: The industry doesn'= t=20 owe $9 billion to California."" As this process continues, he said, another= =20 positive aspect will be that a lot of facts will get aired. ""We'll see what= =20 has been happening in the markets"" in which power is bought and sold. Second, light already is shining on one area: This crisis was not ""Made in= =20 Texas'' by cronies of President Bush, as Gov. Davis and other Democrats hav= e=20 been contending.=20 In May, the governor attacked the president for ignoring ""the greed of thes= e=20 Texas energy companies,"" such as Reliant and Dynergy. In fact, according to information on state power contracts the governor=20 finally released Monday, Texas companies were way down on the list of=20 producers.=20 ""In roughly the first five months of the year, the state shelled out $1.2= =20 billion to Atlanta-based Mirant, the most any company was paid for=20 electricity, followed by $1 billion to Powerex, the marketing arm of BC Hyd= ro=20 in British Columbia [in Canada]. It also paid $331 million to the Los Angel= es=20 Department of Water and Power,"" reported the San Jose Mercury News. Only about 10 percent of our state's power during this period came from=20 companies with headquarters in Texas. Third, and finally, a new study by the Cato Institute shows what should be= =20 done next:=20 lAbolish retail rate caps, allowing prices to be set by the market.=20 This would be a better system than the present one, where the state buys th= e=20 electricity and passes much of the cost along through the state budget (pai= d=20 by taxpayers) and bonds paid for by long-term electricity price increases.= =20 Higher immediate prices would encourage conservation and production, leadin= g=20 in time to lower prices. lMove to real-time pricing so people shift activities such as washing to=20 off-peak hours.=20 lAbolish the Independent System Operator, which moves electrons around.=20 Give this function back to the utilities, who did it far better before=20 ""deregulation.""

Exhbits in a FERC case require supporting documents and a sponsor (witness). I am trying to contact various people on getting the data together but here are the parameters of the exhibits: Witness designations are preliminary. 1. EPMI's receivables from ISO/PX What it shows: ISO owes us $41.5 million and the PX $9.1 million plus any claims we want to make w.r.t. letters of credit with the PX Sponsor: Tracy Ngo (PX data) and Murray O'Neil (ISO data) (Tracy has agreed to prepare the exhibit but wants support from Murray's group on the ISO numbers.) 2. EPMI's ""receivables"" from ISO for the underscheduling penalty What it shows: ISO has yet to actually implement the underscheduling penalty but has been tracking it. According to information provided Chris Stockly, EPMI would receive $30 million of penalty revenues Sponsor: Chris Stokley or Murray O'Neil 3.

Unfortunately, that process has not been finalized and as such, Dutch is not yet an associate. Ted is finalizing the process this week and it will likely require Dutch to interview with 4 other commercial managers outside of ENA. Additionally, there are two other sr. spec. on the gas trading floor in similar situations and we will be discussing them at a promotion meeting to be held the first week of Jan. I would like to handle all of these consistently and had planned to include Dutch's promotion in this discussion. I would recommend that we hold on a title change for Dutch until after this meeting and manage it through the promotions process.

Subject:: Fwd: Portland Consultant's Investigation Finds California Has
 Capacity for Electricity Needs
Body:: FYI Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable Date: Tue, 17 Oct 2000 08:53:16 -0500 From: ""Tracey Bradley"" <tbradley@bracepatt.com> To: ""Deanna King"" <dking@bracepatt.com>, ""Paul Fox"" <pfox@bracepatt.com>, ""Ronald Carroll"" <rcarroll@bracepatt.com> Subject: Portland Consultant's Investigation Finds California Has Capacity for Electricity Needs Mime-Version: 1.0 Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII Content-Disposition: inline FYI - It sounds like this consultant's findings are being questioned by many in the industry, including by the CAISO. Portland, Ore.-Based Firm Says California Has Capacity for Electricity Needs Dan McSwain , North County Times, Escondido, Calif. ( October 17, 2000 ) Oct. 13--PORTLAND, Ore.--A private investigation of state power markets has come to the conclusion that California had plenty of electricity generating capacity this summer. The state enjoyed a 32 percent reserve margin even as wholesale prices soared and the state's power manager declared 36 separate ""power emergencies"" because California was thought to be in the grips of a critical shortage, according to the investigation. The author of the investigation's preliminary report, Portland-based economist and utility industry consultant Robert McCullough, said at a conference of analysts, power traders and electricity industry regulators Thursday that he has found evidence that generators and trading companies manipulated the production of power from June through August to create a false shortage and push up prices. The Encina power plant in Carlsbad provides a stark example: it ran at well below its full capacity for much of June, even though wholesale power prices ---- and consumer electricity bills ---- shot to well above the generating plant's cost of production. The actual production of electricity by the plants was determined by an analysis of data from the Environmental Protection Agency, which monitors emissions. ""We are seeing a lot of under-generation,"" McCullough said. ""This is market power in action."" Market power is a term used by economists to describe the ability of market participants -- in this case suppliers -- to influence prices. Many of the industry experts present at the conference Thursday reaffirmed their belief that supply shortages were very real this summer, and contributed to high prices, but several participants said deregulation has reduced the amount of market information that is available to analysts. Mainstream economists have questioned the accuracy of data from federal agencies, including the EPA. Conventional explanations for the low energy production observed in San Diego County are scant. Encina's operators, a joint venture of energy giants Dynegy Inc. and NRG Energy Inc. called Cabrillo Power, confirmed that the power plant had no abnormal maintenance problems. The San Diego Regional Air Quality Board said Wednesday that the power plant was well within its state-mandated pollution limits. But David Lloyd, the corporate secretary of Cabrillo, denied that the Encina plant has been used to game the San Diego County power markets. ""That can't possibly be right,"" Lloyd said of McCullough's analysis. ""In North County, we were right on the ragged edge of being off (an emergency shutdown because of heavy output). ""Without knowing the specific details of time and which units were on or off, I can't comment,"" Lloyd said. ""We certainly don't want to be accused of anything wrongful,"" he said. ""We don't have that much power in California, and for us to be shutting down in California to push up the price somewhere else doesn't make sense for us. We want to run all we can when the prices are high."" Electricity prices have soared to record levels since May, resulting in a doubling and tripling of power bills this summer for the 1.2 million customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Co. and causing an estimated $5 billion in losses for Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric. State lawmakers have intervened on behalf of San Diego County consumers with a retail rate cap, but the law in turn created a looming IOU that could grow beyond $300 million if high wholesale prices persist. No fewer than five private, state and federal investigations are under way to assess the competitiveness of power markets in the interconnected Western states. The investigations also seek to answer charges that the companies which produce and trade electricity have either figured out how to exploit deregulated markets to outmaneuver regulators or have engaged in outright manipulation in order to increase profits. Inquiries by the California Public Utilities Commission, Electricity Oversight Board and attorney general, along with a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission investigation, were launched in July and August. Staff investigators of the state and federal commissions said this week that they are still in the process of issuing subpoenas and gathering market data. McCullough was hired in late May by the Seattle city utility and a consortium of large industrial power consumers in the Pacific Northwest to investigate the price spikes. His effort is thought to be the first to complete an exhaustive analysis of state and federal information that tracks the amount of electricity that was available and compares it to the amount of power that was actually used. Chief among McCullough's findings was that demand for power was lower this summer than what was forecasted by the Western Systems Coordinating Council, a federal agency that is charged with ensuring the stability of the vast web of power transmission lines that connect California to 13 other Western states, British Columbia and northern Mexico. McCullough provided a copy of his preliminary findings Tuesday to the North County Times, and the initial reaction of the state's energy community was one of deep skepticism. ""EPA data is notoriously unreliable,"" said Frank Wolak, a Stanford professor and the chairman of the market surveillance committee of the California Independent System Operator, the agency that manages the state grid and which has paid enormous sums for emergency power this summer. To gauge the actual output of power plants that burn fossil fuel, McCullough used emissions data from the EPA. ""Greed would get the best of anybody,"" Wolak said. ""I found a lot of hours where in-state generators were exceeding nameplate capacity. These guys were cranking it out."" Wolak, in a study of power markets for the system operator, did conclude, however, that exercise of market power by power generators and traders was the major cause of higher prices this summer. At the conference in Portland, most of the panelists did not openly criticize McCullough's analysis, but implicitly disputed his conclusions by attributing higher prices and the presumed exercise of market power to a very real shortage of electricity generating capacity among the Western states. Low hydroelectric production in the Pacific Northwest and high temperatures in the Southwest were blamed for limiting California's ability to import electricity. Others said state and federal regulators, along with market participants themselves, won't really know what happened until more experts look at hard market information that is in short supply. Ron Eachus, the chairman of the Oregon Public Utilities Commission, said market information is routinely withheld from regulators, the public and buyers of electricity, but is shared among power generators and trading companies. ""If the market is sharing it with themselves, but not us, I don't buy that,"" Eachus said. Tim Belden is the vice president of West Trading for Enron North America, the largest marketer and trader of electricity in the world. Enron takes the unique stand that more information which has been labeled ""proprietary"" by companies, such as when a plant is being run and how much the electricity is selling for, should be made available instantly to the markets. ""Is there a smoking gun out there or are market participants behaving rationally?"" Belden said. ""California is characterized by secret, black box market models that nobody understands,"" he said. ""If you've got nothing to hide, release the data."" ----- To see more of the North County Times, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.nctimes.com (c) 2000, North County Times, Escondido, Calif.

Phillips and Laura Heinauer Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal 03/07/2001 The Wall Street Journal A2 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) WASHINGTON -- Angry and confused that a Republican administration has targeted one of their favorite programs for big cuts, America's largest exporters are appealing for help from lawmakers. Boeing Co., Caterpillar Inc., Enron Corp., Halliburton Co. and others are launching an aggressive lobbying campaign on Capitol Hill to protect the Export-Import Bank from budget reductions; the White House labels the Ex-Im Bank as corporate welfare. ""The administration has fired its shot, and now we're firing ours,"" said Edmund B. Rice, president of the Coalition for Employment Through Exports, an industry group that is leading the effort. Since they got wind of the proposed cuts a few weeks ago, business lobbyists have been trying to rally sympathetic lawmakers. And executives at Boeing, Caterpillar and other big companies plan to contact some 100,000 smaller suppliers that benefit indirectly from the $12.6 billion of export loans, guarantees and insurance that Ex-Im Bank provided in the last fiscal year. Those small companies, the executives hope, will create a groundswell of support in Congress for the Ex-Im Bank. ""Companies large and small who have similar interests here are banding together to provide an educational effort so people understand the impact of this,"" said Chris Hansen, Boeing senior vice president for government relations. Corporate lobbyists also have dug up a speech that Vice President Dick Cheney, while chief executive of Halliburton, gave in 1997 praising the bank and scoffing at those who consider it a giveaway to big business. They plan to pass Mr. Cheney's comments to influential members of Congress this week. ""We'll be circulating them very broadly,"" Mr. Rice said. A spokeswoman for Mr. Cheney had no immediate comment. Ex-Im Bank officials aren't talking publicly, avoiding the appearance that they are battling the White House to overturn the proposed 25% cut in the bank's $865 million operating budget for the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. But an Ex-Im official said the topic has come up in conversations between key lawmakers and Ex-Im Bank Chairman James A. Harmon, who is soon to be succeeded by Mel Sembler, a Bush campaign fund-raiser and a shopping-center developer. At first, business lobbyists assumed administration budgeteers were just looking for savings anywhere they could find it. Before President Bush released his spending plan last week, companies appealed to Mitchell Daniels, head of the White House budget office, in an attempt to keep the Ex-Im Bank cuts out of the final proposal. The Ex-Im Bank's corporate clients include some of the country's largest political contributors. Boeing, the bank's largest user, received $3.3 billion of financing last year. The Seattle aerospace company and its employees contributed $1.8 million to politicians and parties during the 2000 election cycle, 61% to Republicans, according to federal election data assembled by the Center for Responsive Politics. Caterpillar, a Peoria, Ill., maker of engines and heavy equipment that secured seven Ex-Im Bank deals last year, and its employees contributed more than $500,000 -- 96% to Republicans. Company officials deny they wanted to leverage donations to try to secure political support for the Ex-Im Bank. Many lobbyists have come to the conclusion that administration officials -- those of a libertarian persuasion -- oppose Ex-Im Bank as a form of welfare for corporations. Indeed, the White House budget plan criticized the bank's operations as unjustified public subsidies for companies. ""That makes it a much more serious issue,"" Mr. Rice said. ""We're concerned that the administration seems to be turning its attention in this direction."" Barring intervention from Mr. Cheney, business groups now have largely given up hope of convincing the White House to back down, planning instead to use their muscle to convince Congress to restore the Ex-Im Bank's funding. Bank officials and U.S. companies argue that, far from being a subsidy, the bank simply allows American companies to compete with European and Japanese firms that receive assistance from their own governments. ""In many markets in Asia and Africa, the bank is absolutely critical to our ability to sell American-made products,"" said Bill Lane, Caterpillar's Washington director for governmental affairs. --- Corporate Beneficiaries Top 10 recipients of Ex-Im Bank loans, guarantees and insurance for fiscal year 2000, as measured by amount of financing, in millions Boeing $3,335 Bechtel Group $1,075 Distributed Processing Systems $388 Willbros Group $387 United Technologies $334 Raytheon $156 General Electric $150 Halliburton $136 Enron $135 LSI Logic $120 Source: Ex-Im Bank Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Dutch Gas Competition Grows Despite Sluggish Reforms By Germana Canzi Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 03/07/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) LONDON -(Dow Jones)- The Netherlands is emerging as an important testing ground for E.U. gas liberalization, as new trading hubs for competitive, short-term gas supplies from the U.K. and Norway emerge on the Belgian and German borders. However, much remains to be done. A group of large energy users and traders is preparing to confront Gasunie Thursday in a hearing organized by the regulator. The main issues of contention are the balancing system, which Gasunie conducts on an hourly basis, the extent to which transport tariffs are cost-focused and third-party access to storage facilities. The emergence of competition in the Dutch gas sector is mostly due to the initiative of new market entrants who, despite a difficult regulatory environment, have managed to develop a market for short-term gas virtually from scratch. If liquidity improves in these emerging hubs, the Netherlands could become an important transit country for freely tradeable gas supplies to other countries in northwest Europe, as well as being an important market in its own right. However, the difficulty of implementing transparent third-party access systems in the Netherlands and in neighboring Germany casts a dark cloud over recent progress in competition. Since December, Enron Europe Ltd. (U.ENE), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK), E.On AG (EON), RWE AG (G.RWE) and Electrabel SA (B.ELE) have been actively buying and selling gas, sourced in the U.K., the Netherlands and Norway, in a number of hubs between Emden in Germany and Emshaven and Oude Statenzijl in the Netherlands. David Gallagher, head of European gas trading at Enron in London, estimates that at least one trade a day of around 100,000 therms for a quarterly contract is done at the Oude Statenzijl hub, where the Gasunie pipeline system connects to the network of Wingas GmbH. An important element kick-starting short-term trading was the sale, in December 2000, of a 2 billion cubic meter a year Norwegian gas supply contract to five Dutch-based power generators. Robert van der Hoeven, head of fuel procurement at Electrabel, the owner of Dutch generator EPON, said his company uses most of the gas it imports from Norway for its plants in the Netherlands and trades the rest on a short-term basis in the Oude-Emden area. This pattern is common to the other Dutch-based parties to that contract. Trading in Dutch hubs received a further boost when Nederlandse Gasunie NV (N.NEG) decided, after months of wrangling with regulator DTe, to lower its transport tariffs by 6.5% from January 2001 and to unbundle its combined commodity and service tariff, the so-called CSS system, from July 2001. Gasunie now claims its pipeline system is fully open and transparent. To prove this, it says it has lost 30% of its customers in the eligible market, but that figure hasn't changed much since March 2000. Small wonder that critics say the switching figure doesn't necessarily indicate an ideal system of third-party access. According to energy consultants The Brattle Group, around half of the gas used by alternative suppliers goes through the 1 bcm/year Zebra pipeline from Zelzate to Zeeland, which was built by Dutch utilities a few years ago precisely because Gasunie refused to provide access on favorable terms. Shippers have complained that the hourly system used by Gasunie to balance the pipeline system raises the overall cost of shipping through its network significantly. Gasunie imposes a balancing charge which effectively forces shippers to pay for the extra gas brought into the system from storage sites, in addition to the capacity and transmission price. Critics say Gasunie has so far failed to unbundle these charges, although it agreed to do so in January. According to the Brattle Group, another controversial aspect of Gasunie's tariff system is that it is based on theoretical costs of constructing new pipelines rather than its actual costs. The DTe is also considering ways of reforming the storage system to make it competitive. BP PLC (U.BP) and Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij NV operate storage facilities and lease capacity to Gasunie through long-term contracts. The regulator is studying ways of allowing third parties access to storage facilities. Gasunie has so far shown little sign of negotiating more competitive tariffs with storage operators and passing on the benefits to customers, critics say. The growth of short-term trading in the Dutch gas market is also inevitably linked to its potential as a transit country for gas coming from the U.K.-Belgium gas interconnector and going towards the 82bcm-a-year German market. Market participants say liquidity at the Emden and Oude hubs has grown considerably since E.On and RWE started trading there earlier this year. However, the obstructive attitude of incumbents toward third-party access there has meant that so far most gas traded in the Netherlands has remained there. -By Germana Canzi, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 20 7842 9283; germana.canzi@dowjones.com Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Ex-Im Bank officials were not talking publicly, avoiding the appearance that they are battling the White House to overturn the proposed 25 percent cut in the bank's $865 million operating budget for the current fiscal year, which ends Sept 30, it said. The White House labels the Ex-Im Bank as corporate welfare. ""The administration has fired its shot, and now we're firing ours,"" Edmund Rice, president of the Coalition for Employment Through Exports, an industry group that is leading the effort, was quoted as saying by the paper. Executives at Boeing, Caterpillar and other big companies plan to contact some 100,000 smaller suppliers who benefit indirectly from the $12.6 billion of export loans, guarantees and insurance that Ex-Im Bank provided in the last fiscal year, the paper said. Those small companies, the executives hope, will create a groundswell of support in Congress for the Ex-Im Bank, it said. New York Newsroom (212) 859-1700. Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

WASHINGTON -- Angry and confused that a Republican administration has targeted one of their favorite programs for big cuts, America's largest exporters are appealing for help from lawmakers, Wednesday's Wall Street Journal reported. Boeing Co. (BA), Caterpillar Inc. (CAT), Enron Corp. (ENE), Halliburton Co. (HAL) and others are launching an aggressive lobbying campaign on Capitol Hill to protect the Export-Import Bank from budget reductions; the White House labels the Ex-Im Bank as corporate welfare. ""The administration has fired its shot, and now we're firing ours,"" said Edmund B. Rice, president of the Coalition for Employment Through Exports, an industry group that is leading the effort. Since they got wind of the proposed cuts a few weeks ago, business lobbyists have been trying to rally sympathetic lawmakers. And executives at Boeing, Caterpillar and other big companies plan to contact some 100,000 smaller suppliers that benefit indirectly from the $12.6 billion of export loans, guarantees and insurance that Ex-Im Bank provided in the last fiscal year. Those small companies, the executives hope, will create a groundswell of support in Congress for the Ex-Im Bank. Corporate lobbyists also have dug up a speech that Vice President Dick Cheney, while chief executive of Halliburton, gave in 1997 praising the bank and scoffing at those who consider it a giveaway to big business. They plan to pass Mr. Cheney's comments to influential members of Congress this week. A spokeswoman for Mr. Cheney had no immediate comment. Ex-Im Bank officials aren't talking publicly, avoiding the appearance that they are battling the White House to overturn the proposed 25% cut in the bank's $865 million operating budget for the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. But an Ex-Im official said the topic has come up in conversations between key lawmakers and Ex-Im Bank Chairman James A. Harmon, who is soon to be succeeded by Mel Sembler, a Bush campaign fund-raiser and a shopping-center developer. Copyright (c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Deal with state could take until 2002 to close By LESLIE GORNSTEIN AP Business Writer 03/06/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. LOS ANGELES (AP) - A tentative deal aimed at rescuing Southern California Edison from insolvency might not close in time to prevent the utility from begging creditors for more patience, Edison officials said Tuesday. The utility's tentative, $2.7 billion agreement to sell its power lines to the state could take until 2002 to be consummated, thanks to complicated legal issues and other paperwork, an Edison official told bondholders Tuesday. Once the deal is signed, Edison will try to borrow against the promised cash, but Edison International Chief Financial Officer Ted Craver admitted the utility might have to ask creditors to simply wait for their money until it has the $2.7 billion in hand. Energy suppliers owed money by Edison did not immediately return calls for comment Tuesday. At least four groups of suppliers have sued Edison for millions in unpaid bills going back months. Edison and fellow utility Pacific Gas & Electric have said they have lost $13 billion on the open power market thanks to soaring prices paired with state-imposed price caps. PG&E's parent company was able to recently borrow $1 billion to pay its stockholders and its debuts. It did not use any of that money to pay PG&E's bills. Edison's disclosure, meanwhile, shocked state officials. Steve Maviglio, spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, initially declined to comment on the status of the Edison deal, but eventually said, regarding its closure, ""We're optimistic it will be sooner rather than later."" The pacing would have nothing to do with whether fellow utilities Sempra Energy and PG&E also sell their transmission lines to California, Craver said. Among the things that could delay the deal's closing is Edison's need to find landowners on whose property its lines were built to assure no legal agreements are being violated by the sale. Edison would also have to pin down exactly what it would be selling to the state - terms that might not be decided until after a deal has been inked, Craver said. ""Trust me,"" Craver said in a phone call after the conference. ""There are a lot of legal-type documents - stuff that you and I ... would think of as a bloody nightmare."" The disclosure comes at a time when an increasing number of power suppliers are suing the utility for millions in unpaid bills. Edison also disclosed Tuesday that two more lawsuits had landed in its lap - one by a group of wind-powered generators including Enron Wind, the other by two suppliers including New York-based Caithness Energy. Both suits were filed during the past five days, Edison Assistant General Counsel Barbara Reeves said. It was not immediately clear how much the complainants were seeking; neither Enron nor Caithness returned calls for comment. The two filings bring the total number of suits by renewable-energy suppliers against Edison to four, the utility said. The city of Long Beach and CalEnergy Operating Group, a geothermal supplier, have also sued for back payments. CalEnergy alone has said it is owed $45 million in November and December payments. The line sale, part of a multifaceted, tentative deal with the state that could save Edison from insolvency, could take anywhere from several months into next year, Craver said. The tentative deal, announced by Gov. Gray Davis Feb. 23, calls for the state to pay more than twice the book value for Edison's lines. It also would require Edison to sell cheap power to the state for a decade and for Edison to end its lawsuit against state regulators. The suit asserts that price caps imposed by the California Public Utilities Commission are illegal under federal law. Additionally, Edison's parent would have to return $420 million it collected from the utility over the past several years. The money was used to pay debt, buy back stock and pay dividends to investors. SCE, PG&E and Sempra have complained they are near bankruptcy because of soaring prices on the open market combined with the state-imposed price caps for consumers. Sempra and PG&E have yet to announce similar line-sale deals with the state, though they and the governor have said negotiations are ongoing. The total cost of the 26,000 miles of lines has been estimated at $4.5 billion to $7 billion. Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Sierra Pacific CEO Doubts SEC OK Of Enron Unit Buy-Report 03/06/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Sierra Pacific Resources (SRP) CEO Walter Higgins said in an interview last week that he doubts the company's $3.1 billion acquisition of Enron Corp.'s (ENE) utility Portland General Electric will be approved by the federal Securities and Exchange Commission, the Las Vegas Sun reported Tuesday. The SEC must find that Sierra Pacific is in a strong financial position before it will approve the deal, but the company is currently weakened by having lost millions of dollars in fuel and purchased power costs, Higgins said in the report. A $311 million rate increase to cover those costs began March 1, but Higgins said that money would only pay back those expenses and wouldn't improve the company's stability to a level the SEC would find adequate, according to the report. The Public Utilities Commission can halt the rate hike and order refunds if it decides the hike isn't necessary. The PUC is holding hearings to determine the prudency of the hike, and members of the state's powerful casino and mining industries have filed to intervene. Sierra Pacific's plan to shore up its financial position through the sale of its 10 power plants, worth nearly $2 billion, may also be in jeopardy. The state Senate is considering a bill to block the sales, and Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn recently sent a letter to the PUC asking that it reconsider its order allowing electric utilities to sell assets. Financial analysts have said that not allowing Sierra Pacific's two utilities to sell their assets would have a ripple effect on the company's financial position. The asset sales are tied to low-priced power contracts, and if the sales are canceled, the low-priced power will be gone as well. ""If the divestiture is stopped...the state may be dealing with a much bigger rate increase,"" Steve Fleishman, Merrill Lynch utility analyst, told Dow Jones Newswires recently. Sierra Pacific is the parent company of electric utilities Sierra Pacific Power Co. and Nevada Power, which serve customers in the state's North and South, respectively. -By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872, jessica.berthold@dowjones.com -0- 07/03/01 01-04G Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Many Power Deals Announced by California Governor Still Not Final By Jason Leopold 03/06/2001 Dow Jones Business News (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) Dow Jones Newswires LOS ANGELES -- Many of the long-term power-supply contracts announced by California Gov. Gray Davis this week remain under negotiation or are the subject of ongoing lawsuits, power suppliers said Tuesday. The lack of finality to the deals raises questions about the state's success in covering its power needs, particularly going into what is expected to be an unusually tight summer. Generators said privately they were surprised the governor went ahead with his announcement Monday, given that many of the contracts haven't been signed. David Freeman, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, who negotiated the contracts on behalf of the state, conceded that details remain to be worked out. ""This is not a done deal,"" Mr. Freeman said, adding that credit concerns are keeping generators from signing the deals. Gov. Davis announced Monday that California has secured 40 long-term contracts that will provide California with about 629 million megawatt hours of electricity over 10 years, at a price of more than $40 billion. A megawatt hour is roughly the amount of electricity needed to power 1,000 homes. Several of those forward deals, however, involve contracts originally held by Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric at the California Power Exchange, previously the state's main power market. The governor seized those contracts earlier this year, just before the Power Exchange liquidated them to cover hundreds of millions of dollars in power bills the utilities had failed to pay. The contracts, which total about 1.3 million megawatt hours of electricity and have a market value of about $1 billion, according to market sources, have yet to be paid for or signed over to the state. Duke Energy Corp. (DUK), one of the suppliers that sold the contracts to Pacific Gas and SoCal Ed, has sued Gov. Davis for unlawfully commandeering those contracts. Although Duke has reached an interim settlement to continue providing power to the state Department of Water Resources until April 30, the company and the Davis administration still have to ""develop a comprehensive long-term settlement to pay for the power supply contracts,"" said Duke spokesman Tom Williams. The governor went ahead with the announcement, because the California Department of Water Resources believes it will be able to finalize and sign the contracts over the next several weeks, Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said. Separately, several suppliers named in the governor's announcement Monday -- including Duke, Reliant Energy Inc. (REI), Mirant Corp. (MIR), Sempra Energy, Enron Corp. (ENE) and Avista Corp. (AVA) -- said they have yet to sign final agreements with the state, although negotiations were ongoing. ""We are working in good faith with the DWR toward a long-term contract,"" said Art Larson, spokesman for Sempra Energy Resources, a unit of Sempra. Mr. Larson said Sempra signed a terms of agreement with the water-resources department and expects to reach a final agreement over the next several weeks. Reliant said it has only signed a short-term contract with the state that expires in about two weeks. The company will only sign a long-term contract once it's paid more than $400 million owed by Pacific Gas and SoCal Ed, spokesman Richard Wheatley said. Mirant said it also won't sign contracts with the state until it's paid. Enron said it's reached agreement on terms with the state, but has some credit-related details to hammer out. ""Everything's been agreed to except for some credit technicalities,"" Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said. Meanwhile, small, independent power plants in California that are capable of generating 1,800 megawatts of power are shut down because their owners haven't been paid by the state's two main utilities, the California Independent System Operator said Tuesday. The decline in small-plant output has contributed to the state's power-supply problems the past two months. Partnerships involving El Paso Corp. (EPG), for example, shut down 350 megawatts of generation last weekend due to nonpayment, the company said Tuesday. SoCal Ed hasn't paid the owners of the smaller generators, known as ""qualifying facilities,"" since early December, which means the generators are still owed for electric production in October, while PG&E has paid only a small percentage of its qualifying facility bills since its last full payment in early January. The plants, one-third of which are powered by renewable sources like wind and solar power, meet almost 30% of California's electricity needs. Almost all of the closed generators are fueled by natural gas, and many haven't been able to pay their gas suppliers and have been cut off from their gas supply. The California Senate Energy Committee plans to vote on legislation to create a new pricing system for all qualifying facilities this week. The proposed bill would cut the prices to qualifying facilities from about 17 cents a kilowatt-hour the past eight months to about eight cents, depending on the price of five-year natural-gas contracts the generators can sign. The plants that run on renewable resources would be paid 5.4 cents a kilowatt-hour. -- Mark Golden contributed to this article.

US Natural Gas Prices Fall As Demand Slips In Most Areas 03/06/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- U.S. natural gas physical prices fell Tuesday as demand eased, except in the Northeast and Southeast areas of the country, traders said. Heavy snowstorms in the upper Northeast supported some pricing, as did cooler weather in Georgia, the Carolinas and the Florida panhandle. Some storage buying occurred in Texas ""if they could make it work,"" a trader said. ""It was a pretty uneventful day,"" a Gulf Coast trader said late Tuesday. Also, because of the snowstorm in the Northeast, traders had purchased gas ahead of time to make up for needed load, he said. A scheduled work outage on Enron's Transwestern San Juan lateral in New Mexico was completed, and the return of a power plant in California alleviated demand in the West, traders said. At the Arizona-California border hub, buyers paid around $13-$33 a million British thermal units, West Coast traders said, down as much as $15 from Monday. At PG&E Citygate, prices were mixed, with buyers paying $9.75-$10.65/MMBtu, down 25 cents on the bid, up 15 cents on the offer. In the Midwest, Chicago Citygate prices fell 7 cents-8 cents to a range of $5.42-$5.53/MMBtu. Alliance Pipeline into Chicago traded around $5.47-$5.52/MMBtu, down 4 cents to 9 cents from Monday. The Nymex April natural gas futures contract settled at $5.315/MMBtu, down 2.1 cents in a tight, range-bound, uneventful session that started late due to bad weather. Physical gas prices at the benchmark Henry Hub in south Louisiana ended in a range of $5.25-$5.30/MMBtu, down 2 cents-6 cents from Monday. Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line at Station 65 deals were made in a similar range of $5.26-$5.35/MMBtu, down 2 cents on the bid, unchanged on the offer. At Katy in East Texas, buyers paid $5.21-$5.30/MMBtu, down 5 cents-6 cents. At Waha, prices fell 9 cents-12 cents to a range of $5.15-$5.30/MMBtu. -By John Edmiston, Dow Jones Newswires; 713-547-9209; john.edmiston@dowjones.com Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

years to cover the costs of the new plants coming on line.=20 In several of the contracts, the state agreed to pay generators a 25 percen= t=20 to 30 percent annual return on their plant construction costs, which could= =20 pay off the entire plant in four years or less.=20 Before deregulation, utilities generally received 3 percent to 18 percent= =20 annual return on their capital investments

Gray Davis said=20 Wednesday.=20 In closed-door Washington, D.C., settlement talks scheduled to conclude=20 Monday, state officials are demanding that energy companies forgo $8.9=20 billion in bills for electricity that the state argues was overpriced.=20 But Davis, during a San Jose visit Wednesday, said the state would consider= =20 accepting some of that refund in the form of cheaper long-term contracts, a= =20 move that could appease critics who say the $43 billion deals cost far too= =20 much.=20 The governor's comments shed light on the state's bargaining strategy in th= e=20 negotiations. Few details have emerged from the talks since the judge=20 overseeing them imposed a gag order.=20 ``We've made suggestions, we've offered various ways in which people could= =20 get us $8.9 billion,'' Davis said. ``We've said it doesn't have to be all= =20 cash. You can give it to us in lower contract prices than you otherwise wou= ld=20 have given to us. You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us=20 money. However you want to do it, it's just got to net out to $8.9 billion.= ''=20 It's unclear how those offers have been received by energy suppliers, who= =20 have insisted their prices were fair given the uncertainty over whether the= y=20 would ever get paid. Several major companies, including Duke Energy and=20 Enron, say they're owed millions of dollars from the state and its major=20 utilities.=20 Paula Hall-Collins, a spokeswoman for Williams Companies, which signed=20 several contracts with the state in February to deliver power over the next= =20 10 years, said she could not comment.=20 But one industry official said it was encouraging to see the governor show= =20 some flexibility and that the concept seems reasonable.=20 ``We take that as a positive,'' said Gary Ackerman, executive director of t= he=20 Western Power Trading Forum, a trade association. ``If he wants to talk som= e=20 trade-off in renegotiating the contracts, that doesn't seem to be totally o= ut=20 of hand. We're not going to turn away any serious offer.''=20 But Ackerman said the state needs to give a little on its refund target.=20 The $8.9 billion, a figure estimated by the state's power grid analysts for= =20 sales from May 2000 to May 2001, has been widely challenged by industry=20 leaders. Even the judge overseeing the settlement talks said it's probably= =20 too high.=20 ``I don't think it serves the state of California for the state to hold fas= t=20 to a number, any more than it does for my members to do the same,'' Ackerma= n=20 said. ``It just doesn't get to a solution. There's got to be some give and= =20 take, and we certainly haven't heard that until now from the governor.''=20 The state began buying electricity in January for its largest utilities aft= er=20 they became so saddled with debt from high power prices that energy compani= es=20 refused to sell to them. The state has spent about $8 billion since then in= =20 daily and short-term purchases.=20 The Davis administration signed $43 billion worth of electricity contracts= =20 with 18 energy suppliers for power over the next 10 years and has dozens of= =20 deals pending.

His chief=20 energy negotiator, S.?David Freeman, has said he's proud of the contracts.= =20 But Davis has faced blistering criticism about the deals from Republican=20 lawmakers, state Controller Kathleen Connell and consumer advocates, who sa= y=20 the contracts will soak consumers with high electricity prices for many=20 years.=20 Davis initially sought contracts at prices around $55 per megawatt-hour, bu= t=20 the deals signed so far average $70 per megawatt-hour.=20 That was a bargain earlier this year when daily prices averaged more than= =20 $200 per megawatt-hour.

Subject:: Thursday Meeting on Winter Gas Prices
Body:: calendar ---------------------- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/NA/Enron on 09/13/2000 08:07 AM --------------------------- Rob Bradley 09/12/2000 11:01 AM To: Kenneth Lay/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Alhamd Alkhayat/NA/Enron@ENRON, Shelley Corman/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT, Gil Muhl/Corp/Enron@ENRON (bcc: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron) Subject: Thursday Meeting on Winter Gas Prices Ken: I have invited the following individuals to join us at the 3 pm Thursday meeting to review the draft of your Columbus speech on the natural gas situation. Hamd Alhkayat--Hamd has replaced Andrew Miles in the rotation and will be helping me with your presentations as well as being the lead with Jeff's speeches. Shelley Corman--Shelley has been developing messages for the current and anticipated gas situation and pipeline safety for the gas pipeline group. (The safety issue could come up in your Q&A.) Stinson Gibner--Stinson is with the research group that has generated some of the more complex slides in your draft dealing with volatility and historic futures pricing. Gil Muhl--Gil markets gas products to customers and is speaking at an AGA conference on the gas supply and price situation the day before your talk. His group is focusing on new products to help end-users with winter volatility. I have asked Gil to send you his presentation as well for the meeting. Back to your presentation (the draft slides of which I am delivering to you today), Dan Yergin thought it would be appropriate for you to give an overview of the situation as the ""teacher"" or ""professor."" Some questions that you could address would include: Where has the industry come from, and what lessons have we learned? How is the business different today? What public policy conclusions are implicit in this history? I think our comparative advantage over the specialists who will be presenting before and after your keynote is that you have ""been there"" in the evolution of the natural gas market, and Enron is at the forefront of helping customers deal with price and supply uncertainty. There is also a good opportunity to stress the need for new industry ""best practices"" (more hedging) and the right public policies to deal with this issue (from ""do no harm"" to expanding incentives in the market). - Rob

Subject:: PRIVILEGED & CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION
 Terminability of Val Verde interconnect agreement
Body:: I've looked into whether we can terminate our Val Verde interconnect agreement with Burlington, and have determined we may do so only if we take the following steps: 1. Terminate the OBA by giving 30 days notice to Burlington. Paragraph 13 of the 6/1/94 OBA with Burlington (as successor in interest to Meridian) provides that either party may terminate the OBA ""at the end of the primary term, or thereafter by providing thirty (30) days prior written notice"" to Burlington. (The one-month primary term ended June 30, 1994 and has since gone month-to-month.) 2. On the effective termination date of the OBA, terminate the interconnect agreement by giving 30 days notice to Burlington. The 12/31/92 Interconnect Point Operating Agreement, Paragraph 6, provides that either party may terminate on 180 prior notice after expiration of the primary term. This is of limited use to us since the primary term does not expire until 12/31/02. However, the paragraph also provides that the agreement ""may be terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days prior written notice in the event the OBA between the parties is terminated."" As we've already discussed, termination of the agreement is an extreme measure from a customer relations standpoint and we probably need to weigh our other options first. Let me know if you have further questions.

It will be heard again tomorrow (perhaps beginning at 10 AM) , at which time parties will have a chance to support/oppose and ask for amendments. Most, including us, oppose unless significantly amended. The Wright (D) -Richman (R) bill (83XX)was heard in an ""informational"" hearing today and still sits in the Assembly Energy Committee. It will be heard again tomorrow, at which time parties will have a chance to support/oppose and ask for amendments. From our perspective, this is the best bill out there yet, though it still has serious problems---it isn't available electronically yet, but should be tomorrow, and I'll distribute then. The chances of the joint D-R bill being successful are slim, however, since it's up against the Speakers competing bill. There is talk that the Speaker will try to negotiate with Wright/Richman tonight and include any agreement in his bill (82XX). The original version of the Governor's MOU bill sits in the Senate. Most believe that Burton will put it up for a vote this week and it will fail. The Senate's version of the MOU (Sher-Peace-Kuehl) (78XX)came out today. It will likely be heard in the committee tomorrow or the next day. Notably, it kills Direct Access completely and makes Edison shareholders responsible for that portion of Edison's debt owed to suppliers. In short, a very bad bill. Burton's 18XX, which would de-link the bond issuance (to pay back the General Fund) from the DWR contracts is likely to pass the Senate tomorrow or the next day. Many--including Enron--support the bill (though we are supporting it behind the scenes). What people don't know: Whether there's the time or the will in the Assembly and Senate to achieve by Friday a single, comprehensive bill that can be sent to the governor for his signature. Whether the Legislature would postpone its month-long recess if the Legislature hasn't finished a bill by Friday (most folks think they will not postpone). Whether it's true that, irrespective of the energy issue, the Legislature will fail to get the budget completed by Friday and therefore have to postpone their recess anyway, in which case they might continue to work on the energy legislation at the same time. Odds-makers still say it's better than 50-50 that the Legislature does not get the Edison bills done by Friday and leaves on on its 30-day vacation. Best, Jeff Sacramento is one goofy place.

Subject: FW: RTO Week -- Summary of Standards and Practices Panel John--this is the recap from Thursday afternoon of RTO week. Although Andy= did not focus on it in his report, there was an individual who sat on the = panel from Missouri that did a fantastic job of supporting FERC and market = postitions despite the fact that he is a public power guy. His name is Bil= l Burks and he is the Associate General Manager of the City Utilities of Sp= ringfield, Missouri.

Cook, NERC Gene= ral Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnes= ota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Co= mpany. =20 General Observations =20 The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left la= te in the afternoon). FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, t= he commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of= all questions. There was a general consensus that standards were needed; = much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seeme= d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo= rward and how far they needed to go. Panelists urged the need to mover for= ward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha= t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t= o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward. There was d= iscussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the= reins in the future. On an interesting tangential note, there was noticea= ble conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two org= anizations somewhat common during the discussions.=20 =20 FERC Deliverables A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne= eded from the Commission. Staffers probed all panelists to find what they = felt was critical. =20 The first major topic was ""How many RTOs? What is their scope?"" All panel= ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b= y FERC, in strong definitive language. N o one offered any specific langua= ge, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement. The next topic was, ""What will be standard market design?"" Panelists varie= d on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent. Some urged f= or one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid sta= ndard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (= followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the curre= nt situation. The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha= t the industry needed to move forward. They continually visited this topic= throughout their discussions, asking questions like, ""Do we need to issue = a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?"" and, ""How much detail do you= need us to provide?"" General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they = wanted strong leadership in this areas. Kormos and Burkes went so far as t= o say FERC should ""Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a= little further."" Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, bu= t in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and t= he need for cautious investigation. =20 One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc= heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th= e ""RTO Design and RTO Implementation"" section would address many of the que= stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design. Korm= os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying = a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry. The se= ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following = questions: ? Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occu= r, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i= s nonetheless efficient? Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there= be others that must be accommodated? ? Transmission Service - Are transmission services required to sch= edule (""covered"" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protect= ing from congestion charges (both ""covered"" and ""uncovered"" schedules are a= llowed)?=20 ? Loop Flows - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission = services appropriate? If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues= to be addressed? ? Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing pr= ior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to reti= re those contracts? Are there other solutions? ? Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function?= Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules)= , be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced sche= dules), or will they be required at all? ? Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed = in standard ways? Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary= services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as fina= ncial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)? ? Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? = Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce= ss, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technical= ly unwieldy? ? Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrate= d into the new world? Should systems be designed with the assumption that = non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO? Or should they be designed to t= reat each NJE as a separate entity? Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica= l questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which = to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions= , pointing out that vague answers (i.e., ""do congestion management"") will t= ake a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., ""LMP with financi= al hedging instruments"") will take only months. The Commission asked Mike = about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible = to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed. Now for a funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) refer= red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati= on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest. Kormos flat out= said, ""My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't = believe that that statement is true."" He then backpedaled a bit and said t= hat it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assert= ion by the Northwest interests was false. NERC and GISB A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-se= tting organization. Massey went so far as to ask, ""Are we looking at a bea= uty contest between NERC and GISB?"" Cook and Boswell then went into severa= l short polite jabs at each other's organizations. Other participants cont= inually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization. Interesting= ly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI= SB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the ""new"" structure of NERC and= did not focus on its history. Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a= sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were= they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?). GISB was easily a= ble to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin= g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Poin= t, Brownell. Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-m= an. He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's suppos= ed ""successes,"" such as TLR and E-Tag. If staffers have tenure, they will = likely remember that these ""successes"" have not been so successful, resulti= ng in several filings and interventions. We may also wish to file comments= in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show= the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction. There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues= , but general consensus was that I could not be done. There was also some = talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB. The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly ur= ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade= rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward. NERC s= omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position. In general, I would= say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top. Let me know if you have any questions.

Subject:: RTO Meeting With Chairman Barton
Body:: Late yesterday afternoon, EPSA's legislative affairs committee (about 10 of us) met with Chairman Barton and staff to discuss his draft RTO language. Meeting lasted 45 minutes. Interestingly, no one was there from either Reliant or El Paso. We had what the diplomats would call a frank exchange of views. Can't say we moved Barton very much, if at all, except we did have a chance to ""go over the staff"" to point out specific flaws in the draft even based on his view of how RTOs should come about (I gave several very specific examples like the 40,000 MW provision and other limits on FERC discretion on size and scope, as well as procedural rights for transmission owners but not the rest of us, etc.). Chairman Barton's fundamental view is that Congress, not FERC, should determine how RTOs come about. And that ""the market"" and ""the industry"" should determine how RTOs are shaped, etc., not FERC. He bristled at one point and said he had more faith in ""us"" than he had in FERC or we had in ourselves to determine how RTOs come about, going so far as to saying that under his draft they would be ""our"" RTOs -- meaning those of us present. I pointed out this is wrong because under his draft the transmission owners, particularly those least likely to join up, would have all the leverage. I said that the basic flaw in the draft is that it assumes there are only two parties to the transaction -- FERC and transmission owners -- forgetting the rest of us, including consumers. He said we could become transmission owners if we wanted to!!! On the 40,000 MW size minimum, he said many ""experts"" had advised them this is the correct number. We said that putting a number in to the statute ran counter to his oft-stated desire for a fair process to produce RTOs driven by market forces, not regulators. The two elements of good news -- Barton reconfirmed that a markup this year is very unlikely AND he expressed that he would not spend too much time on electricity next year if it started to crowd out other issues, like Clean Air Act Amendments and nuclear waste legislation. This suggests a strategy possibility in terms of running out the clock. He said he has the votes by a wide margin to report the RTO draft, but will entertain some changes. He said the only reason he has not marked up the bill is that the Sept. 11th terrorist attacks have taken attention away from the issue and subcommittee members are not engaged on the issue. He said those of us who support could roll the dice with them, but that there are things that only Congress can do -- like getting all transmission owners into RTOs -- and that these statutory changes are so important that we should not oppose the draft.

Body:: -----Original Message----- From: ""Frank A. Wolak"" Sent: Friday, October 19, 2001 4:28 PM To: Kaminski, Vince J Subject: Vince, I've been hearing rumors that Enron has decided to endorse the nodal pricing model as implemented in PJM. I just wanted to warn you that I'm not sure this is in Enron's long-term interest at all. Let me explain why. Feel free to give me a call if you'd like to talk more about this. First, let me say that I firmly believe in locational pricing and specifically pricing congestion. However, the way that PJM implements nodal pricing is to eliminate as much price volatility and reduce the transparency of the market. Specifically, the PJM tariff gives the ISO the ability to mitigate to cost plus a %10 adder the bids of any market participant that the ISO deems is out of merit in one of the three zones in region. (The fact that a nodal market is talking about zones should give you cause for alarm.) Then the ISO takes this mitigated bid and re-runs its price-setting software to compute new nodal prices. The way I have (somewhat unfairly) decribed this price-setting process is that the PJM ISO decides what prices it would like for a given day and mitigates bids until it gets them. This is not a transparent market, nor one where it makes any sense to buy the risk management services that Enron provides. The only price volatility you have to worry about in the PJM market is that kind that comes about if they need imports into their control area to meet demand. Under these circumstances, you need to pay the imports whatever is necessary to get them to come to your market. However, bear in mind FERC's desire to make a large RTO on the East Coast. This will effectively mean little imports to the East Coast RTO, so all bids can be mitigated at the discretion of the ISO. Paying market-clearing prices to cost-of-service mitigated bids is just paying too much to eliminate price volatility. It effectively kills off the development of risk management at the wholesale and retail level. Power marketing becomes much less profitable because retailers know you can always buy at cost-mitigated prices. In short, the PJM model is not market. It is just an alternative form of regulation that is politically attractive because it reduces price volatility, but it is not good for consumers or traders because they just get a higher cost form of regulation than traditional cost-of-service regulation. You pay market-clearing prices to cost-of-service mitigated bids, but under regulation you could just pay cost-of-service prices and eliminate the infra-marginal profits to low cost generators. As we discussed during our dinner, I think the two biggest sources of benefits from re-structuring will come from getting the demand-side involved in the market and from more efficient risk management. A necessary condition for both of these to occur is prices that reflect actual conditions in the market (including the extent of market power exercised). Masking these signals dulls any incentive for market participants to make the investment necessary to management. The PJM model is just way to have a market in name without achieving any significant benefits to consumers or energy traders. Frank

Admit it: The only comic re= lief in this energy crisis has been watching our leaders go at suppliers a= nd each other like pro wrestlers or Jerry Springer guests. In his St= ate of the State address last January, Gov. Gray Davis accused the big pri= vate electric power generators of legalized highway robbery and threatened= to seize their plants if necessary. Then he really got angry, calling the= m ""the biggest snakes in the world."" This past week, Atty. Gen. Bill Locky= er boosted the rhetoric a notch by declaring he would like to personally e= scort the chairman of Enron Corp. ""to an 8-by-10 cell that he could share = with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi, my name is Spike, honey.""' Meanwhile, = President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney have blamed California for c= ausing its own problems with a ""harebrained"" deregulation scheme and mocke= d the state's power purchases and conservation programs. It's been fun. No= w it's time for our leaders to act like adults. Davis and Bush alwa= ys will have their political differences, but the economies of both the st= ate and the nation are endangered by California's energy situation. These = leaders need to work together as cooperatively as possible, starting next = week when Bush makes his first visit to California as president. Da= vis wrote Bush Wednesday offering to meet with him during his California v= isit. Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said the president looks forward to dis= cussing energy and other issues. Good start. Let's hope the conversation i= s civil and that the civility spreads. No matter how much California= has been abused by the power companies, and it absolutely has, the state = still needs them to help solve the crisis caused by shortages of electric = power generation this year and next. Usually, the biggest targets of offi= cial and public wrath are the investor-owned utilities such as Southern Ca= lifornia Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric Co. But not this time because, = in the view of the state, the utilities have been bled dry by the power ge= nerators' stratospheric prices. The state had to take over the purchase of= power when the generators refused to extend any more credit to Edison and= PG&E. Legal recourse should be pursued, but the threatening rhetoric need= s to subside.

Subject:: Re: Confidential --CFTC Chair
Body:: do not circulate; fyi ----- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/NA/Enron on 02/14/2001 02:28 PM ----- WGramm@aol.com 02/14/2001 07:58 AM To: Steven.J.Kean@enron.com cc: Subject: Re: Confidential --CFTC Chair Hi Steve, Folks love Newsome, and I think he's very nice and appears to be very free market. Spears, the other Republican appointee is not at all free market, in my view. I would not like this to mentioned anywhere else, but I have found that the farm reps on the Commission may sound deregulatory but are not, and have been really troublesome without a good free market person on board. And there are no truly free market persons on board at the Commission (every single other agricultural rep that I worked with on the Commission were trouble, even though they claimed to be deregulatory -- and they were far worse before I got there and after I left.) I visited with Newsome a day before Inauguration, and I was appalled at what they were planning to do concerning agency structure -- that would have elevated the regulatory lawyers and diminished the role of the economists at the agency. Misguided and showed to me a lack of understanding of how organizational structures can affect what comes out of an agency. I am often at odds with ""the industry view"" regarding CFTC issues. I don't think the futures exchanges, who have a lot of power, necessarily are pro-competition; and many of the non-exchange folks who lobby on CFTC issues are Washington or New York (Democrat - which is why they want to involve Ken at this level) lawyers who do not understand markets and who are more interested in being able to claim influence or impact. The CFTC is in awful shape -- the quality of staff is horrendous, and the Commission is relying on some of the worst people for their policy work (same folks that Brooksley Born used, same folks who have advocated more regulation of the OTC market for years). Many quality folks do not want the job as Chairman because it's been such a backwater. I am looking for some good folks. Have at least one person who would be good at that job. And it's not Newsome. Please do not share this information with the usual folks, as they hate me anyway (I'm too free market and have argued against their ""fixes""). Sorry for this scathing review, but this is an important appointment. Wendy

Subject:: RE: United India - strictly confidential and privileged
Body:: I got your copy kicked back to me for some reason. ---------------------- Forwarded by Michelle Blaine/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on 01/31/2001 09:01 AM --------------------------- Michelle Blaine 01/31/2001 08:53 AM To: Ken cc: ""Williams, Justin"" @ ENRONRichard Sanders, Bruce Robert C Subject: RE: United India - strictly confidential and privileged I think Justin answered your question about governing law and the first arbitration hearing and I am going to find out from Atul about whether Indian law governs these policies since Indian law requires us to have an Indian fronting policy. On another issue that came up on the call this morning Ken, I was asking Justin about governing law specifically because I wanted to know if there was any law (India or English) requiring insurers to disclose information regarding risk to the insured, so we could cite some law perhaps to compel Beachcrofts to hand over the Liburdi report. For example, the Texas insurance code has evolved from a vague ""duty of good faith & fair dealing"" standard in some instances to specific laws preventing insurers from doing certain things detrimental to the insured. Justin tells me English law, in this regard, consists only of precedential case law, but it still could be helpful. Because of the commercial risk (outside the ambit of arbitration in the instance) it might be worthwhile to consider going into the London Commercial Court to seek some sort of extraordinary relief to prevent United India from withholding this information which is critical to running these machines. If, in fact, there truly is a 50% chance of failure in these machines, yet they won't share that evidence with us, this is a commercial risk DPC can't afford, regardless of coverage and apart from the arbitration. (I'm wearing my commercial hat instead of my legal hat today). Although Justin expressed concern about jurisdiction, United India did us the favor of bringing suit in London Commercial Court earlier, and thus having availed itself to the courts and having Peter Hirst's emphatic witness statement that makes a compelling case for the court to take jurisdiction, I think it is worth considering if they continue to refuse to give us the report in response to Justin's latest correspondence. I don't think we can afford to sit on our hands on this one. Why don't you and Neil kick this around, (since you don't have enough to do already). Cheers, Michelle Ken Blades 01/30/2001 08:42 PM To: Michelle cc: ""Williams, Justin"" @ ENRON Subject: RE: United India - strictly confidential and privileged I assume governing law is an issue that would be raised at the initial procedural hearing. If this is something that we're serious about then we ought to get after it immediately. Michelle Blaine 01/30/2001 11:15 PM To: ""Williams, Justin"" @ ENRON cc: Ken Subject: RE: United India - strictly confidential and privileged No wonder I couldn't remember the governing law! Yes that is a good idea to determine which law is more favorable to our position. Let's mention that to Ken tomorrow as we may want to have Atul Rajadhyaksha look at that for us. I think originally we discussed that notion but its been a long time ago. Thanks Justin, Michelle ""Williams, Justin"" on 01/30/2001 09:11:26 AM To: ""'Michelle.Blaine@enron.com'"" <Michelle.Blaine@enron.com> cc: ""Heneghan, Diane"" Subject: RE: United India - strictly confidential and privileged Michelle, I know the problem about cases and clauses running together! The position on the insurance is that it does not specify a governing law. On an application of English private international law (ie conflict of laws rules) there is uncertainty whether it would be English or Indian law. At para 42 of Hirst's statement, he says that the contracts are impliedly subject to English law (based on London as the arbitration forum?). Certainly, my preference in terms of certainty would be English law. However, it is possible there could be an advantage to Indian substantive law and once we get UI's statement of claim, we should give thought to whether it would be worthwhile getting Indian law input on whether there could be advantage in arguing Indian law. I will ask Diane to add this to the ""to do"" list!

Subject:: Fw: Tagging issue at NERC Security Subcommittee tomorrow
Body:: ----- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/NA/Enron on 09/26/2000 04:20 PM ----- ""Duncan Kincheloe"" <dkincheloe@mpua.org> 09/26/2000 10:22 AM To: <skean@enron.com> cc: Subject: Fw: Tagging issue at NERC Security Subcommittee tomorrow Steve, ? I sent the below to you this morning at an apparently outdated email address.? Your secretary was kind enough to update me so I'm forwarding it again. ? Duncan Kincheloe General Manager and CEO Missouri Public Utility Alliance 573-445-3279 Fax 573-445-0680 ----- Original Message ----- From: Duncan Kincheloe To: Steven Kean Sent: Tuesday, September 26, 2000 10:01 AM Subject: Tagging issue at NERC Security Subcommittee tomorrow Steve, I haven't been in touch since the DOE Reliability Task Force and hope this email address through Elizabeth is still the way to reach you.? Incidentally, I was with Sue Tierney at a NARUC conference yesterday and we've started a new pool to wager when Congress will get this issue dealt with. Want in? Perhaps you remember that while we were serving on the Task Force I moved to EPRI to direct their government relations.? Last year I moved back to Missouri to run the municipals' state joint action agency, which is why I'm writing.? Part of our activity is operating a 19 city power pool (MoPEP) that has a three year supply contract of up to 40 mWh/hr with Enron.? We've had some difficulties with delivery since a change in tagging was made in June. ? The issue and a proposed solution is explained in the attached three page ""bullet statement"" that we've just submitted to the new NERC Security Subcommittee that meets tomorrow.? Based on his discussions with NERC staff, with a Mike Curry with Enron and other affected utilities, my chief operating officer for MoPEP is optimistic about prospects for this resolution.? I would like to make sure of Enron's support.? I'm told that Dick Ingersoll will be at the subcommittee meeting for Enron, and I know Dick from SPP meetings when I was on the Missouri Commission but don't have contact information on him now.? I'd be very grateful if you could pass along a nod of benign interest in this. We'd greatly appreciate Enron's support for the proposed resolution of the tagging issue at the NERC Subcommittee tomorrow, mainly because it should avoid what might otherwise be a messy contract dispute, at FERC or elsewhere, between our organizations.? Without getting into the details, my understanding of the issue under the energy purchase agreement has to do with whether the change in NERC tagging that was required on June 1 (the date when MoPEP started taking certain control area services from Western Resources) affects Enron's obligation under the agreement to deliver energy to the Associated Electric Cooperative transmission system.? MoPEP's view is that Enron's obligations are unaffected, but some at Enron apparently have had a different view.? Our belief is that the proposal that will be presented to the Security Subcommittee will resolve the tagging matter such that both Enron and MoPEP would regard any potential dispute on this issue as moot. Sorry for such short notice, but this resolution and taking it to the subcommittee came out of discussions in Atlanta Friday. Thanks for your consideration, Steve.? Hope all is well with you. Duncan Kincheloe General Manager and CEO Missouri Public Utility Alliance 573-445-3279 Fax 573-445-0680 - MoPEP Tagging.doc

Subject:: Re: pipeline aftermath
Body:: In case you had not heard, Lou Pai has done some fundraising for Franks and both he and his(Lou's) sister know him fairly well. Keep it in mind if at some point we need to get in to see him. From: Jeffrey Keeler 08/23/2000 03:44 PM To: Clayton Seigle/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron, Richard Shapiro/HOU/EES@EES, Michael Terraso/OTS/Enron@ENRON, David L Johnson/OTS/Enron@ENRON, Shelley Corman/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Joe Hillings/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Cynthia Sandherr/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Allison Navin/Corp/Enron@ENRON Subject: Re: pipeline aftermath Clayton: Here are some preliminary answers to your questions (and I have copied GPG and Government Affairs folks as well to share this information): 1) I am currently assessing the situation regarding pipeline safety legislation. This week has been very quiet on Capitol Hill as all of the members are back in the states on August recess running for re-election and it is a big vacation week for staff...but here's what I am hearing: As you may or may not know, we have been been very active this year trying to temper pipeline safety legislation that was fairly reactionary in the wake of last summer's liquid pipeline accident in Bellingham, WA. SENATE: In June, Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Slade Gorton (R-WA) led the charge to pass a pipeline safety bill (S. 2438) out of the Senate Commerce Committee, and that bill is awaiting floor action in the Senate. Because of the hasty way in which S. 2438 was drafted and passed, there was a realization by both Republicans and Democrats in the Senate that the bill could not make it to the floor for a vote until some serious changes were made -- mostly things that were deal breakers for industry. Enron and El Paso were leading the charge and we had a number of Senators backing our efforts to negotiate changes, including Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-MS), Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), John Breaux (D-LA), and Sam Brownback (R-KS). From what I've learned since the accident, these Senators are not changing their strategy and are still asking for the same improvements. Fortunately, most of the changes we were looking to make were fairly technical and not the types of things that would be seriously compromised by the accident. Industy was already in the position of having to accept a number of things they never would have if not for he Bellingham incident...the El Paso incident just reinforces those. The biggest potential effect I see from the El Paso accident is an increased effort to pass something before the Congress adjourns in early October. The New Mexico Senators are already calling for a floor vote on the McCain/Gorton legislation, and I there will certainly be greater pressure on leaders to wrap up negotiations, get agreement from all sides on a bill, and move it unanimously through a vote on the Senate floor. HOUSE: The House is moving a bit more slowly, but again, I'd expect the El Paso situation to expedite things somewhat. There were several bills introduced in the House that were not moving anywhere, including an identical copy of the McCain legislation introduced by Rep. Bob Franks (R-NJ). Franks is now anxious to move legislation, as he is running for Senate and would love to take credit for helping out on an issue of national visibility. Before the accident, House Tranportation Committee leaders on both the Democrat and Republican side were working on a ""consensus"" bill that they could introduce in early September and move quickly through the Committee and to the House floor. I'm told that negotiations on that legislation are moving forward and a draft bill will be produced shortly. Unlike our experience in the Senate, we have had significant input into the bill in advance, and expect something that we can live with -- and something more reasonable than the McCain bill. With that said, there may be an effort to expand the bill in a few areas because of the El Paso accident, so we'll have to see what kind of hand we're dealt in the next few weeks. Overall, I'd expect pipeline safety legislation to be given higher priority when Congress returns after Labor Day. In the absence of this accident, I would have given it slim odds of passing in the few short weeks until adjournment, with appropriations bills taking up most of Congress' precious time. Now there will be greater pressure to come to consensus and move bills through by an expedited process, so that everyone running for election in November can show that they've done something about this terrible tragedy. With that said, there's still not that much time to get legislation through, so I'd say that there's still a chance it may not get done this year. If I had to attach a number to it, I'd say that the El Paso accident improves the chances of legislation going all the way to probably 50-60%. 2) Gas supply to California: I'll have to do some more checking in this area and get back to you. All I've heard so far is that the safety questions that remain may slow the speed of restarting flow on the line, notwithstanding that El Paso thinks it can have things running again fairly quickly. I'm sure the power crunch in California will put some counter-pressure on, but I just don't have good intelligence on this yet. With all this said, I'm on vacation this week and parts of next week finishing up some leave I've taken for the birth of our new baby daughter, so I may not have an additional report for you until early to mid next week. If you have questions, please respond by e-mail, or leave a message on my voice mail at 202-466-9157.

Allison Clayton Seigle@ECT 08/22/2000 06:29 PM To: Cynthia Sandherr/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Subject: pipeline aftermath Hi Cynthia: The commercial officers here are very concerned with the El Paso pipeline explosion in New Mexico. We would love to get some input from your group on the following questions if possible: 1. What is the status of pipeline safety legislation on the Hill, and what is the outlook for action between now and the end of the year? 2. What are people from California saying about the added pressure on gas supplies, and what are people from New Mexico saying about restarting the flow of gas while safety questions remain? These questions come straight from the top, and any information you could provide would be very helpful. Please write me back or call and let me know if/when you think we might be able to get some initial answers. Thanks very much! Clay

However, the department, which has avoided PG&E Co.'s bankruptcy= =20 proceedings by claiming sovereign immunity, will not be controlled by the= =20 agreement. Montali pointed out that the department still could demand=20 reimbursement from PG&E.=20 Under the agreement, the ISO will not press any claims against PG&E on beha= lf=20 of generators if they are not paid.=20 The proposed preliminary injunction was based on an April order by the=20 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which forbade the ISO from purchasing= =20 power on behalf of any non-creditworthy buyer, such as PG&E.=20 The ISO is appealing the FERC order. If the appeal succeeds, the injunction= =20 will end.=20 Peter Schrag: Turning up the heat in Houston and Washington (Published June 6, 2001)=20 Behind all the palaver about the predictable standoff at last week's energy= =20 ""summit"" between President Bush and Gov. Gray Davis, one major political=20 development was missed.=20 Put simply, in the past month the focus of the California energy crisis, an= d=20 maybe the onus as well, has moved east: from the state's (and Davis')=20 handling of the mess to the generating companies, energy marketers and gas= =20 pipeline companies that have richly profited from it, and thus to FERC, the= =20 do-next-to-nothing Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and the Bush=20 administration.=20 That wasn't all Davis' doing -- far from it -- though it's been at the hear= t=20 of his message about energy industry ""pirates"" and ""profiteers."" Bush's=20 misbegotten energy plan and the administration's political clumsiness also= =20 contributed mightily, not least by inadvertently giving Davis the chance to= =20 get media exposure he could only have dreamed about.=20 More important, there's the defection of Sen. James Jeffords from the=20 Republican Party and the resulting shift of control in the U.S. Senate, whe= re=20 the next chair of the Energy Committee will be Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New=20 Mexico, a co-sponsor of Sen. Dianne Feinstein's bill capping wholesale=20 electric rates for the next two years. And chairing the Committee on=20 Governmental Affairs will be Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, who's=20 already asked for an audit of energy prices.=20 Those changes will draw a lot more attention to recent studies showing that= a=20 handful of big generators -- Duke Power, Reliant, Mirant, Dynegy and the hu= ge=20 energy-marketing firm Enron -- have gamed the market to drive wholesale=20 prices to levels that, in the year 2000, sometimes reached 40 times the=20 prices of the year before.=20 The findings come not merely from economists at the California Independent= =20 System Operator, the agency that manages the state's grid, who estimate=20 overcharges resulting from market power at $6.2 billion for last year alone= .=20 They come also from Severin Borenstein and his colleagues at the University= =20 of California Energy Institute, who ""conservatively"" calculate the=20 overcharges at $4.5 billion; from Paul Joskow, a widely respected energy=20 economist at MIT; and from Edward Kahn, an economic analyst in San Francisc= o.=20 In a recent paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research,=20 Joskow and Kahn conclude that there's ""considerable evidence that the high= =20 prices experienced in the summer of 2000 reflect the withholding of supplie= s=20 from the market by suppliers [generators or marketers] exercising market=20 power."" That those high prices occurred not merely during peak usage but al= so=20 at off-hours, when no one had ever seen a price spike before, makes those= =20 spikes even more curious.=20 There is, in addition, the powerful suspicion that the huge increase in=20 natural gas prices that a subsidiary of El Paso Energy Co., now the largest= =20 gas company on Earth, was charging on the California side of the=20 California-Arizona border wasn't merely the result of an innocent imbalance= =20 between supply and demand.=20 None of that may be illegal. If there's no collusion, there are no violatio= ns=20 of antitrust laws. But it adds plenty of steam to the political argument. I= n=20 the 2000 election cycle alone, energy companies kicked in some $64 million = in=20 political contributions, 75 percent of it to Republicans. At a time when=20 those companies, many of them located in the same Houston neighborhood, are= =20 racking up astronomical profits and when their collective coziness with Bus= h=20 and the Republican Party is a lot more than rhetoric, their vulnerability t= o=20 a vigorous Senate investigation ought to be obvious.=20 The clincher is ""Blackout,"" a ""Frontline"" program that both symbolizes the= =20 shifting emphasis and reinforces it. (The program is scheduled to be aired = at=20 8 p.m. Friday on Sacramento cable Channel 7.) It isn't another recital of= =20 Californians worrying about their electric bills, or about the stupidity of= =20 the state's deregulation scheme or how Davis dithered in addressing the=20 crisis. It is about those generators and marketers in Houston and North=20 Carolina, men (and a few women) who regard themselves as the heroes of the= =20 new energy markets.=20 The piece is reported by Lowell Bergman, who in working for both ""Frontline= ""=20 and the New York Times has already broken major print stories about Duke=20 Power's secret approach to Davis offering unspecified energy refunds in=20 return for an end to state investigations and lawsuits. Bergman also report= ed=20 private conversations between Enron chairman Kenneth Lay, a major Bush=20 supporter, and FERC chairman Curt Hebert regarding the influence that Lay= =20 could exercise with Bush to allow Hebert to keep his chairmanship if Hebert= 's=20 supported certain decisions Enron badly wants.=20 None of these recent events is likely to end Davis' political woes, and the= y=20 may not produce the wholesale rate caps Feinstein wants and that most=20 economists think necessary -- or maybe any significant reduction in the=20 industry's predatory pricing. But they will surely help turn up the heat,= =20 both in Houston and Washington.

Is trading an insider's game?=20 Buying, selling of electricity is a growth business, but some say deck is= =20 stacked against consumers By Craig D. Rose=20 UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER=20 June 6, 2001=20 While Californians decry deregulation's failure to deliver a competitive=20 market, electricity wholesalers have quietly developed a vast and rapidly= =20 growing business of buying and selling power among themselves.=20 The deals take place on high-tech trading floors in Houston and elsewhere= =20 around the country, as well as on Internet-based trading systems.=20 Some experts say this electricity trading is a key mechanism for raising=20 consumer power prices, yet it's largely unregulated.=20 ""Electricity trading is like buying stock -- when you have ability to chang= e=20 the stock price,"" said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economics profess= or=20 and member of the state grid operator's market surveillance group.=20 Energy companies say the buying and selling of contracts to deliver power= =20 provides risk management, allowing plant owners to presell their electricit= y,=20 lock in prices and avoid fluctuations. The rough and tumble of the free=20 market, they add, is the most efficient means of allocating a resource like= =20 electricity.=20 But industry critics say trading is far from a competitive market paradigm.= =20 In their view, it's a means of communication -- a way for energy insiders t= o=20 collude and raise prices under the guise of competition.=20 To be sure, the trading arms of major energy companies have emerged as star= s=20 in an industry where profit surges of 300 percent or 400 percent are not=20 uncommon.=20 The transactions, shrouded in secrecy, can leave ownership of a critical=20 commodity in unknown hands. Consider the case of power generated by AES=20 Corp.'s California plants.=20 In 1998, AES made a bold move. Immediately after purchasing power plants th= at=20 gave it control of 10 percent of the state's electric generating capacity,= =20 the company sold the output from its plants for the next 20 years to Willia= ms=20 Cos.=20 Williams did not sit on this treasure trove of electrons. The Tulsa, Okla.,= =20 company soon sold 80 percent of what it bought.=20 It is difficult to say who owns that power now. Some might be owned by Semp= ra=20 Trading, a sister company of SDG&E. Or some could be owned by Enron Corp.,= =20 the nation's biggest electricity trader.=20 A spokeswoman for Williams conceded that Williams itself may have repurchas= ed=20 some of the electricity it sold earlier. But trading companies closely guar= d=20 their positions.=20 This much can be said with certainty: Electricity that AES sold for less th= an=20 5 cents per kilowatt-hour to Williams changed hands perhaps 10 times in the= =20 wholesale market and emerged at times in recent months with a price tag for= =20 consumers that was 300 percent higher.=20 Williams' trading profits increased by 523 percent in the first quarter thi= s=20 year. Advance sales All this buying and selling creates curious confluences.=20 In their attempt to deflect criticism over high prices, generating companie= s=20 such as Duke Energy -- operator of the South Bay Power Plant in Chula and= =20 others in the state -- frequently note that they sell most of their=20 electricity far in advance. But they acknowledge less often that their=20 trading units may also be buying power, which could boost the company's=20 electricity inventory.=20 Duke was the fourth biggest electricity trader last year and cited its=20 trading activity as a prime contributor to its wholesale business profits,= =20 which soared 324 percent in the first quarter to $348 million.=20 It is a company's power traders who frequently direct plant operators to=20 increase or decrease the generation of power in response to market=20 conditions.=20 Energy companies have little option but to turn to trading for profits. One= =20 of the better kept secrets of electrical deregulation and its promise of=20 competition is that there is remarkably little competition in the productio= n=20 side of the business.=20 For one thing, electricity is a commodity; power from one company is=20 indistinguishable from that generated by others.=20 More important, nearly all modern plants generate power from turbines built= =20 by a handful of manufacturers. The result? Modern plants owned by different= =20 companies produce power at nearly identical cost.=20 ""The cost of power produced by modern plants is all within a mil=20 (one-thousandth of a dollar),"" said Michael Peevey, an adviser to Gov. Gray= =20 Davis and former president of Southern California Edison.=20 So the extraction of profit in the electricity business relies much more on= =20 trading. Traders' profits rise when prices are volatile -- plunging, or eve= n=20 better, rising sharply. Little regulation But despite the obvious temptation to manipulate the market, the burgeoning= =20 electricity trading business has remained largely unregulated.=20 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission does require quarterly filings fro= m=20 energy traders, but these often provide incomplete information, or at least= =20 little that has been of concern to FERC.=20 In fact, although the trading of electricity grew more than a hundredfold= =20 from 1996 to 2000, FERC has taken no major enforcement action against a=20 trader. After the onset of the California crisis last year, FERC has acted= =20 once. That was against Williams, which agreed to pay $8 million without=20 admitting guilt to resolve an allegation that it withheld supply to pump up= =20 prices.=20 FERC's record of enforcement in the area of power trading stands in contras= t=20 to a long list of enforcement actions within other markets taken by the=20 Securities Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission= .=20 FERC has recently added staff to its market oversight operations. But Willi= am=20 Massey, a FERC commissioner, says the agency's effort is still inadequate.= =20 ""Electricity can be flipped, stripped and chopped up,"" Massey said. ""It's a= n=20 extraordinarily complicated market.=20 ""The sophisticated marketers and traders have simply moved past us. We're= =20 kind of horse and buggy in our approach and they're out there in rocket shi= ps=20 flying around ... The problem is that sophisticated traders don't necessari= ly=20 produce reasonable prices. They produce profits.""=20 Before deregulation, electricity trading was a low-key affair. Regulated=20 utilities dealt power back and forth on a reciprocal basis to fill=20 electricity shortfalls in their control areas. There was little trading for= =20 profit until the mid-1990s, after federal legislation and FERC rulings open= ed=20 the market.=20 Major traders include large energy companies, sister companies of=20 California's major utilities and Wall Street firms. Market volatility In many ways, the trading of power is similar to that of other commodities.= =20 But there are important differences. Because it cannot be stored and its us= e=20 is so fundamental, the price of electricity is the most volatile of all.=20 When supplies are tight, a single supplier can rapidly raise prices to=20 budget-busting levels, as evidenced by Duke Energy's recent admission that = it=20 charged California nearly $4,000 for a megawatt-hour of power, a quantity= =20 that probably sold hours earlier for one-tenth of that sum or less.=20 Wolak, the Stanford economist, and state Sen. Joseph Dunn, D-Garden Grove,= =20 who is investigating the state power market, say trading allows companies t= o=20 collude under the guise of competition. Instead of wringing out lowest cost= s,=20 the wholesale trading market serves to raise prices, they say.=20 ""As I trade to you and you trade to me, we communicate to each other what= =20 price we would like to get,"" said Wolak. ""It's not collusive. It's just=20 communicating price.""=20 Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron, the nation's biggest power trader, said= =20 California's problem is not the result of trading.=20 ""It's a result of shortages,"" Palmer said.=20 Underscoring its emphasis on trading, Enron's new headquarters tower in=20 downtown Houston rises from a six-story block of new trading floors,=20 including expanded space for electricity trading.=20 Enron also pioneered trading in cyberspace and its Enron Online site claims= =20 to be the most active computer-based trading market.=20 The Houston company argues that consumers won't fully benefit from power=20 trading and deregulation until they have greater choice in choosing their= =20 power supplier. And the company says FERC has not done enough to open acces= s=20 to transmission lines, which would allow traders to move power around the= =20 country. To that end, Enron has lobbied hard for President Bush's plan for = a=20 national electricity grid.=20 Palmer says the notion that the price of electricity rises each time it is= =20 traded is mistaken.=20 ""The market is always looking for the real price of a commodity,"" Palmer=20 said.=20 Dunn, the California state senator, says his investigation found a differen= t=20 function for trading. At a time when supply barely meets or falls short of= =20 demand, he noted, companies with electricity to sell have to worry only abo= ut=20 how high to set their price.=20 ""The trader is a pawn in the generator's game to drive up prices,"" said Dun= n.=20 ""Trading develops a level of trust. You, my alleged competitor, will bid in= =20 the same patterns and I will respond not in a competitive pattern but in a= =20 complimentary pattern.""=20 The state senator said his investigation found evidence that on several day= s,=20 energy companies appeared to test their ability to drive prices up, without= =20 being undercut by competitors.=20 This ability to drive up prices without competitive consequence is a key te= st=20 of market power, the technical term for manipulation or price fixing.=20 But Dunn also conceded that antitrust violations can be hard to prove in=20 court. He suggested that even if the trading behavior falls short of=20 antitrust violations, it remains anti-competitive and devastating for the= =20 California economy.=20 To Harry Trebing, a utility industry expert and professor emeritus at=20 Michigan State University, wholesale electricity trading is reminiscent of= =20 what took place in the 1920s and early '30s. Back then, utility companies= =20 created complex networks of holding companies that traded stock among=20 themselves, driving up prices in the process.=20 Undoing that scheme was a focus of President Franklin Roosevelt's=20 administration. Congress ended up barring national power companies and=20 tightening regulation of utilities, in an effort to counteract their tenden= cy=20 to create markets that work only for insiders.=20 ""The broad goals of trading are the same,"" Trebing said.=20 ""The goal is to maximize profits through raising prices.""=20 Daily energy costs for state fall in past weeks=20 By Ed Mendel=20 UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER=20 June 6, 2001=20 SACRAMENTO -- In some of the first good news of the electricity crisis, the= =20 Davis administration said yesterday that the daily cost of power purchased = by=20 the state for utility customers has dropped in recent weeks.=20 The price-drop news comes after an announcement that Californians conserved= =20 more energy than expected last month, 11 percent, and amid Davis=20 administration optimism that the Legislature may finally begin to move on a= =20 plan to keep Southern California Edison out of bankruptcy.=20 The developments, if they turn out to be a trend and not temporary, could b= e=20 among the first signs that Gov.

What do you think about having Nels make the call to Lundquist just to find out what his status is, what he might look for when his current assignment is over, etc. (obviously without identifying us -- presumably Nels would have reason to talk to him anyway in the normal course of business)? I am not wedded to the idea but am inclined toward at least getting the information, unless you see a problem. Linda Robertson 03/13/2001 02:16 PM To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron, Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: Andrew Lundquist I got your message about Andrew. He would be an excellent catch. However, I see a couple of significant problems. My guess is that Andrew is too senior for this position, particularly after having chaired the Cheney task force. Also, I would not anticipate that he would be available for several months, if then. We should fill this position immediately. We are already missing opportunities because this position is vacant. As for our search, using Korn Ferry, I have narrowed the field to two very good candidates. I am setting up time for Rick to interview these candidates next Monday. The first candidate is Drew Maloney with Rep. Tom Delay's office. Drew would give us enormous visibility in House Republican leadership circles, seems trustworthy, and capable of learning most of the substance of the energy portfolio. Drew has strong networking skills, which I think would nicely fit with Tom's strategic and technical skills. The second candidate is John Shelk, whom I have known for nearly 15 years. John was the lead Republican staff on the House Energy and Commerce Committee under Norm Lent. John left the Committee in 1992. Since then John has worked in the financial services and gaming industries, where he has enhanced his political and Republican networking skills. John in very short order would have extremely strong technical skills, atlhough he has been away from the industry for eight years. I believe both candidates bring different but very strong talents to the job. I have a second opening for an enviromental advocate. I am discussing with Rick the possibility of whether we could redirect one of these candidates (probably John) to that slot. That said, please let me know if I should have Nels pursue Andrew.

Joseph Lieberman, the former Democratic vice presidential nominee= ,=20 heads the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee that quizzed the FERC=20 commissioners and Davis on efforts to stabilize the chaotic Western=20 electricity market. ?????Davis accused FERC of failing to act aggressively against alleged=20 price-gouging by out-of-state generators. ?????""To date, not a single penny in refunds has been returned to=20 Californians,"" Davis said. ""It is unconscionable for the generators to prof= it=20 from their egregious overcharges. FERC must move quickly to enforce the law= =20 and order the energy companies to give back the money."" ?????Davis said the state is owed refunds of at least $6.7 billion.=20 California's grid operator has estimated that from May 2000 to May 2001,=20 power generators charged the state nearly $9 billion more than a competitiv= e=20 market would warrant, he said. ?????California, the nation's most populous state, has been hit with a seri= es=20 of rolling blackouts, the bankruptcy of its largest utility, and an economi= c=20 slowdown since the power crisis began last year. ?????The state is expected to convene a criminal grand jury to investigate= =20 whether some power generators withheld supplies, shut down plants or=20 exploited the bidding process to drive up prices. Out-of-state generators= =20 deny any illegal activity, saying the high prices simply reflect supply=20 shortages. ?????Today also marks the day that FERC's newly expanded ""price mitigation""= =20 program goes into effect in all 11 Western states with a wholesale price=20 limit of $107.9 per megawatt hour linked to a market formula. The plan had= =20 previously applied only to California during emergency power outages. ?????Since FERC's action earlier this week, Senate Democrats dropped a=20 legislative effort to strictly cap electricity prices in the West. However,= =20 California Democrats in the House were still trying to force a full vote on= a=20 package of energy amendments, including a price cap. ?????The Bush administration and many Republicans oppose price caps,=20 contending they would discourage more power production. ?????Separately, today the U.S. Energy Department issued a study that=20 supported the White House's view that strict price caps would hurt, not hel= p,=20 California. ?????The study found California faces about 113 hours of rolling blackouts= =20 this summer, a level that would double if wholesale prices were capped at= =20 $150 per megawatt because some 3,600 megawatts of generating capacity would= =20 shut down. An alternative approach of setting a price cap based on producti= on=20 costs plus $25 per megawatt would delay or close about 1,300 megawatts of= =20 capacity scheduled to be built in the state, according to the study. ?????However, lawmakers from both political parties have scrambled for some= =20 kind of solution to address the shortages in California well before the=20 congressional elections next year. ?????The FERC plan expands an existing ""price mitigation"" program in=20 California to 10 other Western states. The plan, which runs through Septemb= er=20 2002, means that during nonemergency periods the price for wholesale power= =20 cannot exceed 85 percent of the cost of electricity sold during a Stage 1= =20 power shortage emergency in California. ?????A Stage 1 emergency is declared when electricity supplies fall below 7= =20 percent of demand on the Western power grid. ?????The plan also imposes a 10 percent surcharge on all power sales into= =20 California as financial protection for generators reluctant to sell to the= =20 state's financially weak utilities. ?????Davis was due to meet the two newest FERC commissioners, Patrick Wood = of=20 Texas and Nora Brownell of Pennsylvania, today.

In return,=20 Republicans are trying to shift the focus back toward Davis--most=20 aggressively through a California-wide television advertising campaign=20 organized by Scott Reed, a former executive director of the Republican=20 National Committee. ?????""Our goal is to get the focus back to Sacramento, where it belongs,""= =20 Reed said. ?????Both sides see the same prize in this tug of war: the opportunity to= =20 determine where most Californians direct their anger during what could be a= =20 long, hot summer of power shortages. ?????""The situation is that the public's minds are not made up on this=20 issue--whether it is Sacramento or Washington who has acted too little, too= =20 late,"" said Mark Baldassare, a pollster at the independent Public Policy=20 Institute of California. ""That gives both sides an opportunity to get their= =20 messages out. The stakes are fairly high in terms of how the public in=20 California ends up assessing blame over the next few months."" ?????A Slight Uptick in Davis' Popularity ?????Overall, Davis' political situation appears to be stabilizing. After= =20 months of runaway power costs, the prices the state pays for wholesale=20 electricity are falling and new plants will come online next month. And=20 following a free fall in private polls, Davis has seen his numbers tick bac= k=20 up slightly. Similarly, a poll financed by independent power generators=20 showed that in mid-June, for the first time in months, Californians were=20 becoming slightly more confident that the crisis is easing. ?????Within the state Capitol, Davis is asserting himself, demanding that= =20 lawmakers hold hearings on his rescue plan for Southern California Edison. = On=20 Monday, he released details of a similar plan for San Diego Gas & Electric.= =20 Last week, he announced an agreement that is likely to increase generation = by=20 alternative energy producers, who account for about a fourth of the state's= =20 supply. ?????""This guy is changing,"" said state Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon), who = a=20 few months back had been urging that Davis take a more aggressive stance on= =20 the crisis. ""There is a difference in his demeanor and focus."" ?????Yet the energy crisis still looms as a vast cloud over a reelection=20 campaign that once looked like a stroll on the beach. ?????The paradox for Davis is that the substantive victory for pricecontrol= =20 advocates at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission meeting this week may= =20 complicate his political goal of maintaining a heavy focus on Washington.= =20 Though Davis and some congressional Democrats portrayed FERC's decision as= =20 insufficient, it appears to have lanced the pressure for federal legislatio= n=20 to impose the tighter price controls that Davis supports.=20 ?????Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), a principal sponsor of that bill, on= =20 Tuesday announced she would shelve the measure for six months to give the n= ew=20 FERC plan time to work. ?????As a result, the political effect of the FERC ruling could be to shift= =20 the focus away from Washington back toward decisions in Sacramento, which i= s=20 exactly what Republicans prefer. ""Gray Davis is the dog that finally caught= =20 the car,"" said Dan Schnur, a San Francisco-based GOP consultant. ""Davis is= =20 going to keep screaming about price caps and refunds, but now Republicans c= an=20 point to substantive action."" ?????Davis: 'Much More They Should Do' ?????For months, Davis has criticized Bush for refusing to support=20 electricity price controls and other measures that the governor says could= =20 ease California's energy crunch. At almost every opportunity, Davis offers= =20 the same message: California is taking the steps it needs to, but Washingto= n=20 has failed to help enough. That was precisely Davis' message Monday when FE= RC=20 significantly expanded the limited price caps it had imposed previously. ?????While saying that FERC had ""finally taken a step in the right=20 direction,"" Davis added: ""There is much more they should do""--including=20 providing refunds to California for alleged overcharges. The overall tone o= f=20 Davis' statement was much more skeptical about FERC's action than the remar= ks=20 from Feinstein, who described the decision as ""a giant step forward."" ?????Aides say Davis plans to repeat that two-part message in his appearanc= e=20 today before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, chaired by Sen.=20 Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.). In his testimony, and in a round of schedule= d=20 television appearances, Davis will demand that FERC order refunds in the=20 range of $5 billion to $6 billion to the state, aides said. Davis also will= =20 distribute to every member of Congress a 177-page book chronicling the=20 state's response to the crisis. ?????Inside the Bush White House, some officials see in Davis' cool respons= e=20 to FERC's decision more evidence that the governor is determined to use the= =20 White House as a foil in his reelection campaign. The prevailing view, one= =20 official said, is that, no matter what concessions the administration offer= s,=20 Davis will immediately raise the bar and demand something else--the way he= =20 did by talking about rebates as soon as FERC offered tougher price controls= . ?????""That is Davis' M.O.,"" said one official involved in the White House's= =20 energy strategy. ""He asks the administration to do something, the=20 administration does it, and then he attacks the administration for not doin= g=20 enough. . . . He needs someone to blame."" ?????Davis aides reject that characterization, arguing that the governor is= =20 merely representing the state's interests against an administration that th= ey=20 maintain is favoring energy producers over consumers. But Davis advisors=20 acknowledge that they have used focus groups to test campaign messages that= =20 pin the blame for the energy crunch primarily on Davis' Republican=20 predecessor, Pete Wilson, and a ""Republican president who has failed to sto= p=20 his rich friends in the energy industry"" from gouging consumers, one aide= =20 said. ?????""You don't have to tell people in focus groups more than once how this= =20 is connected,"" the Davis aide said. ?????Gubernatorial Rivals Are Free of Blame ?????Baldassare, the independent pollster, notes it may be especially=20 imperative for Davis to keep Bush's energy decisions in the spotlight becau= se=20 none of his potential Republican opponents in 2002--California Secretary of= =20 State Bill Jones, former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan or businessman= =20 William E. Simon Jr.--is easily tagged with complicity in the problem. ""Non= e=20 of them were really involved in the decision-making over deregulation,""=20 Baldassare said. ""The only one else to blame, in a political sense, is=20 Washington and the Bush administration."" ?????The new independent advertising campaign against Davis was inspired=20 largely by the fear of that strategy succeeding--damaging the standing in= =20 California not only of Bush but also of other Republicans, particularly tho= se=20 in Congress. Reed, whose American Taxpayers Alliance is funding the ads, sa= id=20 he decided to launch the campaign after Davis appeared to gain the upper ha= nd=20 in the media debate following Bush's visit to California late last month. ?????""The Bush trip really changed the terms of debate about Davis' problem= =20 and made it more of a possible national Republican problem,"" Reed said. ""Th= e=20 entire terms of debate turned around and was focused on the issue of price= =20 caps as opposed to negligence on Davis' behalf. Our group is attempting to = go=20 out and engage Davis."" ?????To ""engage"" Davis, Reed's group, which has not revealed its donors, is= =20 spending what he said would be $1.5 million on an initial ad criticizing=20 Davis this week, though a spot check of TV stations around the state=20 indicated a far more modest buy. Reed said the group is planning to air a n= ew=20 ad as soon as this week. ?????Democrats plan to answer the ads with attacks of their own and will be= =20 filing complaints with the IRS and other federal agencies about the anonymo= us=20 funding of the Reed ad. ?????Today's Senate hearing will give Davis another chance to respond to th= e=20 GOP and make his case for greater help from Washington. But Lieberman aides= =20 acknowledge the hearing is likely to be much less confrontational than it= =20 would have been if FERC had not acted Monday.

Copyright 2001 Los Angeles Times=20 Blackout Forecasts' Dark Side=20 If optimists are wrong and the power runs out, California's energy crisis= =20 could quickly cost lives and cripple the economy.=20 By JENIFER WARREN, Times Staff Writer=20 ?????It's here. Summer 2001, the blackout season, is only a day away. ?????Already Californians anticipate power outages when temperatures rise. = By=20 August, the occasional annoyances endured so far--stoplights gone dark,=20 computers, air conditioners and elevators idled--could seem almost quaint. ?????Gov. Gray Davis insists we needn't worry. Four large new power plants= =20 are firing up soon, he said, and government's best and brightest are lockin= g=20 up still more megawatts to help meet our peak summer need. Californians,=20 Davis predicts, will valiantly heed his call to conserve, helping the state= =20 survive the hot months, no sweat. ?????With luck, he'll be right. Power prices have stabilized, and some ener= gy=20 analysts are wondering whether California may have tamed the blackout beast= . ?????But what if those plants don't get built in time, people don't trim=20 their electricity use 7% and energy imports are more meager than expected? ?????And what if the state gets hit by a summer that is not moderately hot,= =20 as Davis bets, but blistering, record-setting hot? ?????Government experts who ponder such questions don't expect disaster in= =20 the coming months. But they are planning for it nonetheless. ?????At best, they say, Californians can expect some gridlocked=20 intersections, an occasionally overloaded 911 system, perhaps some business= =20 bankruptcies, certainly inconvenience. At worst, the Western power grid cou= ld=20 crash, causing uncontrolled blackouts that might lead to looting,=20 contaminated water supplies, even civil unrest. ?????""How bad could this summer get?"" said state Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana= ).=20 ""This summer could be the worst disaster to ever hit the state of Californi= a."" ?????Imagine it's a Thursday morning in the third week of July. Relentless= =20 heat grips California, the curse of a stubborn high-pressure ridge that jus= t=20 won't budge. ?????As air conditioners from Redding to Chula Vista lumber to life, manage= rs=20 of the state's power grid in Folsom gulp their third and fourth cups of=20 coffee, stare at a bank of computers and begin to fret. ?????Demand is jumping. Supply is static, Canada and Arizona have nothing t= o=20 sell. It's looking tight. ?????Thirty minutes later, the picture is gloomier. A brush fire shuts down= =20 transmission lines near Fresno, squeezing supply in the Central Valley. In= =20 the Bay Area, the unusual heat drives demand well past projections. ?????By noon things look bleak. Operators of the Diablo Canyon nuclear powe= r=20 plant near San Luis Obispo have cut output by 80%. The trouble? Chunks of= =20 kelp have lodged in one of the plant's seawater intake valves, creating a= =20 clog like one that plagued the facility in January. ?????With a chorus of groans, the grid's keepers scour the market for power= =20 to offset the Diablo loss. No luck. As the mercury climbs and the Golden=20 State economy roars into full swing, electricity consumption ticks upward,= =20 minute by minute. And when managers of a power plant near Long Beach cut=20 output because of a cracked turbine, everyone knows what it means. ?????Alert the utilities. It's lights out, California, for the fourth day i= n=20 a row. ?????Dr. J. Michael Leary dreads blackouts--not personally, but=20 professionally. Leary is an emergency room physician in the desert city of= =20 Rancho Mirage. When air conditioners go on the blink there, the=20 victims--scores of them, mostly old folks--wind up in his ER. ?????In a normal year, 75% of his emergency patients are geriatrics. Like= =20 infants, the elderly are unusually vulnerable to the heat. When blackouts= =20 hit, they are most at risk. ?????""It's as if you lived in Maine and they turned the heat off in January= ,""=20 Leary said. ""This is an extreme environment we live in. The effects can be= =20 devastating."" ?????Many desert seniors are on fixed incomes and live in mobile homes, som= e=20 of them poorly insulated boxes that turn into ovens under the brutal summer= =20 sun. Take away the air conditioning and the humans inside start baking, qui= ck. ?????For Leary, the specter of continual, back-to-back blackouts in=20 July--and, some predict, in June and August too--conjures images of an=20 82-year-old man, living alone in one of those mobile homes, taking medicati= on=20 for heart disease. The cardiovascular drugs plague the man with numerous si= de=20 effects; one inhibits his body's ability to cool itself. ?????When a person gets overheated, body temperature eventually rises=20 uncontrollably. Then comes a nasty spiral of effects, and pretty soon ""you = go=20 into shock,"" Leary said. ""Everything just shuts down."" ?????On average each year, 371 Americans die from heat-related causes, more= =20 than the number killed by earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, lightning and= =20 floods combined. In 1995, a record hot spell in Chicago killed 465 people.= =20 Eleven Californians died from the heat in 1998. ?????A new report by the United Seniors Assn. predicts that more than half = a=20 million elderly Californians could need hospitalization for heat-related=20 ailments this summer.=20 ?????Some communities have laid plans for cooling shelters, wading pools an= d=20 other measures to provide relief. But will all who need help get it? Or get= =20 it in time? ?????Out in the desert, paramedics expect a crush of 911 calls when the pow= er=20 goes out and the ill, frail and frightened seek help. Leary and others at= =20 Eisenhower Medical Center will be waiting, armed with ice packs, cooled IVs= =20 and ventilators. ?????""I am very, very worried,"" the doctor said. ""I think we'll see a great= =20 toll in human suffering, even mortality."" ?????California's tomato processors are no less anxious. They wash, cook,= =20 peel, chop, mash and can about 1 million tons of tomatoes a week from July = to=20 October--enough to account for half the world's supply. For them, a string = of=20 unexpected power losses could mean economic ruin in a matter of days. ?????The reason lies in the peculiar nature of food processing--a sterile= =20 system instantly contaminated if the power fails and the plant's precise=20 temperature is disturbed. ?????Once a batch of tomatoes is tainted, it must be thrown out--all 50,000= =20 pounds. The plant must then be sanitized, a painstaking process that takes= =20 about 36 hours. ?????""If you get hit by blackouts every third day for, say, two weeks, you'= re=20 starting, stopping, cleaning, restarting--it's a nightmare,"" said Jeff Boes= e,=20 president of the California League of Food Processors. ""You could lose thre= e=20 batches and be out $40 million before you knew what hit you."" ?????Meanwhile, farmers with still more truckloads of tomatoes line up=20 outside the plant, waiting to be paid for their crop: ""If we can't process= =20 them, the farmers have spent an entire season growing them for nothing,""=20 Boese said. ?????In Sonoma County, the object in peril is the chicken. Egg producers=20 equip their laying houses with fans and swamp coolers to keep the hens=20 comfortable. Power is also needed to run giant refrigerators filled with eg= gs. ?????""In a blackout, those hens can overheat in no time,"" said Rich Matteis= =20 of the Pacific Egg and Poultry Assn. ""In 20 or 30 minutes, you could have= =20 100,000 birds die."" ?????Many large producers have backup generators, but they are not designed= =20 for ongoing, intensive use. Will they hold up? Small-scale egg producers=20 often have no backup power at all. ?????Hundreds of other California businesses could suffer if summer shapes = up=20 as bad as some predict. ?????The Valero Refining Co. of California, northeast of San Francisco,=20 produces 115,000 barrels of gasoline a day. Because restarting a refinery i= s=20 a complicated task, two or three blackouts close together could prompt=20 officials to shutter it until electricity supplies stabilize--costing=20 California about 10% of its gasoline supply. ?????At a Berkeley medical laboratory, doctors say power losses to their=20 freezers could destroy bone marrow needed to give young leukemia patients= =20 lifesaving transplants. The state's 400 dialysis centers, where patients=20 without kidney function go to have their blood cleansed every other day, ar= e=20 in the same fix. Few have backup generators, so when an outage hits,=20 technicians must crank the machines by hand. ?????Most Californians, of course, face far more ordinary consequences. The= =20 scoreboards will fizzle at summer softball games, joggers on treadmills wil= l=20 be stopped in their tracks, electric organs will go silent, leaving choirs = to=20 sing without accompaniment. ?????Parents will be asked to retrieve children from day-care centers when= =20 the lights and cooling systems conk out. Anniversary lunches may be ruined= =20 when restaurants cannot grill salmon or blend margaritas. ?????Most people will tolerate occasional disturbances, psychologists say,= =20 doing their part in a time of crisis. But what if such irritations become a= n=20 everyday fact of life? ?????Hundreds of ""essential"" energy users--including prisons, fire=20 departments and airports--are protected from blackouts, and hundreds more= =20 have applied for exemptions. That means the pool of people bearing the=20 blackout burden is shrinking, so more frequent outages are likely. ?????Blackout predictions vary widely, but at least one forecaster, a=20 consultant for California water districts, anticipates an outage almost eve= ry=20 afternoon of every workday this summer if temperatures are unusually warm. ?????Californians are accustomed to trash compactors, giant-screen TVs and= =20 having the Internet at their fingertips. How much deprivation will they=20 tolerate? ?????""So far, the version of blackouts we've experienced hasn't looked too= =20 scary to people--it happens on a workday, in the afternoon, and you basical= ly=20 have to come home and reset your VCR,"" said Dan Kammen, a professor of ener= gy=20 and society at UC Berkeley. ?????But if outages become daily events, and start to invade the evening=20 hours, the public mood could change abruptly. ?????""When there's a disaster or crisis or trauma, people tend to act=20 heroically and work together,"" said Robert Butterworth, a Los Angeles=20 psychologist and trauma specialist. ""But the civilized behavior only lasts = a=20 short period. Then people start acting in unpredictable ways."" ?????That tendency may be exacerbated, Butterworth said, by the nature of t= he=20 energy crisis--not a natural disaster, but a man-made one. ?????""People start to look for a scapegoat,"" he said. ""People will look for= a=20 target, and there's a tendency to strike out at whoever is closest to you."" ?????One place that tendency may surface, Butterworth said, is on=20 traffic-clogged roads. Blackouts already have led to scores of accidents. A= dd=20 summer heat to the mix, and repeat the pattern day after day at rush hour,= =20 and motorists' patience could wear thin, law enforcement officials say. ?????""We're bracing for . . . possible acts of violence and road rage,"" sai= d=20 Sacramento County Sheriff's Lt. Larry Saunders. ?????Lon House is the water consultant who predicts California could see=20 blackouts almost every summer weekday. Among the worries for the 440 water= =20 agencies he represents: losing the ability to pump water during wildfire=20 season. ?????""I'm telling them to be ready for a major earthquake every day this=20 summer--meaning all your power is out throughout your district for multiple= =20 hours,"" House said. ?????House insists he isn't an alarmist. But on top of the fire fears, he= =20 warns that blackouts of more than a few hours would allow air into water=20 pipes, contaminating supplies. If that happens, Californians would be urged= =20 to boil their water until the system can be disinfected from one end of the= =20 pipe to the other. ?????Though rolling blackouts are risky, they remain essentially a controll= ed=20 phenomenon, occurring when and where the grid managers and utilities decide= .=20 Far more frightening--and devastating--are unexpected, cascading outages th= at=20 could shut down the entire Western power grid. It happened in August 1996,= =20 leaving 4 million people without power during a triple-digit heat wave. ?????The problem began when power lines in Oregon sagged into trees and shu= t=20 themselves off. That triggered a chain reaction of automatic switch-offs an= d=20 oscillating surges of energy that ultimately shut down all four of the main= =20 power arteries between California and the Pacific Northwest. ?????That robbed the system of thousands of megawatts--enough to power the= =20 city of Seattle four times over--and scattered outages across California an= d=20 six other Western states. Thousands of customers were without power for mor= e=20 than a day. ?????Though such an episode is rare, California grid managers say it is mor= e=20 likely today because the system is taxed by the ever-increasing load of=20 electricity it bears. ?????""The system is very dynamic, and when it's heavily loaded and highly= =20 stressed, like it is now, the smallest little thing could cause big trouble= ,""=20 said Kevin Bakker, who oversees California's connection to the greater=20 Western power grid.=20 ?????If a massive, uncontrolled outage should hit, the ramifications could = be=20 dizzying, said Mike Guerin, chief of law enforcement for the state Office o= f=20 Emergency Services.

Gray Davis. ?????As early as next week, the order will stop the hemorrhaging of the sta= te=20 budget by allowing Treasurer Phil Angelides to borrow $5 billion to buy=20 electricity. That money is expected to cover power purchases until this fal= l,=20 when the state plans to sell an unprecedented $12.5 billion in bonds to rep= ay=20 the general tax fund and buy future electricity. ?????Angelides said Tuesday that he has already lined up $3.5 billion in=20 loans from two Wall Street firms, and expects to secure at least another=20 billion by next week, when he plans to close the deal and obtain the money. ?????The loan is critical, he said, because without it, electricity purchas= es=20 would completely deplete state coffers as early as October. ?????""In essence, it stops the general-fund bleeding,"" Angelides said. ""Wha= t=20 this interim financing does is take the pressure off the general fund and,= =20 hopefully, avert a cash crisis."" ?????The loan could also ease concerns on Wall Street that California's ris= ky=20 entry into the power business has placed the state budget in a precarious= =20 position. Those concerns were one of the main reasons two major credit rati= ng=20 agencies downgraded the state earlier this year. ?????""We have been looking forward to this day,"" said Ray Murphy, a vice=20 president at Moody's Investors Service, one of the two firms that downgrade= d=20 California's credit rating.

Rather, it permits Angelides to use the loan proceeds to assist t= he=20 Department of Water Resources, the state agency buying power, with its futu= re=20 electricity expenses. ?????If the bond issue is further delayed, Angelides estimated, the loan=20 would gives California another four to six months before it would begin to= =20 run out of money. Furthermore, the loan closes a potential loophole that=20 existed in the long-term contracts Davis had signed to stabilize the cost o= f=20 electricity, which would have let power suppliers walk away from the deals = if=20 the state had not secured a source of financing by next month. ?????But Republicans warned that by entering into a bridge loan deal withou= t=20 knowing when the bonds would be sold, Davis and the Democrats were incurrin= g=20 major risks that could further drive up the price tag of the crisis. ?????The loan carries a blended interest rate of about 4.5%, but if it is n= ot=20 repaid by Oct. 31, the rate jumps to 7%.

As wonderful as that sounds, the FERC order still allows wholesale= =20 generators to extract enough windfall profits to drive the region into=20 recession.=20 ?????The FERC's approach may also perversely lead to more air pollution and= =20 natural gas shortages.=20 ?????Let's look at what the FERC did right. First, the order approved Monda= y=20 establishes price caps on a 24/7 basis rather than simply during power=20 emergencies--a long overdue reform.=20 ?????Second, the order protects the entire West, not just California. This= =20 regional cap will end ""megawatt laundering,"" whereby in-state generators so= ld=20 power across California lines and then resold it back into the state to eva= de=20 caps.=20 ?????Third, the order closes the ridiculous broker loophole that made the= =20 FERC's previous price caps Swiss cheese. Before, generators could redirect= =20 their sales from the market to energy brokers who were exempt from the pric= e=20 caps.=20 ?????So where did the FERC go wrong? The problem may be traced to the two= =20 competing methods of imposing price caps and the all-important concept of= =20 ""economic rent.""=20 ?????Economic rent, in the wholesale electricity market, is the market pric= e=20 of electricity minus the producer's cost, where cost includes not just labo= r=20 and fuel but a ""fair profit"" on the invested capital as well. In traditiona= l=20 regulation, this fair profit is calculated very simply as the market cost o= f=20 the money borrowed to build the power plant.=20 ?????Under this definition, if the producer's cost is a nickel a kilowatt= =20 hour and he can sell it for 35 cents--as producers in the West have been=20 doing--the producer can extract 30 cents of economic rent from consumers.= =20 ?????In California, the extraction of such economic rent through market=20 manipulation has taken place on a grand-theft scale. In 1999, California's= =20 electricity bill was about $7 billion. Last year, it was almost $30 billion= =20 for roughly the same amount of electricity. This year, California's bill is= =20 well on its way to $50 billion annually.=20 ?????To stop this rip-off, Gov. Gray Davis proposed ""cost-based"" price caps= .=20 Such caps are calculated on a plant-specific basis. Each generator is allow= ed=20 to recover its cost of production, including the fair profit, but not a pen= ny=20 more.=20 ?????Thus, for example, a newer, highly efficient plant generating power at= a=20 nickel per kilowatt hour would collect a nickel. The oldest, least efficien= t=20 plant that generated power for 20 cents would be allowed to collect 20 cent= s.=20 ?????By setting different prices for different plants, the economic rents a= re=20 driven to zero. Yet each generator still has a fair profit incentive to=20 produce. From a public policy perspective, it's the best of all possible=20 worlds. And it was categorically rejected by the FERC. Instead, the FERC se= ts=20 a single price for all generators based on the cost of the ""least efficient= =20 plant.""=20 ?????The obvious problem with this umbrella pricing rule is that it still= =20 allows generators to extract billions in economic rent from consumers.=20 ?????In our previous example, and under the FERC's rule, the least efficien= t=20 plant still collects 20 cents a unit to recover costs. However, the most=20 efficient plant producing power at a nickel-per-kilowatt also collects 20= =20 cents rather than a nickel and thus extracts a full 15 cents of economic=20 rent.=20 ?????Thus, under the FERC's rule, wholesale generators still will be able t= o=20 capture tens of billions of dollars more from consumers and businesses than= =20 under Davis' cost-based rule.=20 ?????The FERC's approach is still subject to the same kind of strategic=20 gaming that has been the hallmark of this crisis. Generators will ensure th= at=20 during peak times, when the price cap is being established, the most=20 expensive possible plant is in operation--whether it needs to be or not. Th= is=20 will peg the price at the highest level.=20 ?????In addition, the FERC provides generators with a perverse incentive to= =20 run their least efficient units more often. Since these least efficient=20 plants are also the highest polluting, the result will be dirtier air.=20 Moreover, the excessive running of these plants may also put a strain on=20 already stretched natural gas supplies.

California is the dog.""=20 To understand why the Northwest is now facing its own energy crisis and how= =20 the energy problems in the Northwest and California each affect each other,= =20 one must understand how the Northwest gets its power.=20 In the Northwest, falling water is our primary fuel. Depending on the=20 available snowpack, hydroelectricity produced at more than 200 dams in the= =20 Columbia River basin generates between 60 and 75 percent of the region's=20 electricity. About two-thirds of this hydropower comes from 29 dams owned a= nd=20 operated by the two federal agencies, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and= =20 the Bureau of Reclamation.=20 By taking advantage of the region's geography and climate, the Columbia's= =20 hydroelectric dams have produced some of the least expensive electricity in= =20 the nation, power that has been the economic backbone of the region.=20 However, the Columbia's hydrosystem also has two curses.=20 One is that water conditions can vary greatly, and right now the Northwest= =20 and California are in the middle of an extreme drought. The second is the= =20 dams' negative impact on salmon. These dams operate under a federal salmon= =20 recovery plan established under the Endangered Species Act that calls for= =20 more water to be sent over spillways to help push the salmon downstream=20 instead of through the dams' power-generating turbines.=20 That power is sold at cost and transmitted to Northwest consumer-owned=20 utilities by yet another federal agency called the Bonneville Power=20 Administration. These ""cost-based"" rates cover the expense of repaying the= =20 U.S.=20 Treasury for the cost of developing these hydropower projects, moving the= =20 power over massive transmission lines, and supporting efforts to restore th= e=20 dwindling salmon runs.=20 Under federal law, Northwest consumers get preferred access to the relative= ly=20 low-cost power. Any surplus power can be sold, most often to California's= =20 municipal and investor-owned utilities.=20 This Northwest ""regional preference"" to federal power was part of the deal= =20 that led to the construction of the massive transmission lines, called ""the= =20 intertie,"" which first connected the Northwest with California and the=20 Southwest in the late 1960s.=20 For decades, the intertie worked almost flawlessly and to everyone's benefi= t.=20 During the summer, when air conditioners caused California's power use to= =20 peak, many California utilities would supplement their needs by turning to= =20 the Northwest. In the winter, when Northwest electric furnaces are turned o= n=20 for space heating, California utilities would return the favor and ship the= ir=20 surplus power north.=20 Recently, the BPA has had to purchase large blocs of power on the wholesale= =20 market to meet its contractual obligations to its Northwest customers.=20 The same exorbitant wholesale prices that began to plague California last= =20 year have also affected the Northwest, meaning that the BPA has been runnin= g=20 out of money, and is now in danger of defaulting on its debt obligations to= =20 the Treasury.=20 California's deregulation plan has affected energy relations between the tw= o=20 regions in other ways. For example, the BPA has historically sold surplus= =20 power to California for relatively low prices.

California officials= =20 have praised the BPA for its cooperation, but Northwest environmentalists a= nd=20 tribal leaders complain that the BPA has been helping California address it= s=20 energy crisis by selling salmon down the river.=20 The Northwest will be helped by FERC's decision yesterday to extend limited= =20 temporary price restrictions it had imposed in California in the spring to= =20 other Western states during severe shortages. The order should also be good= =20 for California. Without consistent price restrictions throughout the West,= =20 power marketers would simply skip California during an emergency and sell a= t=20 higher prices elsewhere.=20 But not everyone is happy with the decision.

This is a case where= =20 the third time is unlikely to be a charm.=20 As chairman of the Market Surveillance Committee of the California=20 Independent System Operator, the independent committee formed by FERC to=20 monitor the California market, I have analyzed the results of FERC's previo= us=20 attempts. They reveal a misunderstanding of important details of the=20 California electricity market. It is therefore not surprising that they hav= e=20 been ineffective.=20 Starting in November of 2000, FERC acknowledged that wholesale prices in=20 California during the summer of 2000 were unjust and unreasonable. Its=20 December 2000 order implemented the first set of remedies. Both the=20 California Power Exchange Market Monitoring Committee and the committee I= =20 chair pointed out important shortcomings in FERC's analysis of the Californ= ia=20 market and argued that its remedies would most likely harm, rather than=20 enhance, market performance.=20 At this time, FERC also did not order refunds for the unjust and unreasonab= le=20 prices, even though it acknowledged the prices reflected the exercise of=20 market power, which is the ability of a producer to force prices higher. Th= e=20 Federal Power Act requires refunds under these circumstances. But FERC said= =20 it was unable to find specific instances of firms exercising market power.= =20 This makes no sense. If FERC finds that prices indicate market power, then= =20 the generators who bid those prices are exercising market power.=20 Following the implementation of these remedies, conditions in the Californi= a=20 market deteriorated far beyond what had been predicted by the two market=20 monitoring committees. Even though January and February are the lowest dema= nd=20 months of the year, average wholesale electricity prices were almost 10 tim= es=20 higher in 2001 than they were during the same two months of 2000 and almost= =20 double the average price during the summer of 2000. In January, March and= =20 May, California experienced several days of rolling blackouts and had syste= m=20 emergencies almost every day during January and February of 2001.=20 IN April, FERC made another round of market rule changes designed to lead t= o=20 just and reasonable prices. However, in response to growing pressure from= =20 Congress, less than 10 days after these remedies were implemented, FERC=20 enacted its most recent order.=20 Before Congress declares victory, it should verify that FERC's most recent= =20 plan achieves the following two goals.=20 First, the plan should guarantee that the average price of wholesale=20 electricity paid by California over the next two years is equal to the=20 average price that would occur in a competitive electricity market, with=20 California's current supply and demand conditions and fuel costs. The Feder= al=20 Power Act requires not just a high probability of just and reasonable rates= ;=20 it requires that they occur with certainty.=20 The second goal is to alter the incentives faced by all market participants= =20 so that it will no longer be profit-maximizing for a firm to withhold=20 electricity from the market in order to drive up prices.=20 FERC's most recently implemented plan does not achieve either of these goal= s,=20 although it does come closer than any previous attempts.=20 One solution satisfying both of these goals has been proposed to FERC. In a= =20 December report to FERC, the Market Surveillance Committee of the Californi= a=20 ISO proposed a one-time regulatory intervention. This intervention would=20 require that each generator serving California sign a forward contract=20 guaranteeing that California consumers can purchase 75 percent of the=20 generator's expected output over the next two years at a specified=20 competitive benchmark price. Once a firm has signed these forward contracts= ,=20 it is free to sell all remaining energy in the western U.S. wholesale marke= t=20 at whatever price it can obtain.=20 The obligation to provide power under the contracts, and the incentive to= =20 sell 25 percent of power at unrestricted prices, would prevent generators= =20 from withholding power.=20 Unless FERC implements a solution satisfying these two goals, Congress shou= ld=20 require FERC to suspend the market-based pricing authority for all supplier= s=20 in the Western U.S. for the next two years and order all sales during this= =20 period at cost-of-service prices. This will guarantee that FERC meets the= =20 statutory mandate of the Federal Power Act in California.

The order will last until Sept. 30, 2001.=20 The action came after intense pressure by Democrats and the Bush=20 administration on the FERC, whose three Republican and two Democrat members= =20 all voted for the new controls.

Ms. Feinstein withdrew her own price-cap bill pending the outcome of= =20 the new plan.=20 Under the new arrangement, approved unanimously by a reshuffled five-member= =20 Regulatory Commission, price limits will be based on the cost of producing= =20 electricity at the least efficient generator.

The power companies are= =20 owed billions, but the state has accused them of price-gouging. If the=20 parties cannot reach some agreement, an administrative judge will step in a= nd=20 recommend a settlement to the commission instead.=20 Asked at a Senate hearing in Washington today to clarify what he hoped to= =20 accomplish as a result of the two weeks of settlement talks, the commission= 's=20 chairman, Curtis L.

The parties, he explained= ,=20 need two things for the talks to succeed: a deadline and uncertainty.=20 Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California , expressed skepticism abo= ut=20 the undertaking. Ms. Feinstein said at the hearing, held by the Senate Ener= gy=20 and Natural Resources Committee, that she was concerned that the commission= =20 had laid out ''no rules'' for the talks.=20 ''Very little, if any, money has changed hands as a result of prior=20 settlement conferences,'' she said.=20 Many industry executives and state officials have not yet seen the=20 commission's order, and they were scrambling today to figure out exactly wh= at=20 they were being asked to do.=20 ''Without seeing what exactly is in the order, who knows?'' said Sean=20 Gallagher, a staff lawyer for California 's Public Utilities Commission.=20 ''But we wouldn't turn our noses up at participating in negotiations.''=20 Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a=20 coalition of energy traders and electricity generators, noted that the=20 federal regulators' timetable ''has a very short fuse.''

The Independent System Operator, which runs the= =20 state's power grid, released a study in March concluding that Californians= =20 might have been overcharged for electricity by more than $6 billion. One=20 state government negotiator said the California attorney general's office= =20 could file a suit against the power generators in the next few weeks.=20 And as state officials, including Gov.

''This is a market-based mitigation plan that now will extend to 11= =20 Western states.''=20 In fact, it bore some resemblance to a proposal made by 10 leading economis= ts=20 who urged a middle ground between fixed prices and a deregulated electricit= y=20 market. Mr. Davis used their proposal to support his position in favor of= =20 limited price restraints when Mr. Bush visited California .=20 The White House shift from outright opposition to price controls to its mor= e=20 nuanced position today exemplifies how Mr. Bush has tempered his embrace of= =20 completely unfettered markets in recent weeks. He didn't have much choice.= =20 As the threat of blackouts loomed, demands for action rose from officials o= f=20 both parties and from consumers in the West. It was almost possible to hear= =20 sighs of relief at the White House today that the Federal Energy Regulatory= =20 Commission -- an independent body in the Energy Department -- had moved to= =20 turn down the political heat.=20 In fact, while some House Democrats are still pressing for firmer caps on= =20 prices, Senators Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California , and Gordon H.= =20 Smith, Republican of Oregon, withdrew a bill that would have placed strict= =20 price controls on electricity sold in Western markets.=20 Senator Feinstein said the White House could call yesterday's regulatory=20 action ''mitigation'' or anything else it pleased.=20 ''A rose is a rose by any other name,'' she said today.=20 And a free market is not always free. Two weeks ago the administration said= =20 it would rescue steel companies and steelworkers who have long complained= =20 about unfair competition from South Korea, Taiwan, China, Brazil, Germany,= =20 Russia and Ukraine. The White House defended the action by saying it was th= e=20 only way for the industry to adjust to a new competitive environment.=20 Last month, with no major announcements at the White House, the Bush=20 administration voted for International Monetary Fund aid to two countries,= =20 Turkey and Argentina, that (like California ) had made some economically=20 disastrous political decisions.=20 In each case, Mr. Bush's economic orthodoxies were tempered by political=20 realities.=20 The California crisis was one thing when it involved a Democratic governor = in=20 a state Mr. Bush lost by a million votes; it was another, one of his aides= =20 conceded today, when congressional Republicans from around the West were=20 warning Mr. Bush that blackouts and sky-high prices could blow up in his=20 first year in office.=20 ''We heard from a lot of members of Congress who feared that Republicans=20 would be tarred with worsening the problem, even though it happened on Gray= =20 Davis's watch,'' the political aide said. ''The president took that on=20 board.''=20 Similarly, the steel decision was partly about enforcing laws against=20 ''dumping'' foreign products in the market -- and partly about Mr. Bush's= =20 desire to convince labor unions not to block his trade agenda. Like=20 Californians coping with higher energy prices, the steelworkers need time t= o=20 adjust to a new world, the administration said.=20 ''Open markets improve the lives of people by increasing opportunity, choic= e=20 and economic freedom,'' Robert B. Zoellick, Mr. Bush's trade representative= ,=20 said in an interview today. ''But compassionate conservatism also recognize= s=20 the reality that the effects of rapid change fall harder on some communitie= s=20 and industries,'' which, he said, need ''vital breathing space to adapt to= =20 change.''=20 While Mr. Bush expressed deep reservations about I.M.F. bailouts during the= =20 presidential campaign, the situation seemed a bit more complicated once he= =20 got to Washington. The State and Defense Departments feared that if Turkey= =20 were engulfed in economic chaos, and blamed the United States for failing t= o=20 come to its aid, its leaders might be less inclined to let American fighter= =20 jets use its territory to mount missions over Iraq.=20 So given the choice between letting the Turkish people pay a high price for= =20 political mistakes -- Californians take note -- and weakening American=20 pressure on Saddam Hussein, Mr. Bush decided that economic niceties were le= ss=20 important than political consistency. Mr. Bush chose the Pentagon over the= =20 Treasury.=20 Administration officials said these actions did not represent a retreat fro= m=20 let-the-markets-prevail orthodoxy.=20 Lawrence B. Lindsey, Mr. Bush's chief economic adviser, said in an intervie= w=20 today that he opposed price caps at the beginning of the California crisis= =20 and that he opposed them now. But he would not criticize the federal=20 commission for ''mitigating'' price spikes in the market.=20 ''What they are trying to do is achieve two incompatible missions --=20 preserving what is called 'just and reasonable pricing' and assuring an=20 adaquate supply of electricity ,'' Mr. Lindsey said. Yet the reality, he=20 added, is that new supplies of electricity will not become available for a= =20 year or more. ''FERC is doing its best to square that circle in the face of= =20 the fundamental problem, which is inadequate supply,'' he said.=20 That is the kind of argument that keeps economists happily arguing for hour= s.=20 It is not likely to be the kind of argument Mr. Bush himself is likely to= =20 engage in for long. As one of his political advisers said the other day,=20 ''Don't think about this purely in terms of megawatts.

Body:: This morning the FERC had its meeting to discuss events in California and = =20 the FERC=01,s response to them. The following is a summary of the remarks o= f=20 the four Commissioners and the major points of what has been ordered:=20 ? Major features ? 1.? Proposes to replace ISO and PX boards with independent, non-stakeholde= r=20 boards. 2.? Continued significant role for the presidents of PX/ISO, who should be= =20 made voting members. 3.? Elimination of mandated buy-sell requirement for the IOUs (although no= =20 explanation as to whether this requires CPUC action). Over-reliance on spo= t=20 markets has been problematical. 4.? As an independent exchange, the PX will be free to design the products= =20 desired by the market. 5.? The proposed price modification measure will be a temporary measure.= =20 Single price for all offers below $150. However, no bid above $150 will se= t=20 the price for all generators. A seller can bid anything it wants. Allowing = =20 generators to receive their as-bid price will allow high-cost generators to= =20 participate in the market. However, the generator will be required to=20 provide confidential reports to FERC explaining the necessity for bids ove= r=20 $150 through 12/31/02. 6.? The order requires forward scheduling of 95% of an scheduling =20 coordinator=01,s schedule, with a penalty applied for deviations which exce= ed 5%=20 As an incentive, the proceeds of the penalties go to the schedulers who=20 comply with the tolerance band. 7.? Rejects the purchase price caps proposed by the ISO. The order would= =20 eliminate the ISO=01,s price cap authority. 8.? Beginning 1/1/01, the prospect of refunds will be available. =20 ?

It now must go to the Assembly, where there is still a lot of uncertainty about what changes the Assembly will want to the bill. We still haven't seen the latest ""republican"" language. Also, AB 265 is double joined to AB 970, controversial siting bill. To the extent one or the other fails, they both fail. AB 265 (Davis/Alpert) has: 1. a 6.5 cent/kWh energy rate cap through 2002, with potential extension through 2003. 2. Applicable to residential, small commercial (up to 100 kW) 3. Opt-in provision for large industrial/agricultural customers at 6.5 cents with an annual true-up 4. Use of revenues from utility generation assets (including PPA) to offset undercollections. 5.

Subject:: nan
Body:: Vince, I've been hearing rumors that Enron has decided to endorse the nodal pricing model as implemented in PJM. I just wanted to warn you that I'm not sure this is in Enron's long-term interest at all. Let me explain why. Feel free to give me a call if you'd like to talk more about this. First, let me say that I firmly believe in locational pricing and specifically pricing congestion. However, the way that PJM implements nodal pricing is to eliminate as much price volatility and reduce the transparency of the market. Specifically, the PJM tariff gives the ISO the ability to mitigate to cost plus a %10 adder the bids of any market participant that the ISO deems is out of merit in one of the three zones in region. (The fact that a nodal market is talking about zones should give you cause for alarm.) Then the ISO takes this mitigated bid and re-runs its price-setting software to compute new nodal prices. The way I have (somewhat unfairly) decribed this price-setting process is that the PJM ISO decides what prices it would like for a given day and mitigates bids until it gets them. This is not a transparent market, nor one where it makes any sense to buy the risk management services that Enron provides. The only price volatility you have to worry about in the PJM market is that kind that comes about if they need imports into their control area to meet demand. Under these circumstances, you need to pay the imports whatever is necessary to get them to come to your market. However, bear in mind FERC's desire to make a large RTO on the East Coast. This will effectively mean little imports to the East Coast RTO, so all bids can be mitigated at the discretion of the ISO. Paying market-clearing prices to cost-of-service mitigated bids is just paying too much to eliminate price volatility. It effectively kills off the development of risk management at the wholesale and retail level. Power marketing becomes much less profitable because retailers know you can always buy at cost-mitigated prices. In short, the PJM model is not market. It is just an alternative form of regulation that is politically attractive because it reduces price volatility, but it is not good for consumers or traders because they just get a higher cost form of regulation than traditional cost-of-service regulation. You pay market-clearing prices to cost-of-service mitigated bids, but under regulation you could just pay cost-of-service prices and eliminate the infra-marginal profits to low cost generators. As we discussed during our dinner, I think the two biggest sources of benefits from re-structuring will come from getting the demand-side involved in the market and from more efficient risk management. A necessary condition for both of these to occur is prices that reflect actual conditions in the market (including the extent of market power exercised). Masking these signals dulls any incentive for market participants to make the investment necessary to management. The PJM model is just way to have a market in name without achieving any significant benefits to consumers or energy traders. Frank

Subject:: NYTimes.com Article: The Real Wolf

Toshiba is uniting digital, mobile and network innovations in a bold new vision of Information Technology for today and tomorrow. Take a closer look at life in the new Digital Age. And imagine how good IT can be. Visit Toshiba.com for more details. The Real Wolf RECKONINGS By PAUL KRUGMAN ecently I received a letter from an economist I respect, chiding me for my ""Naderite"" columns on the California energy crisis. He just didn't believe that market manipulation by power companies could possibly be an important issue; it sounded too much to him like the sort of thing one hears from knee-jerk leftists, who blame greedy capitalists for every problem, be it third-world poverty or high apartment rents. The left has cried ""Wolf!"" so many times that sensible people have learned to discount such claims. But now a bona fide wolf has arrived, whose predatory behavior is doing terrible damage to our most populous state - and nobody will believe it. True, California would be heading for a summer of power shortages even if it had never deregulated. And even if there was workable competition in the wholesale electricity market, prices in that market would spike during periods of peak demand, transferring billions of dollars from either taxpayers or consumers to the generators. But the evidence is now overwhelming that there isn't workable competition in California's power market, and that the actions of generators ""gaming the system"" have greatly magnified the crisis. The key fact is that California has somehow remained in a state of more or less continuous power shortage and very high wholesale prices regardless of the level of demand. A rash of outages has kept the electricity market conveniently - and very profitably - short of supply even during periods of low demand, when there ought to be lots of excess capacity. As Frank Wolak, the Stanford economist who also advises the state's power grid, has pointed out, an outage at a power plant is a lot like an employee calling in sick. You can't tell directly whether he is really sick or has chosen to take the day off for other reasons, but you can look for circumstantial evidence. And such evidence has convinced Mr. Wolak that ""generators use forced outages strategically to withhold capacity from the market"" - a view shared by a growing number of other researchers. Which brings us to the latest move by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. On Wednesday, the commission apparently decided to offer California some relief, and put new price caps in place on the California electricity market. I say ""apparently"" because the more you look at the plan the less likely it seems to be any help at all. Indeed, the measure was passed on a 2-to-1 vote, with William Massey - the one commissioner who has been sympathetic to calls for price controls - voting against it on the grounds that it would be ineffectual. What's wrong with FERC's plan? First, it caps prices only in emergency conditions - ignoring the fact that electricity prices have stayed at hard- to-explain levels even when there is no emergency. In effect, the plan is laid out as if the electricity market were really competitive, in spite of all the evidence that it is not. Second, even those emergency price caps are full of loopholes, offering extensive opportunities for what Mr. Wolak calls ""megawatt laundering"" - selling power to affiliated companies that for one reason or another are exempted from the price controls (for example, the controls do not apply to ""imports"" from neighboring states), then selling it back into the California market. Severin Borenstein of the University of California Energy Institute adds that because the allowed price depends on the cost of generation at the least efficient plant, generators will have a clear incentive to produce inefficiently: ""I predict we will find some plants we never heard of before that are suddenly operating again, and they will be pretty inefficient."" The general verdict seems to be that this is not a serious plan. There are serious proposals to mitigate the crisis out there - indeed, last fall Mr. Wolak submitted a proposal that was well received by other experts - but FERC has ignored all of them. The charitable interpretation is that FERC still doesn't get it, that it just can't bring itself to believe that this time the wolf is real. The uncharitable interpretation is that last week's action was meant to fail. The Medley Report, an online newsletter, calls the FERC plan ""a grand exercise in posturing without substance . . . a very clever temporary move by the Bush administration to deflect any political fallout"" from the looming disaster. Whatever the explanation, the plain fact is that FERC and the administration have yet to offer California any significant relief.

Subject:: EPSA Meeting Today On Barton RTO Draft
Body:: The EPSA Leg. Affairs Committee is having a special meeting this afternoon (out of the normal biweekly cycle) to discuss how EPSA should respond to the Barton RTO discussion draft. In addition to the e-mail yesterday morning, I spoke in person with Gene Peters of the EPSA staff to convey our strongly held view that mere ""technical corrections"" were not enough to fix the Barton RTO proposal, as the EPSA draft letter stated. Gene came around because in a subsequent meeting we had with Rep. Chip Pickering (R-MS), a member of the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee, Gene said that silence would be better than what is in the Barton draft. He did indicate to me (not to Pickering) that some EPSA members, without naming them, didn't want to come down too hard on Barton because in their view the draft could have been worse. These unnamed companies (or company?) claim to have told of earlier versions not released that would have been more restrictive on FERC's discretion. Some companies also think FERC could wiggle out of the strictures of the draft. I told Gene that there is no way to wiggle out of the definitions of minimum size/scope that FERC would be forced to accept and the various procedural advantages for recalcitrant utilities. While I am checking with counterparts at other EPSA members in advance of the afternoon meeting, you might want to do the same as you speak with contacts at other EPSA members. I am confident we can get the EPSA letter to better reflect our position -- my suspicion is that the unnamed company Gene referred to is Reliant, but I can't prove it. John

Generators deny gouging.=20 By NANCY VOGEL and JENIFER WARREN, Times Staff Writers ?????SACRAMENTO--Wholesale electricity suppliers overcharged California's= =20 utilities more than $500 million during December and January, an amount tha= t=20 the federal government should demand be refunded, according to a=20 no-holds-barred state report released Thursday. ?????The report by the California Independent System Operator, which overse= es=20 the flow of electricity in the state, said power suppliers charged $11=20 billion during those two months alone--more than they did for all of 1999. ?????Studying various market dynamics, the agency concluded that there was = a=20 ""prima facie case"" that the unnamed generators and marketers had charged $5= 62=20 million above ""just and reasonable"" prices, warranting further investigatio= n=20 and federal hearings into the appropriateness of refunds. ?????The state report is the most accusatory of a number of studies=20 undertaken to determine why wholesale electricity prices have soared in=20 California since last summer, throwing the state's biggest utilities into= =20 financial crisis and dashing hopes for lower consumer rates under=20 deregulation. ?????The study also provides new ammunition to members of California's=20 congressional delegation, who have unsuccessfully been pressing the Federal= =20 Energy Regulatory Commission to impose price ceilings on wholesale=20 electricity costs. ?????Generators defended their operating practices and rejected the=20 allegation that they had raked in unfairly large profits in December and=20 January. ?????""We have played by the rules, acted ethically and legally in all our= =20 operations,"" said Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Houston-based Reliant= =20 Energy, which owns power plants capable of supplying more than 3 million=20 homes. ""We have nothing to hide."" ?????Gary Ackerman, executive direcor of the Western Power Trading Forum,= =20 said the Cal-ISO report does not account for less tangible factors that ten= d=20 to drive up prices, such as political and financial uncertainties. ?????""Those are the things my people take into account when deciding whethe= r=20 to sell into California,"" said Ackerman. He noted that, in the second week = of=20 December, a period analyzed in the Cal-ISO report, electricity prices were= =20 higher in the Pacific Northwest than in California. ?????The report, he said, ""provides some reasonable questions which will be= =20 responded to by my members, under FERC authority."" ?????Cal-ISO officials stressed Thursday that they are not accusing any=20 seller of inflating prices but are simply asking for federal action to=20 restrain costs. ?????""We have not seen prices come down to what we feel are justifiable=20 levels,"" said Anjali Sheffrin, director of market analysis for Cal-ISO. ?????Although federal energy commission officials on Thursday refused to=20 comment on the study, many experts predicted that refunds would not be=20 forthcoming. ?????Since July, when Gov. Gray Davis first asked the federal commission to= =20 give San Diego Gas & Electric customers refunds for electricity costs that= =20 doubled and in some cases tripled, the agency has refused to order power=20 sellers to give back some of their profits to California utilities and=20 consumers. ?????The commission, charged by Congress with assuring ""just and reasonable= ""=20 wholesale electricity rates, has also resisted imposing firm price caps on= =20 California's electricity market. In November, the commission called that=20 market ""dysfunctional"" and vulnerable to manipulation by power sellers, but= =20 the agency has so far failed to document or punish specific cases of such= =20 anti-competitive behavior. ?????""The real question is what is FERC going to do with all of this?"" said= =20 Gary Stern, chief of market analysis for Southern California Edison, once o= ne=20 of the two biggest buyers of electricity in California. ""Based on past=20 history, we think they're probably going to say they don't see wrongdoing= =20 that provides a reason for refund."" ?????Determining rebates could prove a logistical nightmare for federal=20 regulators and Cal-ISO, Stern said, but the data exist to show how much it= =20 cost power plant owners to generate electricity and what price they charged= . ?????Given that Edison and PG&E have defaulted on payments of hundreds of= =20 millions to power sellers, Stern said, a rebate order wouldn't lead to=20 reimbursement for individual utility customers. Instead, it could help the= =20 utilities eliminate some of their debt to generators and marketers. ?????Edison and PG&E have been pushed nearly to bankruptcy by high wholesal= e=20 costs, which they could not pass on to their customers because of a=20 state-imposed rate freeze.=20 ?????Last week, Davis announced that Edison had agreed in principle to stat= e=20 financial help in exchange for its transmission lines. Negotiations with PG= &E=20 continue. ?????The Folsom-based Cal-ISO drew its conclusions after reviewing=20 electricity purchases made between Dec. 8, 2000, and Jan. 31, 2001. ?????To calculate the cost of producing electricity in those months, Cal-IS= O=20 analysts assumed power plant owners were buying natural gas from the spot= =20 market, where prices soared this winter, and were running old, inefficient= =20 plants. They also assumed relatively high prices for air emission credits i= n=20 Southern California and added a 10% buffer to the operating costs. ?????Cal-ISO officials then compared these costs with the prices sellers we= re=20 paid. Their report did not name the individual sellers, which range from th= e=20 province of British Columbia to the publicly owned Los Angeles Department o= f=20 Water and Power to private companies. ?????Several lawmakers praised the report as long overdue. ?????""It's about time,"" said state Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey),=20 chairwoman of the Senate Energy Committee. She said that the desire among= =20 some legislators to seize power plants and take other drastic actions stems= =20 from the sense that ""there's no one willing to enforce the provisions of th= e=20 federal power act regarding just and reasonable rates. ?????""The utilities are doing a great job looking out for their shareholder= s,=20 but who is looking out for ratepayers?"" she asked. ?????Consumer advocacy groups applauded Cal-ISO's action and said the=20 agency's evidence of overcharges underscored the need for hard price caps o= r=20 a tax on generator profits. ?????""It's certainly not news to us that the generators are charging=20 excessive wholesale prices,"" said Mindy Spatt, spokeswoman for the Utility= =20 Reform Network of San Francisco.

Subject:: Confidential - Decision tree on projects
Body:: Something for us to talk about during our next staff meeting. There are three projects which have significant cash flow problems and thus= difficulties in meeting debt obligations: these are: SECLP, Panama and Gaz= a. In the past, as I suppose we have done in Dabhol, we have taken the pos= ition that we would not inject cash into these companies and would be prepa= red to face a default and possible acceleration of the loans. SECLP has be= en the biggest issue/problem. Panama is much less (a few million of floati= ng of our receivables from the company) would be sufficient to meet the cas= h crunch in April of this year. Note that, in Panama, the debt is fully gu= aranteed by the government and is non-recoursed to the operating company, B= LM. In the past, we have discussed letting the debt default, which would c= ause the bank to potentially seek complete payment and acceleration from th= e GoPanama. The reason: the vast majority of BLM's problems stem from acti= ons taken by the regulator that have effectively amended our PPA's with pri= vate parties; those actions resulted in significant loss of revenues, which= although today have stopped or have been limited, have left a ""mark"" on th= e company's liquidity position. =20 Now the question is: come April of 2002, should any of our actions in Panam= a or decisions related thereto (which we would have otherwise taken or made= ) be affected in any way by either the proposed merger or an effort by Enro= n to preserve efforts to re-establish investor/creditor confidence? The sa= me could go for SECLP and Gaza. This is simply an overall ""guidance"" question. Let's take it up during our= staff meeting next week, if that's ok with you. Many thanks, Mariella

Subject:: WSP: Market Ripe for Manipulation...
Body:: Cc list suppressed... Public opinion is the pendulum that swings law...dsg August 4, 2000 Deregulation Leaves Electricity Market Ripe for Manipulation by Power Firms By REBECCA SMITH and JOHN J. FIALKA Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL It's a market ripe for manipulation: surging demand for an indispensable commodity, weak oversight and a chaotic new set of rules amid a transition from heavy regulation to open competition. This is the state of the U.S. electricity business in the summer of 2000. And sure enough, there's growing evidence that some power companies are finding lucrative ways to exploit the system -- at consumers' expense. The tactics include manipulating wholesale electricity auctions, taking juice from transmission systems when suppliers aren't supposed to and denying weaker competitors access to transmission lines. None of this is illegal, and much of it might be considered basic competition. But as an electricity shortage plunges sweltering California into an energy crisis and fears of even worse shortages rattle the Northeast, the practices of power suppliers face more scrutiny than ever. (See related article.) Steamy Conditions A hot summer day last year shows one kind of manipulation. On July 28, 1999, wholesale electricity prices in the Middle Atlantic states hit $935 per megawatt hour. That was seven times what it costs to generate power at the most expensive plant in the region. An analysis of trading data from that day shows that PECO Energy Corp. and PPL Corp., the old Philadelphia Electric Co. and Pennsylvania Power & Light, made the most of steamy conditions. In the region's power market, deregulated in 1997, a new corporation called PJM Interconnection LLC runs the transmission system once operated piecemeal by eight utilities. It also operates a daily electricity auction that sorts the hourly bids of 540 generating plants. The cheapest plants are called on first, but when the weather is hot and demand is acute, higher offers are taken as well. To attract as many bidders as possible, the highest bid, each hour, sets the price for the entire market for that hour. Grid and Bear It Rise in average wholesale electricity prices at key transmission-interconnection points for the month of May from 1997 to 2000. TRANSMISSION-INTERCONNECTION POINT % CHANGE 1997-2000 Texas +293% +216 Tennessee Valley Authority +165 California-Oregon border +162 New York-West +138 Chicago area +130 New England +117 New York-East +101 Upper Midwest +99 Florida +89 Mid-Atlantic region +80* *Includes only years 1999-2000 Source: Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, RDI Power What PECO and PPL did was offer much of their output at low prices so that the majority of their plants would be called into service. But knowing demand was so high, they offered power from their tiniest plants at vastly higher bids, in a way that often set the peak price for a number of hours. Consumers that day ended up paying millions of extra dollars for power. Cases like this show that during the transition to deregulation, ""there's a good argument the system has broken down,"" says William Massey, a commissioner at the Federal Energy Regulatory Agency. FERC, which polices the nation's bulk power markets, began the deregulation movement in 1996. It wasn't supposed to be this way. In the old days, utilities generated electricity and delivered it to customers in exclusive territories. To protect consumers from gouging, rates were regulated. But while supply had to be able to meet peak demand at all times, demand varied widely within regions, between regions and from one season to another. The result was tremendous reliability but also inefficiency and waste. Deregulation, now under way in half the country and functioning nationally at the wholesale level, allows new players -- some affiliated with utilities, some not -- to build power plants and sell electricity. Prices are supposed to be set by competitive markets. Risks are borne by investors, not ratepayers. At the same time, utilities are surrendering control of long-haul transmission lines to new nonprofit operators, like the one in the Middle Atlantic region, which are supposed to ensure fair access to the grid -- the multistate system of high voltage lines. Under this new regime, energy prices should have dropped as companies raced to compete with one another. But the massive U.S. energy infrastructure wasn't designed to serve as the backbone of a free market. On hot summer days, when there's little or no surplus electricity in the nation's most populous regions, generators can charge prices far in excess of their production costs and be confident they'll get tapped for service by grid operators who must keep the lights on at any cost. Utility holding companies that still control transmission lines have an added advantage: They can effectively lock out cheaper competitors. California Cuts Price Cap for Electricity Once Again (Aug. 2)Price Cap Is Set for Electricity That Is Sold in New England (July 27)PPL, KeySpan Say Earnings Surpassed Wall Street Targets (July 27)Energy Trading, Internet Operations Help Enron's Net Income Jump 30% (July 25)PG&E Posts 36% Rise in Net to $248 Million (July 21) The new regional grid operators, called independent system operators, or ISOs, eventually will be in charge of preventing manipulation. But as nongovernmental organizations, they won't have basic investigative tools, like subpoena powers or the ability to impose significant penalties. FERC, which does have those powers, rarely uses them, preferring to let the market discipline itself. A Strange Drop Sometimes it's difficult to know what constitutes an abuse of the market. In July 1999, engineers noticed that a substantial amount of power was being taken from the grid for which there was no explanation. They contacted the North American Electric Reliability Council, the industry group charged by Congress with overseeing the grid since the late 1960s. After a lengthy investigation, NERC determined that Cinergy Corp., a utility holding company, had surreptitiously taken enough power over a three-day period, about 9,600 megawatt hours, to light a small city for a month. Cincinnati-based Cinergy had underestimated power demands. Rather than buy electricity on the open market at ferociously high prices or cut power to Cincinnati, it quietly borrowed power from the system when demand was peaking and later replaced it in the cool of the night when demand wasn't so high. James E. Rogers, Cinergy's chief executive, received a letter from A.R. Garfield, the chairman of NERC's regional power-coordination center, accusing his company of showing ""blatant disregard"" for the rules and of using the grid ""as a supplemental resource without regard to the reliability or integrity of the system."" But Cinergy paid no fine. That's because it runs its own transmission ""control area"" and is trusted to enforce NERC's voluntary rules, even when it is the violator. Smaller utilities in Cinergy's area, by contrast, face contractual penalties of as much as $35,000 per megawatt for unilaterally borrowing from the grid, a practice known as ""leaning on the ties."" Dancing on the Edge? Mr. Garfield is still steamed about Cinergy's actions, which he said removed part of the system's essential reserve needed to avoid cascading blackouts, or a chain of uncontrollable outages that could darken whole sectors of the country. ""How fair is it that someone can dance on the edge like that and get away with it?"" he asks. Mr. Rogers points to old rules that permit utilities to temporarily borrow small amounts of power during emergencies. ""We were very careful to make sure, when we leaned on the ties ... we didn't bring the whole system down,"" he says. Nevertheless, he concedes, ""in a competitive world, those rules need to be changed."" The region's regulators have since gone to FERC for authority to charge ""borrowers"" for the market value of the electricity they take off the grid. Leaning on the ties is only one way fair competition is being frustrated on the country's transmission system, a vast web of connections that resembles the nation's highway system before the construction of the interstates. While there are plenty of routes to get electricity from outlying power plants directly to big cities, there are relatively few routes connecting regions. That makes it possible for some big companies to shut out competitors. A Snag in Transmission St. Louis-based Aquila Energy hit that snag when it tried to use a transmission corridor owned by New Orleans-based Entergy Corp. to move electricity to a buyer in East Texas. Entergy granted the request, initially, but then it canceled, saying it didn't have sufficient space on its lines. Aquila didn't buy it. After analyzing transmission-capacity data, the company argued to FERC that Entergy did have enough space on its lines and so was in effect breaking a rule that required it to provide transmission-line access when possible. Without access to Entergy's lines, Aquila was forced to compensate the buyer and lost nearly $300,000 on the deal. From whom did the Texas customer end up buying the power? A unit of Entergy -- and for a higher price than it would have paid Aquila. FERC said Entergy had been within its rights to restrict access in this case, because it had transmission problems. But FERC found that Entergy, on other occasions, had hoarded transmission capacity that should have been made available to the market. Entergy declines to comment. Such scenarios are costly for consumers, and they are among the reasons the electricity industry is enjoying flush times. In the second quarter just ended, companies ranging from AES Corp. in Arlington, Va., to Enron Corp. in Houston reported huge profit increases, some as much as 50%. To be sure, a lot of those profits are coming from extraordinary demand growth and a pickup in energy trading. But Sean Murphy, president of Southern Energy New England, a unit of Southern Cos., Atlanta, Ga., worries that the industry has gotten too greedy and risks retribution. ""Pigs get fat, but hogs get slaughtered,"" he says. Tremendous Volatility New federal data show that average wholesale power prices have more than doubled at 14 of 17 key pricing points across the country in the past three years. By May of this year, prices had risen across a broad range -- by 89% in Florida, for example, and by 294% in Texas. But even these increases mask the tremendous volatility that has struck all the major wholesale markets during the past year. In the case of the Midwest, where prices in July 1999 hit $9,000 per megawatt hour, it was as if a $1.89 gallon of gas suddenly sold for $567. Prices like these have prompted growing calls for investigations into whether electric companies are gouging their customers. Some consumer groups, lukewarm to deregulation in the first place, now are agitating for re-regulation. Residential electricity bills have doubled in San Diego, which is notable because it's the first city in the nation to be served by a utility that's buying all of its energy on the competitive market. Politicians are sounding the alarm in the Pacific Northwest. There, wholesale prices peaked at a record $1,300 per megawatt hour during the last week in June. Energy-intensive industries like mines and aluminum smelters are cutting back on production and temporarily laying off workers. ""We may be seeing too much opportunism in the market,"" says Montana Gov. Marc Racicot. Demands by Mr. Racicot and his counterpart in Washington, Gary Locke, were instrumental in prompting FERC to open a national investigation in late July into possible market abuses. A Six-Month Lag One big premise on which deregulation rests is that a free flow of information will let markets police themselves and operate efficiently. But a key tool for market monitoring, the data on utility Web sites used to book transmission orders, is often unreliable. There's a six-month lag on the release of bidding data, which are coded to mask the identities of bidders. What's more, the four FERC-controlled ISOs operating in California, the Middle Atlantic states, New England and New York don't have the authority to compel market participants to give them internal documents, like bilateral contracts, and other information they don't want to hand over. Without such documents, ""there's a lot more looking than finding,"" says Bill Museler, chief executive of the New York ISO. Even if the ISOs do find something problematic, there isn't much they can do about it. The tariffs, contracts and bylaws under which they operate generally prohibit them from releasing company-specific data and so exposing wrongdoers. And with the exception of California, the ISOs' own board meetings are closed to the public. ""The reality is, confidentiality rules protect the guilty,"" says Frank Wolak, a professor of economics at Stanford University and chairman of the California ISO's Market Surveillance Committee. ""And there are no codes of conduct to instill a sense of fair play."" That can be a huge problem on hot days. In California, an independent exchange runs a daily forward auction in which it tries to match the next day's anticipated demand to bids by generators. But this summer, generators often have offered less power than they know will be needed, so that they can submit higher bids later when the ISO is forced to pay stiffer prices for emergency power. On occasion, ISO engineers have had just 40 minutes to frantically phone around and nail down suppliers, knowing that if they fail they could be forced to begin rolling blackouts. The bidding strategy, while legal, ""undermines reliability and forces the ISO to do some real gymnastics,"" says Kellan Fluckiger, chief operations officer for the California ISO. Generators say they aren't to blame for the mad scramble. Utilities, buying power for their customers, often order less power than they really need for fear that a big order will drive up the overall market price to prohibitive levels. The only real recourse available to the ISOs is to rewrite the rules governing their local markets. But FERC is reluctant to let them meddle too often because generators are investing billions of dollars based on existing market rules. There's another reason, too, says Ron Rattey, a veteran FERC economist who in June wrote a 10-page internal memo criticizing the agency for not doing more to ferret out unfair conduct. ""Every single ISO has identified strategic abuses,"" he says. ""And every time the ISOs make adjustments to the rules, the market participants find new ways around them.""

Subject:: Southeast RTO: Southern's Load
Body:: The Barton discussion draft says that FERC's hands would be tied and that they would have to approve a proposed RTO, as to size and scope, if the proposed RTO owns or has operational control over transmission facilities that serve at least 40,000 MW of load. Southern's CEO testified in Congress recently that their load is over 35,000. I assume the 40,000 MW minimum would permit the SeTrans proposal to meet the proposed statutory minimum since it is Southern plus a few munis, as I understand it. Is this correct? Who would know how many RTOs there would be if each were just over the 40,000 MW minimum? I assume it is much more than 4-5 RTOs -- if so, this is a good contrast to use in our Hill efforts. Thanks.

Subject:: RE: Important - CPUC Motion - Confidential Attorney ClientPrivil
 ege and Work Product
Body:: While I appreciate the virtue of flying below the radar if possible, the matter here is complicated by the fact that FERC's discovery rules (18 CFR, Subpart D) pertain only to ""proceedings set for hearing . . . and to such proceedings as the Commission may order."" 18 CFR 385.401. In this case, FERC stated that ""a trial-type hearing is not necessary . . . ."" and specifically rejected the use of a ""trial-type evidentiary hearing."" Slip op. at 47-48 & n.97. Thus, while I have not researched the matter as yet, my preliminary view is that the CPUC's attempt to invoke FERC's discovery processes would appear to be outside the contemplation of FERC's Nov. 1 order and its regulations, unless FERC specifically orders discovery in this case. (The CPUC seems to recognize the relevance of this consideration when it specifically attempts to equate ""paper"" hearings with ""trial-type"" hearings; see page 1 of its Motion.) The CPUC's motion may prompt FERC to decide whether or not to allow discovery in this case under Rule 401. While the CPUC's motion does not apply directly to marketers, FERC's ruling will be precedent in the event the CPUC or someone else hereafter serves discovery on other parties. As a result, we need to consider whether laying in the weeds risks losing an opportunity to present our views on whether FERC should allow discovery in a paper hearing with an expedited decisional track, particularly in light of the fact that Staff has already conducted. >>> Jeffrey Watkiss 11/08/00 10:31AM >>> Does anyone have an idea as to why marketers, including EPMI, are not included in the list of subject companies: Exh. B? Since EPMI is not a subject of the motion, why should it answer? Lying in the weeds may be a more prudent course of action. >>> ""Fergus, Gary S."" <GFergus@brobeck.com> 11/07/00 10:08PM >>> I just spoke with Mary to make sure we have the same information. Here are the facts we have so far. On November 4th, the CPUC filed a motion with FERC to adopt the form of protective order that the CPUC entered, to compel the production of documents and to shorten time to answer. According to Exhibit B (read to me by Nancy Pickover at Bracewell) the following CPUC moved against the following entities: AES, Williams, Duke, Dynegy, Reliant and Southern. Enron entities were NOT named in exhibit B. This is not to say that we could not be easily added to the group. While the motion reads as if the CPUC was moving against everybody, in fact, in footnote 2 they state they are only moving against the entities named in Exhibit B. We will have Exhibit B in hand first thing tomorrow via FEDEX to confirm this. To repeat, Enron is not named yet.

Given the timing, we should discuss this on our conference call scheduled for tomorrow. They request that we be required: to answer their motion on Thursday, to provide the information within 5 working days of a FERC ordering production, and to provide of P&L information and spread sheets detailing our deals, specifically delivery point, delivery date, counterparty, volume and price. We may not have a problem providing this information for use by FERC in its proceeding subject to a confidentiality agreement but I think we would oppose their requests for: the information to be provided for ""government eyes only"" - this would prohibit EPMI from defending itself vis-a-vis other market participants. a FERC confidentiality order that would could allow FERC to ""share"" this information with the CPUC (for purposes of the PUC's OII proceeding) pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 824h(c). 16 USC 824g(c) requires the Commission to make information available to state commissions as may be of assistance in state regulation of public utilities. We should argue that 16 USC 824h(c) does not apply here given that we are not a public utility nor does the PUC regulate how much market power wholesale marketers exercise or the level of market power mitigation (these are the bases the PUC provides for explaining why it should have this information.) the above contractual information to allow them to analyze the competitiveness of the forward market to evaluate the wisdom of the Commission's decision to allow the UDC's ""unfettered access"" to the forwards market. This argument is unpersuasive given that the CPUC can get information about the competitiveness of the forward markets from the Wall Street Journal's listing of NYMEX prices.

Subject:: Confidential re: McConville--Indemnity
Body:: David, As we discussed, Mark Haedicke and I discussed the possibility of providing Kevin McConville with some sort of indemnity in order to make sure that he remains available and cooperative during the pendency of the NSM case and other litigation matters. We could agree to enter into a Consulting Services Agreement with Kevin. The terms of that Agreement would include: 1. He agrees to be available and cooperative with Enron and its counsel regarding litigation matters. He will agree to meet with counsel, prepare for testimony, review documents, testify, and provide other assistance, as needed. 2. Through February 1, 2001, Kevin would not be directly compensated for this cooperation/testimony (because he is to be receiving his salary pursuant to the terms of his employment agreement). After Feb.1, 2001, he will be paid a rate of $125 per hour for his services in this regard. 3. Enron would agree to indemnify Kevin for his conduct taken in the ordinary course and scope of his employment with Enron, up to the last date of his employment with Enron. Excluded from this indemnity would be allegations or claims based upon the following: -- any conduct that is outside the course and scope of Kevin's employment, -- any conduct violating policies of Enron or ENA, -- Kevin's intentional acts, -- Kevin's gross negligence, -- Kevin's reckless conduct, -- conduct that is in violation of any law, statute, regulation, or other legal obligation, or -- the commission of an unlawful or illegal act. 4. Kevin would invoice Enron for time spent in performing the services after 2/1/01. The invoice would be paid within 30 days of receipt. In addition, all related expenses would be reimbursed throughout the term of the agreement. Let me know if you have any questions or require additional information. I am available to participate in your call with him, if you would like me to attend. Michelle

There are three projects which have significant cash flow problems and thus difficulties in meeting debt obligations: these are: SECLP, Panama and Gaza. In the past, as I suppose we have done in Dabhol, we have taken the position that we would not inject cash into these companies and would be prepared to face a default and possible acceleration of the loans. SECLP has been the biggest issue/problem. Panama is much less (a few million of floating of our receivables from the company) would be sufficient to meet the cash crunch in April of this year. Note that, in Panama, the debt is fully guaranteed by the government and is non-recoursed to the operating company, BLM. In the past, we have discussed letting the debt default, which would cause the bank to potentially seek complete payment and acceleration from the GoPanama. The reason: the vast majority of BLM's problems stem from actions taken by the regulator that have effectively amended our PPA's with private parties; those actions resulted in significant loss of revenues, which although today have stopped or have been limited, have left a ""mark"" on the company's liquidity position. Now the question is: come April of 2002, should any of our actions in Panama or decisions related thereto (which we would have otherwise taken or made) be affected in any way by either the proposed merger or an effort by Enron to preserve efforts to re-establish investor/creditor confidence? The same could go for SECLP and Gaza. This is simply an overall ""guidance"" question. Let's take it up during our staff meeting next week, if that's ok with you. Many thanks, Mariella

Subject:: Security question
Body:: Dear guys Having been out of the office for a couple of days, I've found myself the victim of theft (again). This time my desk drawer key has been stolen from its ""hiding place"" under my telephone. I *always* lock my drawers and keep the key in the same place, but on arriving in the office today I found the drawers unlocked, and the key missing. Although there's nothing sensitive on or around my desk, I'm concerned about the security implications of someone sniffing around the office in this manner. I also found the papers on my desk extensively reshuffled last week. Last year, in our old office, I had my only two real options books stolen from among the many and varied books on my desk. That couldn't have been a random theft, and I fear this isn't either. I can't understand who'd be so interested in a Research guy's belongings! Can we ask security to check their surveillance footage for any suspicious activity around my desk? Cheers, Steve

ROCKAFELLAR Email: Postal: University of Washington Department of Applied Mathematics 408 L Guggenheim Hall Box 352420 Seattle, WA 98195-2420 USA ABSTRACT: Fundamental properties of conditional value-at-risk, as a measure of risk with significant advantages over value-at-risk, are derived for loss distributions in finance that can involve discreetness. Such distributions are of particular importance in applications because of the prevalence of models based on scenarios and finite sampling. Conditional value-at-risk is able to quantify dangers beyond value-at-risk, and moreover it is coherent. It provides optimization shortcuts which, through linear programming techniques, make practical many large-scale calculations that could otherwise be out of reach. The numerical efficiency and stability of such calculations, shown in several case studies, are illustrated further with an example of index tracking. Keywords: Value-at-risk, conditional value-at-risk, mean shortfall, coherent risk measures, risk sampling, scenarios, hedging, index tracking, portfolio optimization, risk management JEL Classification: G0 John D.
