Obviously, we would need to be judicious about how we used such information (we don't want to aggravate the government), but having such an analysis may be helpful in showing the progress made and in discouraging overly punitive action by the government.

I was flying over Bolivia's Chiquitano Forest as I read your article on the ""old-time gas company"" Enron [BUSINESS, Aug. 28]. Over the past year, this forest, the largest remnant of intact primary dry tropical forest in the world, has been bisected by a 30-ft.-wide gash for construction of a gas pipeline by Enron and Shell. Enron in its quest for profit has ignored the scientific advice of conservation organizations to maintain the ecological integrity of this endangered forest ecosystem. Enron and Shell decided to open the 10 million- acre forest to fragmentation and deforestation by their pipeline. Enron may be keeping pace with advancing technologies to plow ahead in global markets, but its environmental practices are Byzantine and pose a global threat to biodiversity. PATRICIA CAFFREY World Wildlife Fund-Bolivia Santa Cruz, Bolivia Arena foes launch bid to defeat new plan By ERIC BERGER Copyright 2000 Houston Chronicle Wednesday, October 4, 2000 A handful of activists, including a Harris County Green Party official and several low-tax proponents, launched an effort Tuesday to defeat a second plan to build a downtown arena. Unlike the 1999 opposition campaign, this year's anti-arena movement is not seeking a better financing deal for taxpayers. These activists want no arena at all. Although this year's opponents lack the nearly $700,000 their higher-profile predecessors spent last year, that has done little to diminish their rhetoric. ""Should we spend our city's limited resources on building up rich guys, or do we spend it building up our communities?"" asked activist DeWayne Lark, standing in front of City Hall. ""There will be no more corporate welfare in Harris County."" Pro-arena campaign officials said Tuesday's event, which came about three weeks after their own kickoff, was more notable for who did not attend than for who did. Houston Aeros owner Chuck Watson, who funded a large chunk of last year's anti-arena effort, has endorsed the new deal. Gracie Saenz, a former city councilwoman and mayoral candidate who campaigned against the 1999 deal, also supports the new agreement. And although the Harris County Republican Party -- the primary organizer of the 1999 anti-arena effort -- has declined to support the new deal, it has not been as active in opposition as some of its members had hoped. In the GOP's stead this year is the Harris County Green Party, represented by Nathalie Paravicini, who said she rejects the argument that professional sports are critical to a city's identity. Arena boosters say a new downtown facility will promote Houston's image as a world-class city. ""Civic pride is not measured by a sports team that is ready to leave town at the drop of a hat,"" she said. And organizers of the anti-arena campaign also suggested that conservative political activist Bruce Hotze would announce plans Thursday to take a major role in their efforts, possibly becoming campaign manager. Although Hotze lacks the political and financial stature of the pro-arena campaign co-chairmen, Enron Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lay and former Reliant Energy Chairman Don Jordan, he comes from a politically active family that can raise large amounts of money. Hotze has said he does not believe government should be involved in building sports stadiums, but he has declined to say how much he was willing to get involved in the anti-arena effort. Lark said Hotze told him that he will actively raise funds to fight the arena. The group is expected to form a political action committee this week to collect contributions. The philosophy of the anti-sports-arena efforts has reverted to its 1996 form, when a similar grass-roots effort coalesced to oppose the referendum to build a baseball stadium, which voters approved. That underfunded effort also opposed any public spending on stadiums, rather than merely trying to extract a better deal from team owners. Arena proponents this year have attracted most of their former foes, and certainly the best-known, to their ranks by altering the original proposal, which failed with voters last year by 10 percentage points. Still, they acknowledge that there will always be opposition in high-profile contests. ""We never expected this to be a unanimous vote,"" said Jordan, the co-chairman of the pro-arena campaign, Let's Build it Together. ""Some people will vote against anything."" FRANCE: Europe online power markets seen pressuring brokers. By Stuart Penson 10/03/2000 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2000. PARIS, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Online trading is set to sweep through Europe's power markets, sending transaction fees sharply lower and piling the pressure on traditional brokers, industry executives and consultants said on Tuesday. Scores of web-based trading platforms, offering a variety of functions, are expected to enter the European wholesale power market in the near term, forcing brokers who work over the telephone to rethink their approach, they told an energy conference. ""Transaction fees in Europe are already falling and I think we're going to see a big decline over the next six months,"" said Gilbert Toppin, principal of Deloitte Consulting's European e-business practice. ""Voice broking could become a distant memory,"" he told Reuters during the Powerisk 2000 conference. Leading the online charge in Europe's wholesale power market are EnronOnline, which launched last year, and HoustonStreet.com, which started up last week and is already planning to expand into Scandinavia. EnronOnline is a bilateral market in which Enron is always one party to a deal. HoustonStreet is a multilateral exchange. The major advantages for online markets over telephone brokers are seen as lower transaction costs and the ability to display a far wider range of prices to clients. Also, online trading is anonymous, which is attractive to traders, said Mark Crosno, president of electronic trading services at Altra Energy Technologies of the US. Altra is a partner with National Grid in EnMO in the UK, a consortium which runs a screen-based gas trading market and is planning to launch a power exchange. Many traditional brokers are still deciding how to respond to the online challenge. ""A lot of brokers are scratching their heads because there are going to be 20 or 25 electronic exchanges out there,"" said Per-Otto Wold, managing director of Natsource-Tullett Europe, one of Europe's biggest power brokers. Wold argued that doing a trade over the telephone was still, in most cases, the quickest method. And that would remain so until voice recognition enabled traders to ""talk"" to the screens on their desks. He expected brokers to focus on longer dated trades and options while online markets would capture a greater share of trading in short term, high volume contracts. The provision of market information and traders' liking for personal contact over the telephone would also help to preserve a niche for the voice brokers, said Wold. ""The markets are still going to need somebody to massage the markets, and that is where the brokers come in,"" he said. Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

<6871897.1075858732063.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,Report On EPSA Legislative Affairs Committee Meeting,"The EPSA leg. affairs cmt. met today during the fall meeting. The speakers were Howard Useem, Republican counsel to the Senate Energy Committee, and Jimmy Glotfelty, senior policy advisory to the Secretary of Energy. Useem said Senate Energy Committee Republicans were meeting later this morning to finalize their energy proposal. (We later learned that they opted against including any electricity provisions, not even the PURPA, PUHCA and reliability issues that Howard thought might be included when he spoke before the senators met; this is good news since it makes it less likely that anti-FERC provisions will be added.) (Howard said now is the best time to legislative on electricity because the Supreme Court has not yet acted on the bundling/unbundling issue.) On RTOs, in some what of a surprise, Useem said that there is general support among Senate Republicans for RTOs, including consolidating them into a few RTOs of large scope (surprising since this is not what we have heard in meetings with individual Senate offices). While he said that, he also said that support is stronger in the abstract than in specifics. He said the biggest opposition was coming from very vocal state regulators (EPSA staff did a good job of pointing to state regulators, mainly in the Midwest, who support larger RTOs). Most importantly, Howard said none of the senators on his committee take a ""not over my dead body"" approach to RTOs. Jimmy Glotfelty explained to several EPSA members who asked questions just why it is that the Administration wants Congress to be silent on RTOs. He said while they would prefer a sentence or two affirming FERC's authority, they do not believe this is what would come out of the legislative process. They are not willing to run that risk. He stressed that the president wants to include other electricity issues. He said they were very close to an agreement with Western governors on regional transmission siting. Jimmy further said that the Administration also wants silence on incentive rates, another issue where FERC can act now. They continue to talk to Barton and his staff in an attempt to get them to back away from the restrictive approach to RTOs in the Barton discussion draft. (He said Pat Wood spent several hours with Barton and other House committee staff yesterday.) Of concern, Jimmy said something like ""could be 4 RTOs, could be 8 RTOs,"" what is important is getting standard design. He also said DOE will make sure that PMAs are included in RTOs.",Company Business/Strategy

Wolak"" Sent: Friday, October 19, 2001 4:28 PM To: Kaminski, Vince J Subject: Vince, I've been hearing rumors that Enron has decided to endorse the nodal pricing model as implemented in PJM. I just wanted to warn you that I'm not sure this is in Enron's long-term interest at all. Let me explain why. Feel free to give me a call if you'd like to talk more about this. First, let me say that I firmly believe in locational pricing and specifically pricing congestion. However, the way that PJM implements nodal pricing is to eliminate as much price volatility and reduce the transparency of the market. Specifically, the PJM tariff gives the ISO the ability to mitigate to cost plus a %10 adder the bids of any market participant that the ISO deems is out of merit in one of the three zones in region. (The fact that a nodal market is talking about zones should give you cause for alarm.) Then the ISO takes this mitigated bid and re-runs its price-setting software to compute new nodal prices. The way I have (somewhat unfairly) decribed this price-setting process is that the PJM ISO decides what prices it would like for a given day and mitigates bids until it gets them. This is not a transparent market, nor one where it makes any sense to buy the risk management services that Enron provides. The only price volatility you have to worry about in the PJM market is that kind that comes about if they need imports into their control area to meet demand. Under these circumstances, you need to pay the imports whatever is necessary to get them to come to your market. However, bear in mind FERC's desire to make a large RTO on the East Coast. This will effectively mean little imports to the East Coast RTO, so all bids can be mitigated at the discretion of the ISO. Paying market-clearing prices to cost-of-service mitigated bids is just paying too much to eliminate price volatility. It effectively kills off the development of risk management at the wholesale and retail level. Power marketing becomes much less profitable because retailers know you can always buy at cost-mitigated prices. In short, the PJM model is not market. It is just an alternative form of regulation that is politically attractive because it reduces price volatility, but it is not good for consumers or traders because they just get a higher cost form of regulation than traditional cost-of-service regulation. You pay market-clearing prices to cost-of-service mitigated bids, but under regulation you could just pay cost-of-service prices and eliminate the infra-marginal profits to low cost generators. As we discussed during our dinner, I think the two biggest sources of benefits from re-structuring will come from getting the demand-side involved in the market and from more efficient risk management. A necessary condition for both of these to occur is prices that reflect actual conditions in the market (including the extent of market power exercised). Masking these signals dulls any incentive for market participants to make the investment necessary to management. The PJM model is just way to have a market in name without achieving any significant benefits to consumers or energy traders. Frank",Company Business/Strategy

CC list suppressed... September 27, 2000 California Utilities' LossesOn Electricity Pose Risk By REBECCA SMITH Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL California's two biggest utilities are losing so much money buying electricity in the state's deregulated market that they have run up deficits equivalent to half their net worth in just four months. If the cost of wholesale power continues to exceed the price these utilities are allowed to bill their customers, as currently seems likely, they could become technically insolvent sometime next year. That would put pressure on regulators to orchestrate a multibillion-dollar public bailout, similar to the ""too big to fail'' response that in the past pushed governments to rescue banks. Such a scenario is quietly being discussed by bond-rating concerns that recently reduced their credit outlooks for Pacific Gas & Electric Co., a unit of San Francisco-based PG&E Corp., and Southern California Edison, a unit of Edison International of Rosemead, Calif. Bond- rating concerns say they aren't sure how much additional debt can be borne by the two affected utilities before they will have difficulty paying their bills. Probe of California Power Prices Begins, but New Plants Aren't Seen as Solution (Sept. 11) Los Angeles Utility Is Benefitting, Surprisingly, From Deregulation (Sept. 6) California Lawmakers Vote to Limit Electricity Costs (Sept. 1) ""If this is just a seasonal aberration, the utilities can get through it,"" says Lori Woodland, analyst for Fitch IBCA. ""If it goes on for six or nine months, it's a very serious situation."" Adds A.J. Sabatelle, senior credit officer at Moody's Investors Service Inc.: ""At some point, you have a financial crisis."" The utilities say they are having no difficulty meeting expenses and don't envision problems in servicing their debts. But they are vigorously lobbying state and federal regulators to change the rules of the game, hoping somehow to raise rates to make up for the shortfall. The California utilities' experience may be a harbinger of what could happen in other states where wholesale power prices have surpassed the amount that utilities are allowed to charge their ratepayers. For now, utilities are making ends meet by going to the financial markets to borrow money. PG&E, a giant utility that serves one out of every 20 Americans, is seeking approval to increase its debt capacity by $1.4 billion. It is borrowing $200 million, while Edison is tapping $250 million from the commercial paper market. ""This is going to be a long, tough road,"" says Jim Scilacci, chief financial officer for Southern California Edison. Today's situation represents a complete turnabout from what was expected when California deregulated its energy market on March 31, 1998, which opened electricity pricing to competition. California tried to give its utilities a competitive edge nationally by deregulating faster than other states and by creating a mechanism to allow investor-owned utilities, such as PG&E and Edison, to quickly pay down debts incurred to serve customers under the old regulatory system. To do this, the state legislature set retail rates at high levels, which, at first, generated fat surpluses for the utilities. As the money piled up, utilities used it to pay down debts for generation facilities that were otherwise unprofitable in the new deregulated world. By the end of this June, PG&E and Edison together had collected more than $12 billion and were on track to finish paying down debts well ahead of the March 31, 2002, deadline set by the legislature. At that point, rate freezes were to end and retail prices were to fluctuate with the market. But all that went out the window in June, when wholesale power prices surged, topping the rates the utilities were allowed to charge retail customers. Average prices at state-sanctioned energy markets were four to five times the prices of a year earlier, and three to four times the level utilities could charge customers. The accumulated shortfall has been so enormous at PG&E, that analysts expect its deficit to exceed $3 billion by Oct. 31, more than half its shareholder equity of $5.7 billion, which is defined as assets minus liabilities. Southern California Edison finished August with a deficit of $2 billion, equivalent to almost two-thirds its net worth of $3.2 billion. The utilities, though they have been accumulating deficits, aren't required to report these as losses on their earnings statements. That leaves utilities in a bind. They want to end the rate freeze to be able to pass on the real cost of electricity to consumers. But should the freeze end before the statutory deadline of 2002, they get clobbered. That is because they will immediately have to book a loss on their power-purchase deficits. What's more, they can't use the proceeds from planned power-plant sales to cover those losses; instead, should the freeze end, they will be obliged to refund some of the proceeds to ratepayers. In PG&E's case, the refunds could total $500 million, while in Edison's case, the amount is $254 million. Publicly at least, utility executives insist a mechanism will be found to let them recoup the money spent on electricity. Consumer advocates are gearing up for the fight. Nettie Hoge, executive director for San Francisco consumer group Utility Reform Network, says ratepayers shouldn't end up footing the bill for a deal cut by utilities that benefited them before prices shot up. Utility executives are now distancing themselves from the legislation that got them into such a mess, which was drafted with their assistance. PG&E Chairman Robert Glynn says it is best not to ""overanalyze"" the ""old deal."" Instead, he says, regulators and legislators should sit down with utilities and construct a new agreement, since ""it's in the broad interests of the state not to have critical energy infrastructure look like a leper."" Mr. Glynn says the current deal offers ""mutually assured destruction"" to both utilities and ratepayers. Something must be done, he says, or consumers throughout most of the state will experience ""a San Diego-style rate shock."" The utility serving that city, San Diego Gas & Electric Co., ended its freeze a year ago and began passing wholesale power costs directly through to ratepayers. Legislators intervened this summer, however, and temporarily capped retail rates when monthly power bills nearly tripled. The utility, a unit of Sempra Energy, is also accumulating a deficit as a result. So long as banks and bond markets believe the utilities will be repaid, they will be able to borrow, analysts say. ""Until we hear politicians of consequence state otherwise, our position is that we believe the utilities will be made whole,"" says Richard Cortright, a director at Standard & Poor's corporate ratings group. But that opinion could change if it looks like the utilities will have to swallow a big loss. The result: lower credit ratings that would raise borrowing costs and could trigger a downward spiral. ""You're talking about top-rated companies, though,"" said Ms. Woodland of Fitch IBCA. ""To get to insolvency, a lot would have to happen."" In the meantime, utilities are doing all they can to control the hemorrhaging. They have gotten authority from regulators to buy more power under long-term contracts at fixed prices, reducing their vulnerability to spot-market volatility. And they have petitioned federal regulators to declare California's market so badly flawed that generators should be denied market pricing and, even, ordered to pay refunds. Nevertheless, several forces are working against them. Although they can sign bilateral contracts, prices remain high for those as well. What's more, they can't buy less power than their customers need. If they don't buy enough, the California Independent System Operator, the organization responsible for reliability, will step in and make purchases for them and send them the bill. Perhaps the biggest problem facing PG&E and Edison, though, is one of timing. The California legislature is out of session until December, and regulators haven't even really started to address the issue formally. In the meantime, the utilities' deficit is growing by tens of millions of dollars daily. Write to Rebecca Smith at rebecca.smith@wsj.com",Company Business/Strategy

Would also send it to those who have refused to go and other key contacts we have given to you. Media seems to be keen to know EFET's position on this.

So we can expect the first articles on California tomorrow or latest on Monday. I also will do an additional internet monitoring (for example WAZ, which we don't read daily) this afternoon to see if there are already some articles.

Mr Lay's letter will serve as an introduction to Jeff Skilling, and will also permit Enron Japan to follow up directly with Mr Okuda's staff in Japan. We can then draft a letter for Jeff Skilling to confirm arrangements. I attach a draft letter for that purpose.

 ege and Work Product","While I appreciate the virtue of flying below the radar if possible, the matter here is complicated by the fact that FERC's discovery rules (18 CFR, Subpart D) pertain only to ""proceedings set for hearing . . . and to such proceedings as the Commission may order."" 18 CFR 385.401. In this case, FERC stated that ""a trial-type hearing is not necessary . . . ."" and specifically rejected the use of a ""trial-type evidentiary hearing."" Slip op. at 47-48 & n.97. Thus, while I have not researched the matter as yet, my preliminary view is that the CPUC's attempt to invoke FERC's discovery processes would appear to be outside the contemplation of FERC's Nov. 1 order and its regulations, unless FERC specifically orders discovery in this case. (The CPUC seems to recognize the relevance of this consideration when it specifically attempts to equate ""paper"" hearings with ""trial-type"" hearings; see page 1 of its Motion.) The CPUC's motion may prompt FERC to decide whether or not to allow discovery in this case under Rule 401. While the CPUC's motion does not apply directly to marketers, FERC's ruling will be precedent in the event the CPUC or someone else hereafter serves discovery on other parties. As a result, we need to consider whether laying in the weeds risks losing an opportunity to present our views on whether FERC should allow discovery in a paper hearing with an expedited decisional track, particularly in light of the fact that Staff has already conducted. >>> Jeffrey Watkiss 11/08/00 10:31AM >>> Does anyone have an idea as to why marketers, including EPMI, are not included in the list of subject companies: Exh.

According to Exhibit B (read to me by Nancy Pickover at Bracewell) the following CPUC moved against the following entities: AES, Williams, Duke, Dynegy, Reliant and Southern. Enron entities were NOT named in exhibit B. This is not to say that we could not be easily added to the group. While the motion reads as if the CPUC was moving against everybody, in fact, in footnote 2 they state they are only moving against the entities named in Exhibit B.

They request that we be required: to answer their motion on Thursday, to provide the information within 5 working days of a FERC ordering production, and to provide of P&L information and spread sheets detailing our deals, specifically delivery point, delivery date, counterparty, volume and price. We may not have a problem providing this information for use by FERC in its proceeding subject to a confidentiality agreement but I think we would oppose their requests for: the information to be provided for ""government eyes only"" - this would prohibit EPMI from defending itself vis-a-vis other market participants. a FERC confidentiality order that would could allow FERC to ""share"" this information with the CPUC (for purposes of the PUC's OII proceeding) pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 824h(c). 16 USC 824g(c) requires the Commission to make information available to state commissions as may be of assistance in state regulation of public utilities. We should argue that 16 USC 824h(c) does not apply here given that we are not a public utility nor does the PUC regulate how much market power wholesale marketers exercise or the level of market power mitigation (these are the bases the PUC provides for explaining why it should have this information.) the above contractual information to allow them to analyze the competitiveness of the forward market to evaluate the wisdom of the Commission's decision to allow the UDC's ""unfettered access"" to the forwards market.

Margaret/Cindy -- how does the link work? does it go straight to the clip or do users have to navigate within CNN's site? ---------------------- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/HOU/EES on 08/01/2000 07:42 AM --------------------------- Cindy Derecskey@ENRON 07/31/2000 04:58 PM To: Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES cc: Maureen McVicker/HOU/EES@EES Subject: CNN Link Update Steve, I spoke with Margaret and she mentioned she also takes the same route as I've started, to obtain the electronic link for CNN stories/profiles of Enron. Although, the contract looks like it only allows us Intranet use and not Internet use as well. This premise was confirmed by Margaret too, because she recalls paying $2,000.00 for a Intranet/Internet video link, and only $500.00 for a Intranet link. My unsolicited recommendation would be to purchase the external link as well as the internal link. I believe we would get a lot of mileage out of posting this link on our website - with downloadable supporting software - to allow users to view the video. From a PR perspective, I would refer 90% of incoming inquiries to our site, as well as sending them general company info. Also, it would unequivocally illustrate and promote why Enron's has been voted 'Most Innovative Company' for five consecutive years in a row. Now...enough of my blabber and to the point...I am still waiting to hear back from CNN to assess exact pricing for both types of links. I've placed two follow-up calls but have not yet heard anything. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to inquire with me. Regards, Cindy",Company Business/Strategy

Present were ESPs, consumer groups, business interests, the utlities and representatives from the Department of Finance, the DWR and Finance's Bond Counsel. The meeting was led by Laurence Lingbloom from Senator bowen's office. Aaron Thomas led off with an articualtion of the AReM/business coalition proposal. Successive presentations were given by interests who submitted either correspondence or draft proposals- the details of which can be discussed in tomorrow's conference call. Of particular note, and the greatest obstacle facing the future of da, was the presentation by the attorney representing the Dept. of Finance. He expressed concern over broad exemptions from exit fees (ie: all residential and small commercial customers < 100kw) and broad authority to opt out will make it extremely difficult to actually sell the bonds. We need to follow up with Finance, their counsel and DWR to allay their fears- the sooner the better. We need to be able to speak their language on bonding particulars and we need to be able to articulate our position in terms relavant to their bonding requirements. We can discuss this further in the call tomorow. Finally, Lingbloom said he will circulate a proposal of his own by midweek next. The general tenor at the conclusion of the meeting was not good- we have our work cut out for us. Until tomorrow. Norm",Company Business/Strategy

We could agree to enter into a Consulting Services Agreement with Kevin. The terms of that Agreement would include: 1. He agrees to be available and cooperative with Enron and its counsel regarding litigation matters. He will agree to meet with counsel, prepare for testimony, review documents, testify, and provide other assistance, as needed. 2. Through February 1, 2001, Kevin would not be directly compensated for this cooperation/testimony (because he is to be receiving his salary pursuant to the terms of his employment agreement). After Feb.1, 2001, he will be paid a rate of $125 per hour for his services in this regard. 3. Enron would agree to indemnify Kevin for his conduct taken in the ordinary course and scope of his employment with Enron, up to the last date of his employment with Enron. Excluded from this indemnity would be allegations or claims based upon the following: -- any conduct that is outside the course and scope of Kevin's employment, -- any conduct violating policies of Enron or ENA, -- Kevin's intentional acts, -- Kevin's gross negligence, -- Kevin's reckless conduct, -- conduct that is in violation of any law, statute, regulation, or other legal obligation, or -- the commission of an unlawful or illegal act. 4. Kevin would invoice Enron for time spent in performing the services after 2/1/01. The invoice would be paid within 30 days of receipt. In addition, all related expenses would be reimbursed throughout the term of the agreement. Let me know if you have any questions or require additional information.

<25447472.1075856582182.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,Security question,"Dear guys Having been out of the office for a couple of days, I've found myself the victim of theft (again). This time my desk drawer key has been stolen from its ""hiding place"" under my telephone. I *always* lock my drawers and keep the key in the same place, but on arriving in the office today I found the drawers unlocked, and the key missing. Although there's nothing sensitive on or around my desk, I'm concerned about the security implications of someone sniffing around the office in this manner. I also found the papers on my desk extensively reshuffled last week. Last year, in our old office, I had my only two real options books stolen from among the many and varied books on my desk. That couldn't have been a random theft, and I fear this isn't either. I can't understand who'd be so interested in a Research guy's belongings! Can we ask security to check their surveillance footage for any suspicious activity around my desk? Cheers, Steve",Personal but in professional context

As you know, the Energy and Commerce Committee recently=20 considered legislation containing several targeted measures to assist=20 California in resolving its energy supply crisis.? One of these measures wa= s=20 a temporary =01&safe harbor=018 provision, effective only upon the Californ= ia=20 Governor=01,s request, to protect critical extended emergency operation of= =20 powerplants from challenges under the Clean Air Act.=20 ??????????? During the course of six hearings the Subcommittee on Energy an= d=20 Air Quality held on the California electric crisis, including two hearings = on=20 draft legislation, Members of the Committee repeatedly told California=20 officials that these plants were vulnerable to legal challenge, even with= =20 written =01&agreements=018 for extended operation between state air officia= ls and=20 the powerplants.? Nevertheless, California officials testifying or providin= g=20 information on behalf of your state and your citizens claimed that such a= =20 safe harbor was not necessary.=20 ??????????? I fear events have proven that on this important matter, the=20 concerns expressed by Members of our Committee were valid and that our=20 interpretation of the legal jeopardy faced by California was accurate.? On= =20 June 19th, several community groups filed a lawsuit in federal court agains= t=20 three electric generating units in California (all located at the Potrero= =20 power plant site) alleging multiple violations of the Clean Air Act for=20 emergency extended operation.? On the same day, the City and County of San= =20 Francisco filed formal notice that it would also pursue legal action agains= t=20 the three Potrero units.? All parties involved in the litigation strongly= =20 assert that the extended operation agreement between state air officials an= d=20 the Potrero power plant does nothing to prevent them from pursuing all=20 available legal remedies under federal and state law.=20 ??????????? The legal action against the units located at the Potrero power= =20 plant claims that extended operation violates limits contained in federal a= ir=20 permits and seeks fines potentially amounting to millions of dollars.?=20 Understandably, as a result of this potentially huge fine, the operator of= =20 the Potrero power plant has filed a motion with the Federal Energy Regulato= ry=20 Commission to clarify that it will not be required to operate the three=20 generating units, even during periods of electrical emergency.? Thus, the= =20 mere filing of this lawsuit could have a near-term impact of the amount of= =20 power available in California.=20 ??????????? Perhaps even more troubling is our understanding that substanti= al=20 amounts of electric power produced by peaking plants and other facilities i= n=20 California could also be subject to similar legal action.? The California= =20 Independent System Operator lists 31 units representing 1,430 megawatts of= =20 peaking units which are subject to legal limits on their total hours of=20 operation.? In addition, several new units are being brought on-line this= =20 summer without required Clean Air Act control equipment.? According to=20 incomplete information we received from the California Air Resources Board= =20 (CARB), 37 generating units have been identified in California which may=20 exhaust allowable annual operating hours contained in their air permits pri= or=20 to this summer=01,s peak demand period.? These units may represent up to 2%= of=20 generation, approximately the critical operating reserve shortfall of a Sta= ge=20 III electric emergency.=20 ??????????? Although presented with written requests for information from t= he=20 Committee on April 2, 2001, CARB could not or would not provide the Committ= ee=20 with precise information on units that may have been off-line due to permit= =20 limits, a projection of the number of generating units that will face permi= t=20 constraints that could cause such units to be off-line, the amount of=20 generation associated with these facilities, the possible impact of these= =20 units on system reliability, and additional information related to air=20 emissions from facilities that will be operating under =01&modified=018=20 conditions.?? We believe that in the face of the pending legal action, it i= s=20 even more important that such information be accurately and objectively=20 determined.=20 ??????????? As we mentioned above, over several months in the spring and=20 early summer of this year, the Committee sought California=01,s support of = an=20 extremely narrow safe harbor provision to protect the extended operation of= =20 certain powerplants.? Regrettably, the Committee did not receive any suppor= t=20 from your administration for such changes to the law, as represented by the= =20 testimony and responses attached to this letter.? Instead, witnesses=20 representing California claimed such a legal safe harbor for emergency=20 generation was unnecessary -- even if it could only be granted during perio= ds=20 of emergency and upon your personal request to the Environmental Protection= =20 Agency (EPA).?=20 ??????????? It appears now that citizen groups in California -- as well as= =20 the City and County of San Francisco -- do not believe that the actions tak= en=20 by you, your state agencies and local air quality districts are legal.? The= =20 pending litigation challenges the very agreements which California previous= ly=20 claimed granted sufficient legal =01&flexibility=018 to keep these units ru= nning=20 during times of emergency.? It is time, then, to reconsider this issue.=20 ??????????? So that the Committee may understand the extent of this critica= l=20 situation and respond accordingly, we would ask for your consideration of t= he=20 following:=20 (1) We would urge you to reply fully to the Committee=01,s earlier requests= that=20 CARB specifically identify each generating unit and power plant that is in= =20 jeopardy of exceeding limitations contained in the Clean Air Act and thus= =20 potentially subject to the citizen suit provisions of the Act.?

<22747723.1075858707662.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,Bingaman Draft On Transparency -- Amendment Ideas,"Last night, Linda and I spent a fairly long time with Leon Lowery, Chairman Bingaman's chief electricity advisor, to discuss our concerns with the transparency and market-based rate language -- while at the same time commending the transmission access language in the draft and strategizing how to support the chairman in that regard. We made progress on transparency, less so on market-based rates. On transparency, Leon understands our concerns. In a nutshell, he seemed amenable to amending the langauge to avoid the result of having to divulge transaction-specific, trade-specific information. We persuaded Leon that was the impact of the initial language, although he initially said details would be left to FERC. We persuaded him that if any data is to be provided, it MUST be only in aggregate form. We also impressed on him that if, as he said, the intent is to leave details to FERC -- then more of the details should be left to FERC, not set by statute. Leon strongly advised that we seek to craft language consistent with the above exchange that makes as few changes to the draft as needed to make the necessary corrections. This will make it easier for Leon to navigate the internal waters of the staff. (Sam Fowler, th chief counsel, is a drafting stickler). Others should obviously weigh in and review this, but to facilitate internal comments (we need to get back to Leon today), here is my take on what he has in mind. Under new sec. 218(b) (to be added to the FPA by bill sec. 413) (pg. 13), under ""information required"" we would rewrite paragraph 2 as follows: (2) each broker, exchange, or other market-making entity that matches offers to sell and offers to buy wholesale electric energy in interstate commerce to provide aggregate statistical information about its sales of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce. The effect of the language change is drop the reference to sale prices of each sale of electric energy. By leaving it as aggregate statistical information, this should give FERC maximum flexibility to permit indexes, etc. As to the ""timely basis"" of information release (subsection (c)), the alternatives sent yesterday would require this to be done on the Internet after the end of the trading day. If we can restrict this to aggregate data, question arises whether we want to concede that this would be done daily. That suggests the data to be collected would be more than we would want, I think. Here is a take on how we might suggest a revision to that language to give FERC more leeway: ""(c) TIMELY BASIS -- The Commission shall require the information required under subsection (b) to be posted on the Internet and updated as frequently as practicable and appropriate. The change is to add ""appropriate"" so that FERC can consider other than whether posting is practicable. The use of ""appropriate"" is what came to mind -- perhaps there is some other word or phrase like ""consistent with ..."" or ""promote competition"" or some way of saying there are policy considerations other than practicability. There should be some valid purpose established before data is released. I would argue that the (d) language on commercially sensitive information goes only to exempting from disclosure, not when disclosure is appropriate. Please let me have your thoughts, although the tragedy in NYC and DC now underway will probably make this not a day to transact such business on the Hill. Will provide a further report on market-based rates. In sum, Leon was not as sympathetic on this issue, but asked for our ideas and further arguments. We sense Leon personally feels strongly about moving the FPA to some linkage to competitive markets. His argument is that market participants can be doing everything by the book and the result can still be uncompetitive markets. We pushed that penalizing us is not the answer -- nor is increasing regulatory uncertainty about deals doing to help keep prices down. Leon clearly does not intend this language to punish Enron -- but others who we might all agree have done things that are not in keeping with competitive markets.",Document editing/checking/collaboration

I attended a meeting this afternoon of the Coalition of Service Industries, one of the lead groups promoting a wide range of services including energy services in the upcoming WTO GATTS 2000 negotiations. CSI President Bob Vastine was in Delhi last week and met with CII to discuss the upcoming WTO. CII apparently has a committee looking into the WTO. Bob says that he told them that energy services was among the CSI recommendations and he recalls that CII said that they too have an interest. Since returning from the meeting I spoke with Kiran Pastricha and told her the above. She actually arranged the meeting in Delhi. She asked that I send her the packet of materials we distributed last week in Brussels and London. One of her associates is leaving for India tomorrow and will take one of these items to Delhi. Joe Joe Hillings 09/08/99 11:57 AM To: Sanjay cc: Terence H Ashok John Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES, Jeffrey Sherrick/Corp/Enron@Enron (bcc: Joe Hillings/Corp/Enron) Subject: India And The WTO Services Negotiation Sanjay: First some information and then a request for your advice and involvment. A group of US companies and associations formed the US WTO Energy Services Coalition in late May and has asked the US Government to include ""energy services"" on their proposed agenda when the first meeting of the WTO GATTS 2000 ministerial convenes late this year in Seattle. Ken Lay will be among the CEO speakers. These negotiations are expected to last three years and cover a range of subjects including agriculture, textiles, e-commerce, investment, etc. This morning I visited with Sudaker Rao at the Indian Embassy to tell him about our coalition and to seek his advice on possible interest of the GOI. After all, India is a leader in data processing matters and has other companies including ONGC that must be interested in exporting energy services. In fact probably Enron and other US companies may be engaging them in India and possibly abroad. Sudaker told me that the GOI has gone through various phases of opposing the services round to saying only agriculture to now who knows what. He agrees with the strategy of our US WTO Energy Services Coalition to work with companies and associations in asking them to contact their government to ask that energy services be on their list of agenda items. It would seem to me that India has such an interest. Sudaker and I agree that you are a key person to advise us and possibly to suggest to CII or others that they make such a pitch to the GOI Minister of Commerce. I will ask Lora to send you the packet of materials Chris Long and I distributed in Brussels and London last week. I gave these materials to Sudaker today. Everyone tells us that we need some developing countries with an interest in this issue. They may not know what we are doing and that they are likely to have an opportunity if energy services are ultimately negotiated. Please review and advise us how we should proceed. We do need to get something done in October. Joe PS Terry Thorn is moderating a panel on energy services at the upcoming World Services Congress in Atlanta. The Congress will cover many services issues. I have noted in their materials that Mr. Alliwalia is among the speakers but not on energy services. They expect people from all over the world to participate.",Empty message

Additionally, I outlined the discussion points/action items from this morning's meeting you held with Jennifer Medcalf and myself. Per your request, the HP presentation complete with a listing of HP's business partners was e-mailed to you this morning. HP contacts to date: Bill Lovejoy, Western Gulf Area Sales Manager Houston, TX #(713)-439-5587 (Gerry Cashiola's boss) Gerry Cashiola, sales representative Houston, TX #(713)-439-5555 (To date, HP person coordinating the relationship--seeking a short term play) Greg Pyle, Solution Control Manager Southeast Region Austin, TX (#(512)-257-5735 (Pyle has been playing the business developer role but continues to defer leadership of the process to Gerry Cashiola) Daniel Morgridge, Manager of Internet - E-Services long term alliances Austin, TX #(512)-257-5736 (Interested in E-services/wireless longer term alliances) Bill Dwyer, Chief Architect, e-Services Solutions Cupertino, CA #(408)-447-5240 (To date, clearly the most knowledgeable person on HP's business propositions; strong technical, financial background to craft value propositions. Gerry Cashiola and Greg Pyle deferred to his judgement in the 11/16th meeting) Matt, On November 10th, GSS Business Development took HP through a tour of Enron's trading floor, the gas control center, and the peaking power plant unit center on the trading floor. This tour was one meeting, amongst several, held in October and November to provide HP a full overview of Enron's products and services and introduce them to appropriate contacts at Enron (EBS, GSS buy side -- Peter Goebel). On November 16th GSS Business Development, Patrick Tucker, and Dale Clark outlined 3 possible EBS/HP focus areas -- connectivity, storage, and wireless. Three EBS action items were defined in that meeting: 1) HP was to provide an HP contact on connectivity (to date, Gerry Cashiola has stalled on providing this). Sarah-Joy will continue to pursue this information and get a sense from Gerry Cashiola of what he means by short term opportunity. What is HP's time horizon for short term? 2) EBS and GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call on Storage with Ravi to explore size and potential scope of opportunity (completed 12/8) 3) GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call with Peter Goebel, GSS IT Sourcing Portfolio Leader (set for 12/14) In conversations with you, Jennifer Medcalf and myself this morning, several decisions on forward-looking strategy with HP/EBS were confirmed: Gerry Cashiola has been unable to take control of the process. More importantly, despite numerous visits to Enron in which he has had overviews of Enron's products and services; met with Peter Goebel and his team on the GSS buy side, and participated in an Experience Enron tour, Gerry has been unable to define an HP business proposition. The coordination between Cashiola (short term initiative) Morgridge (long term, 12-24 months) has remained unorganized. These initiatives need to be developed separately. Clearly, the conversations with HP need to be elevated to a more senior level so EBS can work with HP decision makers who can move the relationship forward at a strategic level. As the relationship is developed at this strategic level, shorter term opportunities will crop up along the way. But Gerry's short term plans will not be the focus of the EBS/HP relationship, rather a by-product. To facilitate this process of elevating the relationship, Jennifer Medcalf and I are following up with Bill Lovejoy and Greg Pyle. Lovejoy's boss is Dan Sytsma, VP of HP's America's Central Region. In the conference call Thursday, 12/14 with Peter Goebel and HP regarding wireless initiatives, Peter will support the GSS/BD push for the HP/EBS initiative by reiterating the following two points: a) Enron is already an HP customer; the onus is on HP to move forward on the process of building a strategic relationship (IBM and Lexmark are only some of the HP competitors who could push them out of the running) b) HP's ability to bring the right people to the table will influence HP's business relationship process with Enron Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark could build their relationship with Bill Dwyer, Chief Architect e-Services Solutions, (met at the meeting 11/16) in the near term. Perhaps, plan a visit to Cupertino, California to see Dwyer in person. We look forward to continuing close collaboration with your team on this and other opportunities.

It states that rich countries on average have relatively low entry costs while poor countries have stagering entry costs caused by corruption, endless beuacracy, and cost of delays. These ""entry hurdles"" and asscoiated costs do not produce any tangible benefits for consumers, workers or the environment. We might want to make the analogy of ""entry tax"" for new deregulated gas & power markets. Things like negotiated third-party access (rather than regulated TPA) substantially slow the speed of new entrants and hence deter competition. Negotiated TPA creates uncertainty for new entrants (they never know what they are going to get) and clearly slows the new comers down. I will send you a copy of the Forbes piece.

<17929939.1075860276062.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Protecting Confidential Information: New European Restricted List
 Procedure","As you know, we are now launching EnronCredit.com which will involve credit derivatives trading in Europe and North America, both on Enron Online and off-line. This will involve quoting prices for buying and selling bankruptcy protection in respect of reference entities, many of whom are our counterparties in a variety of different commercial and financial contexts. This exciting cocktail of credit derivatives and Enron Online raises significant novel legal risks for Enron. Probably the most significant risk would arise in a situation where Enron has confidential information about a reference entity and wrongfully uses that information in pricing the credit derivative on that entity. This could well result in legal proceeding against Enron. In practice, an allegation of misuse of confidential information can be very difficult indeed to defend without adequate procedures in place to safeguard that information. In fact, Enron's credit trading will rely strictly on publicly available financial information and will not involve the use of confidential information, unless the reference entity has specifically consented. Nevertheless, to avoid the appearance of impropriety, we are taking additional steps to consider confidentiality agreements we have in place with potential reference entities before deciding whether or not we will quote prices on such entities. Against this background is the ever-present risk of ""insider dealing"". This crime - which carries a maximum prison sentence of 7 years and an unlimited fine - is committed where a person (or member of their family etc) deals in the securities (shares, bonds or derivatives on them) of a listed company on the basis of unpublished (confidential) price-sensitive information. We do not expect at this time to deal in publicly traded bonds as part of EnronCredit.com, but insider dealing is relevant to the conduct of Enron staff and could affect other parts of our business. In addition, SFA rules require the safeguarding of confidential information, the misuse of which is a serious disciplinary matter. In order to ensure the success of this new business and that confidential information is not misused either by Enron or its staff, we are now introducing new policies and procedures (attached) which include a simple Restricted List procedure. In essence they require you - to take prudent steps to safeguard confidential information within Enron to notify Michael Brown, Mark Elliott or myself if you become aware of confidential or sensitive information (or circumstances) about a counterparty which you think might make it appropriate for that counterparty to be placed on the Restricted List. To make life easier, numerous examples of the types of information which might be relevant are set out in the attached procedures. Please familiarise yourself, and anyone else in your group you think appropriate, with these procedures. As you will see, you are not expected to make difficult determinations about whether an entity should or should not be added to the Restricted List, just to let us know if you think there is a possibility that it should be added. We will also provide quick briefing sessions to ensure that each of you is comfortable with these new procedures. Many thanks for your co-operation.",Company Business/Strategy

The second paragraph and the first few bullets after it should be rewritten as follows to make it clear that the current legislative proposal on RTOs is far off the mark as opposed to being fixed by ""technical corrections"" as the draft letter now states: You have identified RTOs as critical to the development of a well-functioning transmission system, and we wholeheartedly agree. We commend you for including all transmission-owning utilities in the RTO provisions and for requiring that transmission be conducted on an open-access basis. However, to accomplish the RTO and transmission goals we share, it is essential that any legislation on RTOs not slow down the process already underway at FERC. Unfortunately, the discussion draft as issued on October 9th does not meet this test. Specifically, the proposal Establishes a lengthy and cumbersome process that will delay the formation of RTOs by imposing procedural requirements that advantage those who oppose properly functioning RTOs, including evidentiary hearings and court appeals review under standards of judicial review not normally applicable to Federal Power Act cases. Removes the ability of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to deal with an evolving marketplace by statutorily freezing market and operational structures in place as of date of enactment regardless of changed circumstances. [rest of the bullets as in the draft letter] We appreciate the opportunity to offer these suggestions to strengthen the draft letter.

Thus, please consult with me prior to entering into any solicitation, agreement or arrangement which might arguably be covered by our limited covenant not to compete on the supply side for 3 months. There are many aspects of the post-close transition which will require cooperation between Enron and AEP/HPL and thus, it behoves us to carefully weigh the risks and rewards of ""stepping too close to or over the line"".

<18858384.1075855431020.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"Status of Discussions on Electricity Legislation -- No Agreement
 Reached","Once again today I participated in the discussions on possible electricity legislation held in the offices of Majority Whip Tom DeLay with other interested parties including industry segments, public power and state regulators. The other congressional participants were staff to Reps. Steve Largent and Chip Pickering. After meeting all week (except Wednesday), the group was unable to reach an agreement or even a provisional consensus on what could be placed in an electricity title that could be added to the comprehensive energy package that the House Energy and Commerce Committee will begin to process next week. Congressional staff will report to their bosses on the status of the discussions as of this afternoon and from there the Members will determine whether to proceed further. There is a general perception that committee leaders will elect NOT to take up electricty legislation at this time and in the context of the broader package in the absence of broadly supported legislation. In the end, the discussions did not bear fruit because divisions remained over the usual issues and along most of the usual fault lines. As the drafts progressed during the week, we succeeded in deleting the original language that would have had Congress weigh into the bundled/unbundled and federa/state jurisdictional rules at the very time that likely adverse action in Congress could in turn adversely impact the Supreme Court case. A last minute attempt was made by the congressional staff to stitch together a minimalist electricity title that would have included reliability (with the understanding that the NERC discussions could produce modifications more to our liking), PUHCA repeal, PURPA reform, interconnection language and federal siting. However, in each instance there were one more politically relevant interest groups not willing to go along. Cong. DeLay's staff also tried to link PUHCA repeal to those who had joined an RTO. There was also an attempt to strip it down to reliability, interconnection and siting (eminent domain) -- but again there was either disagreement on the details or objection from those who favorite subject was left out of the minimalist package. There was one rather interesting discussion when the public power folks floated language on market power that included a sentence that would have made the filed rate doctrine inapplicable to antitrust challenges to market rates. Needless to say, I strongly objected as did EPSA and others. As noted, the lack of an agreement reduces our exposure when the mark up occurs.

From: John Hardy@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on 05/10/2001 09:48 AM To: Rebecca McDonald/Enron@EnronXGate cc: Ben Glisan@ECT, Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron, Rob Walls/ENRON@enronXgate Subject: USG overtures on Dabhol Rebecca At a meeting yesterday at OPIC on Trakya, another of our problem projects, Dabhol was raised. A representative from the White House transition team joined the conversation. I was asked the terms under which we were prepared to negotiate and I told them at a minimum upon a commitment by the Indian authorities to serious negotiations which would include full compliance with the terms of the contracts and progress in the reform of the MSEB. I made clear that we do not see the Godbole Committee as the basis for such a discussion. I think the USG wants to be on record politically encouraging the Indian Govt. to engage in discussions all parties consider to be meaningful in hopes of working things out before it is too late, even while through OPIC and EXIM it is supporting the move towards PNT. The administration may be concerned that without such a diplomatic overture on its part it could be concluded that the USG has politically taken a position on the project. In Trakya, for example, the USG has been quite proactive in pressing the Turkish govt on the payments issue and even in discussing the payment concerns with the IMF so that the payments issues for the BOTs (two of the four in Turkey are US sponsored) are taken into account as the IMF program moves forward. So I anticipate that the USG will shortly be meeting with the Indian ambassador here and the US Charge in Delhiwill likely be directed to make the rounds and meet with senior government officals on the project. I wanted you to be aware of this; also any guidance you can provide would be helpful. Thanks John",Personal but in professional context

 Kyoto","I think Jeff should be the point person on putting the response together on this (and future air and climate change position inquiries). Jeff - please make sure you get the comments of all involved. Jeffrey Keeler 04/17/2001 05:02 PM To: Michael Terraso/OTS/Enron@ENRON, Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron, Kelly Kimberly/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Lauren Iannarone/NY/ECT@ECT, Catherine McKalip-Thompson/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Lisa Jacobson/ENRON@enronXgate, Mark Palmer/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Subject: Re: Greenpeace letters to Enron Europe concerning our position on Kyoto All: I would like to discuss how we might respond to this letter from Greenpeace, if at all. The letter is attached way at the bottom of this e-mail, and was received in several Enron European offices as a copy of what was sent to Jeff Skilling and other CEOs of major companies. I have not confirmed our receipt of such a letter from any of you, but am assuming it was delivered. I think we could respond in a very positive, constructive manner to Greenpeace, based on the statements we've already documented and the strategies we are developing. Lisa Jacobson and I are currently working on developing some tighter climate change and clean air ""messages"" that we can use in multiple areas ASAP -- upcoming Ken Lay speeches and interactions with the Administration, revising the Statement for the 2001 Corporate Responsibility Report, Enron Business articles and other internal uses, responses to environmental group inquiries and shareholder meeting Q&A, and use in everyday speeches and advocacy work. The Greenpeace questions are tricky, and set up no-win answers for the most part. I doubt they will get any direct answers to questions like: ""Does your company support President Bush in his opposition to the protocol?"" In my opinion, we can respond to Greenpeace without directly responding to these types of questions. Addressing Kyoto directly is a slippery slope -- its best to stick with the solution-oriented approach we've always taken. For this reason, I was a bit concerned to see in the e-mail chain below a characterization of Mark Palmer's statement on Kyoto (given to Jackie Gentile in London) -- ""Enron has always taken the view that the Kyoto protocol was not a workable solution to dealing with CO2 emissions. However it is not the principles behind Kyoto that we take issue with, rather it is the vehicle that has been devised to deliver the results."" I believe it is dangerous to make such statements for a number of reasons -- Greenpeace would absolutely beat us over the head with it, Friends of the Earth could step up its shareholder initiatives, etc. Also, this sets you up for a number of follow up questions that I don't think we have answers to, like: What about Kyoto is not workable? What would make it workable and would we help make it workable? If not Kyoto, what is Enron's preferred ""vehicle?"" I'd really rather stay with a constructive, solution-oriented approach and avoid reference to Kyoto altogether. I will talk with Kate Bauer in Enron Europe about this, but I think we need to decide on a global, corporate-wide response to Greenpeace. I would be happy to set up a quick conference call on the subject, or just field comments by e-mail -- whatever works best. Thoughts?

Several of our offices (Spain, Belgium, Netherlands) have received a local language version of the letter originally sent to Jeff Skilling, and other CEOs, on 5 April 2001. The email chain below gives an indication of what is in circulation. Greenpeace is expecting a response within the next week. Jackie Gentle has made me the point of contact in the PR department for this issue. We have discussed this issue briefly and we would support issuing an initial statement to acknowledge receipt of the letters, perhaps followed by a standardised, corporate- approved letter, but would like to ensure our approach is supported, and consistent with any actions, by Corporate. As some of the countries in which we operate have tangible ""green"" focused projects e.g. we have acquired a wind project in The Netherlands, it may be appropriate to allow such countries to personalise their response in local language. If we follow up an initial acknowledgement with a fuller response to Greenpeace's questions, I suggest we consider the following issues raised recently by Jackie Gentle: ""In response to several requests for clarification, I have spoken with Mark Palmer who has provided the following information on Enron's stance regarding Kyoto: Enron has always taken the view that the Kyoto protocol was not a workable solution to dealing with CO2 emissions. However it is not the principles behind Kyoto that we take issue with, rather it is the vehicle that has been devised to deliver the results. We firmly believe that there is work to be done in reducing greenhouse gases and Enron has put in place a number of programs that have measurably reduced carbon dioxide as well as SO2 and Oxides of Nitrogen (Nox) By way of example .... emissions trading programs have been put in place where these can be implemented Enron is one of the largest developers of natural gas-fired power plants which produce about 50 percent less carbon dioxide than coal or oil-fired plants demand-side management programs through EES to reduce energy usage the Catalytica program focus on renewable-related projects At the current time there is no formal statement from Enron Corp on the Kyoto issue.""

I fully agree on BF costs and DWR costs. I believe that you are right on Est RT$ = CAISOM Imbalance, but I need to check. On the question of retroactive ratemaking, it is my understanding that you are correct. PG&E probably won't rebill, but will need to put in place an adjustment to the going forward PX Credit to ""collect"" the overpayment of Negative CTC. All of this means that the impact of the FERC refund is less than 100c on the $ for the Negative CTC.

It is not clear to me which variable represents hourly ISO imbalance energy costs, but I assume its ""Est RT$"". If I am right, that variable would be affected by the mitigated market price (MMP) for CAISO imbalance energy. My comments are: The FERC is able to only order refunds to jurisdictional entities and, given appeals, it may take years before the full extent of thre refunds are known. Therefore there will be a significant difference between the change in the mitigated market price (MMP) as declared by FERC and the PX credit. That is, a 10% reduction in the MMP should not be construed as having a 10% effect on the PX credit, assuming it can be recalculated at all. Specifically, only some of the ""HC"" or ""Est RT$"" costs can be adjusted per FERC refund orders. Also, the PX credit is a tariffed rate. I do not believe the PU code allows for retroactive adjustments to tariffed rates unless there was an explicit cost tracking account (e.g. a balancing A/C). To my knowledge, no such account exists here. Finally, I do not see a relationship between MMPs and (1) block forward costs on any date and (2) PG&E and/or DWR's procurement costs for the net short position post January 19. So, those PX credit costs should be unaffected by any FERC refund order. Alan Comnes -----Original Message----- From: Steffes, James D.

The effect of the petition is to provide a moratorium on the repayment of any unsecured creditors, and on any judgments which those creditors obtain. The petition does not however prevent any preferred or secured creditors from enforcing their debts (in the latter case, to the extent of their security). The judge to whom the petition is presented appoints 3 administrators. 2 are appointed from a list of accountants that the court maintains, and the third (also appointed by the court) is a representative of one of the top third of the list of creditors. Once the administrators are appointed, the financial control of GMP will be their responsibility. They will authorize any future transactions, draw up the definitive list of creditors, and examine the solvency or otherwise of the company. In due course they will submit a report to the judge advising as to whether the company is insolvent or not. If insolvent, the Court will request that GMP provide a warranty for the difference between the amount owed and the assets. If this is not met within 14 days, subsidiary proceedings may be started to examine any personal liability of the management. Parallel with this, the administrators will be speaking to all the creditors with a view to reaching an inter creditor arrangement on repayment of an agreed level of debt. Even though secured creditors are not precluded in enforcing their security during the suspension of payments procedure, it is usual for them too to take part in these discussions. The outside lawyers seemed to think that the amount contained in the petition is equivalent to USD 85 million. We have no real idea how this is broken down, but the following shd be a rough guide: VAT authority - USD 25 million Veba - USD 15 million Enron - USD 5 million Total - USD 3million Bank debt - USD 22 million ? - balance USD15 million The Spanish lawyers confirmed our suspicion that the mark to market exposure may be difficult to prove as a debt. This exposure arises from the market difference we agreed to sell Dec. shipments to GMP (which then cd not put up the agreed purchase price to ensure delivery) and the current market price. Chris can confirm what these losses are today. We wd have to sue on those agreements (English arbitration), and then present to the administrators the arbitration judgments. However, as the administrators report is usually ready within 2-3months, I suspect that leaving aside any other factors there may be a timing problem here. The Spanish lawyers said that GMP Board may have some personal liability issues. The Board is supposed to call a shareholders meeting if the company is in financial difficulties. Moreover, if there has been stripping out of assets from GMP, then those responsible may face criminal sanction On the issue of preferences, it wd appear that Spanish law is somewhat inconsistent. On the one hand there is old jurisprudence to the effect that any and all transactions entered into by the debtor before its insolvency can be challenged by the administrators, irrespective of whether those transactions wd constitute a preference. On the other hand there is jurisprudence of equivalent weight which states that this is not the case, and that only preferences may be challenged. The Spanish lawyers were not able to say which system wd apply in the current scenario, but their insolvency lawyer made the following points: there was no immediate threat from anyone against Enron or ECTRIC Spain. The whole issue about preferences is not dealt with until the report by the administrators is made to the judge. There is no chance of any nasty shocks like injunctions on Arcos etc. the payment to Enron of USD50 million at the same time as the VAT authorities were not being paid shd not overly worry Enron at the moment, as such payments are unlikely to be seen as a preference. most companies (even those judged insolvent) end up being dissolved voluntarily, probably as a result of the uncertainty of Spanish insolvency law. If a voluntary arrangement is reached it is unlikely to provide for anything but the most obvious preference (and the transfer of the strategic oil from GM to ECTRIC Spain wd not fall within this category) The VAT authorities (probably the main creditor) are not pro active in these sorts of proceedings and tend to take a back seat For what t is worth, GM made the following points: GM's banks' inability to fund further prompted GMP management to make the petition (this despite the fact that GM had previously assured Enron that the GMP bank debt was minimal) petition is for Pta 10 billion GM lawyer said shd have made decision earlier to present the petition GM lawyer also said that GMP had made what he called ""third party financing"" of Pta 6 billion, and accepted my suggestion that the administrators wd be asking for such funds back GMP wd be willing to put up Don Antonio's assets to secure Enron's continuing supplies to it (we have heard that many times before). Without such supplies GM stated that GMP was insolvent. They were not able to provide a reason as to why such assets cd not be pledged beforehand GMP sees Enron as the ""key"", namely that the supplies if resumed wd trigger the payment to GM of its outstanding receivables. GM wants Enron to meet with the administrators next week. It is early days but I wd suggest the following: unlikely the old man's assets will be forthcoming likley the company will go into insolvency likley the creditors will reach a voluntary arrangement therefore unlikely there will be any clawback of earlier payments/strategic storage oil equally, unlikely Enron will receive any recognition of its MTM debt Chris, let me know if there is anything you wd like to add/clarify. otherwise once we get the petition we will advise further. tks",Company Business/Strategy

FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, t= he commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of= all questions. There was a general consensus that standards were needed; = much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seeme= d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo= rward and how far they needed to go. Panelists urged the need to mover for= ward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha= t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t= o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward. There was d= iscussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the= reins in the future. On an interesting tangential note, there was noticea= ble conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two org= anizations somewhat common during the discussions.=20 =20 FERC Deliverables A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne= eded from the Commission. Staffers probed all panelists to find what they = felt was critical. =20 The first major topic was ""How many RTOs? What is their scope?"" All panel= ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b= y FERC, in strong definitive language. N o one offered any specific langua= ge, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement. The next topic was, ""What will be standard market design?"" Panelists varie= d on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent. Some urged f= or one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid sta= ndard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (= followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the curre= nt situation. The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha= t the industry needed to move forward. They continually visited this topic= throughout their discussions, asking questions like, ""Do we need to issue = a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?"" and, ""How much detail do you= need us to provide?"" General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they = wanted strong leadership in this areas. Kormos and Burkes went so far as t= o say FERC should ""Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a= little further."" Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, bu= t in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and t= he need for cautious investigation. =20 One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc= heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th= e ""RTO Design and RTO Implementation"" section would address many of the que= stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design. Korm= os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying = a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry. The se= ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following = questions: ? Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occu= r, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i= s nonetheless efficient? Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there= be others that must be accommodated? ? Transmission Service - Are transmission services required to sch= edule (""covered"" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protect= ing from congestion charges (both ""covered"" and ""uncovered"" schedules are a= llowed)?=20 ? Loop Flows - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission = services appropriate? If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues= to be addressed? ? Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing pr= ior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to reti= re those contracts? Are there other solutions? ? Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function?= Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules)= , be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced sche= dules), or will they be required at all? ? Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed = in standard ways? Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary= services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as fina= ncial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)? ? Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? = Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce= ss, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technical= ly unwieldy? ? Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrate= d into the new world? Should systems be designed with the assumption that = non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO? Or should they be designed to t= reat each NJE as a separate entity? Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica= l questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which = to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions= , pointing out that vague answers (i.e., ""do congestion management"") will t= ake a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., ""LMP with financi= al hedging instruments"") will take only months. The Commission asked Mike = about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible = to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed. Now for a funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) refer= red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati= on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest. Kormos flat out= said, ""My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't = believe that that statement is true."" He then backpedaled a bit and said t= hat it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assert= ion by the Northwest interests was false. NERC and GISB A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-se= tting organization. Massey went so far as to ask, ""Are we looking at a bea= uty contest between NERC and GISB?"" Cook and Boswell then went into severa= l short polite jabs at each other's organizations. Other participants cont= inually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization. Interesting= ly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI= SB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the ""new"" structure of NERC and= did not focus on its history. Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a= sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were= they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?). GISB was easily a= ble to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin= g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Poin= t, Brownell. Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-m= an. He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's suppos= ed ""successes,"" such as TLR and E-Tag. If staffers have tenure, they will = likely remember that these ""successes"" have not been so successful, resulti= ng in several filings and interventions. We may also wish to file comments= in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show= the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction. There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues= , but general consensus was that I could not be done. There was also some = talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB. The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly ur= ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade= rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward. NERC s= omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position. In general, I would= say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top. Let me know if you have any questions.

 to Enron -- Coal and Enviro Related","Below is the text of recommendations taken from the summary of recommendations in the Cheney Energy Report being released later this morning that focus on coal and coal-related issues, including environmental. ""The NEPD Group (National Energy Policy Development) recommends that the President direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to propose multi-pollutant legislation. The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct the EPA Administrator to work with Congress to propose legislation that would establish a flexible, market-based program to significantly reduce and cap emissions fo sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury from electric power generators. Such a program (with appropriate measures to address local concerns) would provide significant public health benefits even as we increase electricity supplies. Establish mandatory reduction targets to emissions of three main pollutants: sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury. Phase in reductions over a reasonable period of time, similar to the successful acid rain reduction program established by the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act. Provide regulatory certainty to allow utilities to make modifications to their plants without fear of new litigation. Provide market-based incentives, such as emissions trading credits to help achieve the required reductions."" ""The NEPD Group recognizes the importance of looking to technology to help us meet the goals of increasing electricity generation while protecting our environment. To that end, the NEPD Group recommends that the President direct the Department of Energy to continue to develop advanced clean coal technology by: Investing $2 billion over 10 years to fund research in clean coal technologies. Supporting a permanent extension of the existing research and development tax credit. Directing federal agencies to explore regulatory approaches that will encourage advancements in environmental technology. ""The NEPD Group recomemnds that the President direct federal agencies to provide greater regulatory certainty relating to coal electricity generation through clear policies that are easily applied to business decisions."" ""The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy and other relevant agencies, to review New Source Review regulations, including administrative interpretations and implementation, and report to the President within 90 days on the impact of the regulations on investment in new utility and refinery generation capacity, energy efficiency, and environmental protection."" ""The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct the Attorney General to review existing enforcement actions regarding New Source Review to ensure that the enforcement actions are consistent with the Clean Air Act and its regulations."" ""The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct federal agencies to support continued research into global climate change; continue efforts to identify environmentally and cost-effective ways to use market mechanisms and incentives; continue development of new technologies; and cooperate with allies, including through international processes, to develop technologies, market-based incentives, and other innovative approaches to address the issue of global climate change.",Company Business/Strategy

It carried the LA Times version of the Lockyer comments a couple days ago. Today, it has the NY Times article on Ken Lay. It's pretty clear that in the near-term, Enron and it's leadership are at risk of being engulfed in a political firestorm which bounces from coast to coast, gaining strength each step of the way. However, it is the long-term challenge that draws my attention. From my research to date, I am left with the strong impression that the Enron's capacity for acquiring, distilling and assessing business information is much stronger than it's abilities with public policy information. Ken Lay, you and your team have shaped a innovative and entrepreneurial company rooted in agile arbitrage of business knowledge. Like Goldman Sachs, it is hard for the ""man on the street"" to understand precisely what Enron does. However, because of your presence in businesses that play out daily in homes, schools and small businesses, Enron will be scrutinized in a way the Goldman couldn't imagine in it's worst nightmares. From my perspective, the success of Enron's business model demands a sure footing in both business and public policy. Going forward, these two areas of expertise need become intertwined to assure the success of the highly sophisticated, ethical, innovative and insightful global corporation known as Enron. I would like to help you succeed with this challenge. I look forward to our discussions. Kevin 213-926-2626 Advertisers make this site possible. There were 30,693 page views last week.

Now they must decide whether those companies have done anything illegal. State Attorney General Bill Lockyer said Thursday he believes the evidence ``strongly suggests'' power companies acted illegally to drive up prices. He has said that he would love to put top energy executives in jail. Brandon Bailey and Chris O'Brien in the San Jose Mercury -- 5/25/01 Davis blackout warnings -- a significant policy change aimed at minimizing business and consumer disruptions, Gov. Gray Davis ordered state officials Thursday to enact a three-tier blackout warning system. Forecasts of blackouts will be issued 48 hours beforehand, Davis said. General areas will be identified in warnings issued 24 hours before likely outages. Precise locations will be announced an hour before the power is cut, he said. Dan Morain and Nancy Vogel in the Los Angeles Times Greg Lucas and Lynda Gledhill in the San Francisco Chronicle Noam Levey and Dion Nissenbaum in the San Jose Mercury John Hill in the Sacramento Bee Ed Mendel in the San Diego Union Robert Garrett in the Riverside Press Michael Coit in the Santa Rosa Press -- 5/25/01 Davis' popularity plunges in poll -- With California's energy crisis mounting, Democratic Gov. Gray Davis has suffered a precipitous fall in his job approval rating and image among state residents, according to a Field Poll released yesterday. For the first time since his November 1998 election, more Californians have an unfavorable view of Davis' performance than favorable. Carla Marinucci in the San Francisco Chronicle Hallye Jordan in the San Jose Mercury John Marelius in the San Diego Union -- 5/25/01 Poll puts Riordan, Davis in tight race -- Californians' assessment of Gov. Gray Davis has plummeted drastically as he has struggled to handle the state energy crisis, placing outgoing Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan in a virtual dead heat with him for the 2002 governor's race, according to a Field Poll released Thursday. Though Riordan has given no clear indication that he intends to run for governor, 42 percent of registered voters said they would support the Republican mayor should he challenge Davis, the Democratic incumbent. Forty-three percent said they would vote for Davis. Emily Bazar in the Sacramento Bee -- 5/25/01 California to gain from GOP's loss -- A single party switch in the Senate on Thursday handed California's Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer new clout with key leadership roles likely on issues ranging from military base closings to environmental cleanups. Vermont Sen. James Jeffords' announcement that he was quitting the Republican Party to be an independent affiliated with Democrats set up a takeover in which the Democrats, with a de facto 51-49 majority, will assume all Senate leadership posts and committee chairs. Bill Hillburg in the Los Angeles Daily News -- 5/25/01 PUC and 'baseline' rates -- Nine days after structuring the largest electricity rate increase in California history, state regulators on Thursday launched a reexamination of the unpopular baselines used to determine how much each residential customer will pay. If the indicators are revised upward, as most expect, that would grant some customers relief from the rate hike but could necessitate future ones to generate enough revenue for power purchases. Tim Reiterman in the Los Angeles Times Michael Bazeley in the San Jose Mercury Carrie Peyton in the Sacramento Bee -- 5/25/01 Enron Bush -- Curtis H?bert Jr., Washington's top electricity regulator, said he had barely settled into his new job this year when he had an unsettling telephone conversation with Kenneth L. Lay, the head of the nation's largest electricity trader, the Enron Corporation. Mr. H?bert, chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said that Mr. Lay, a close friend of President Bush's, offered him a deal: If he changed his views on electricity deregulation, Enron would continue to support him in his new job. Lowell Bergman and Jeff Gerth in the New York Times -- 5/25/01 Lockyer comes out swinging at oilman Davis has plenty of company in depths of poll -- The reaction from Gov. Gray Davis' camp to yesterday's poll showing him in the dumper was quick and blunt. ""Tell me something I don't already know,"" adviser Paul Maslin said after being hit with the news that the latest Field Poll showed Davis' job rating down 18 points since January. ""None of this is news to us,"" Maslin said. Matier & Ross in the San Francisco Chronicle -- 5/25/01 Water and power -- The California Public Utilities Commission authorized an increase in American States Water Co.'s rates at the Bear Valley Electric customer service area of its Southern California Water Co. unit to recover $2.4 million in deferred electric power costs. The amount will be recovered from customers over a five-year period. Sam Favate; Dow Jones Newswires -- 5/25/01 Muni power -- Gov. Davis said he received a pledge Thursday from municipal utility officials that their agencies will sell excess power to the state at prices much lower than in the past. Despite simmering resentment at subjecting their customers to rolling blackouts, the muni officials promised Davis they will keep cooperating with the state. Municipal utility customers, including those in the Modesto, Turlock and Merced irrigation districts, will continue to face power blackouts, officials said afterward. Jim Miller in the Modesto Bee -- 5/25/01 Edison merit raises -- Southern California Edison, which is struggling to stay out of bankruptcy, will hand out $19 million in merit raises to its 12,000 employees today, but top executives will forgo the raises because of the company's financial woes. Edison has doled out hefty merit raises in the past. But this year, the company will pay the minimum under its variable compensation program, which rewards employees for meeting certain company goals. Kate Berry in the Orange County Register -- 5/25/01 Cities with own utilities ask FERC to bar blackouts -- More than 15 California cities that have municipal utilities, including Anaheim, are asking federal regulators to exempt them from electricity blackouts ordered by the state's Independent System Operator. The city of Vernon was first to ask the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to rule that the ISO cannot force it to participate in California's rolling blackouts to serve demand in other areas. Vernon's utility argued that it was ridiculous to subject its customers to blackouts when it had enough power to keep the lights on. Amy Strahan Butler in the Orange County Register -- 5/25/01 Utility tax windfall -- As electricity rates rise, consumers will get hit with a double whammy because of an obscure utility bill tax that many California cities have quietly been collecting for years. A member of the state Board of Equalization charges that some cities will reap windfalls from the utility user tax, and he is backing a grass-roots movement to slash or repeal it. Few local governments are hurrying to forfeit the money, saying that they need it to pay their own higher energy bills. Wendy Thermos in the Los Angeles Times -- 5/25/01 An air of discontent over diesel backups -- Gov. Gray Davis said yesterday that he may ask companies to run their emergency generators during Stage 3 electricity alerts as a way to stave off blackouts. And when blackouts do occur, thousands of tractor-trailer-size generators will whir to life, powering elevators and lights, hospital equipment, even assembly lines. But that prospect has created major concerns. Most of those industrial- strength generators run on diesel oil, a highly polluting fuel. Because they were intended for emergency use, generators have escaped most environmental regulations. What's more, they are likely to be called into service on the hottest, smoggiest days of the year. Carolyn Said in the San Francisco Chronicle -- 5/25/01 Power price controls -- The House Energy and Commerce Committee delayed consideration of a major energy bill Thursday as Republicans and Democrats met privately to explore a possible compromise placing price controls on soaring wholesale electric rates on the West Coast. The negotiations hinted at a possible watershed change in the Republicans' staunch opposition to price controls. An earlier effort to include such controls in the bill turned contentious and was defeated on a mostly partisan vote in subcommittee. Les Blumenthal in the Sacramento Bee -- 5/25/01 For seniors, the heat can kill, doctors warn -- As summer slouches toward Sacramento amid a drumbeat of calls to conserve electricity, doctors and advocates for the elderly are sounding a counter-theme. Heat can kill. And most often, it kills seniors. Year after year, heat waves around the United States are deadlier than hurricanes or floods, tornadoes or earthquakes, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Carrie Peyton and Nancy Weaver Teichert in the Sacramento Bee -- 5/25/01 Outages could be fatal for disabled -- Around the clock, an electric pump supplies supplementary oxygen to 66-year-old Benny Pritchett's diseased lungs. Pritchett worries that a rolling blackout might kill him. ""The electricity goes out, I'm a dead man,"" said the San Bernardino apartment dweller and former chain-smoker. ""I've got a (back-up) oxygen tank. It lasts two hours. When it runs out, I'm dead."" Rolling blackouts aren't expected to last much more than an hour, say Southern California Edison officials, but their Web site recommends that any customer dependent on electrically operated life-support equipment buy an emergency generator. Richard Brooks in the Riverside Press -- 5/25/01 Gasoline prices -- Average gasoline prices statewide are nearly $2 a gallon, and the Los Angeles region has once again been dubbed the nation's hub of traffic congestion. So, what's a good Southern Californian to do? Plan a road trip. Hugo Martin in the Los Angeles Times -- 5/25/01 Offshore drilling -- A federal advisory panel Thursday urged the Bush administration to identify the five most promising areas to drill for natural gas in coastal waters off California and other states, which have been off limits to drilling for nearly 20 years. Citing the nation's unmet energy needs, the advisory group to Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton suggested that locating the top reservoirs of natural gas would help determine if there ""are grounds and support for a limited lifting of"" moratoriums on offshore drilling. The ban now covers 610 million acres of ocean off the Pacific, Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Kenneth Weiss in the Los Angeles Times -- 5/25/01 Judge demands straight answers from El Paso Corp. -- An irate judge threatened yesterday to subpoena the president of a Texas energy firm accused of manipulating California natural gas prices, saying he couldn't get straight answers out of another high-ranking company executive. The eruption by Curtis Wagner Jr., the administrative law judge presiding over a federal probe of alleged market manipulation by El Paso Corp., prompted the company to schedule voluntary testimony by President William Wise today in Washington, D.C. Bernadette Tansey in the San Francisco Chronicle -- 5/25/01 El Paso executive and collusion -- The head of a Texas energy conglomerate personally endorsed a deal between two subsidiaries accused of manipulating the natural gas market in Southern California to drive up prices, a senior official of the firm testified Thursday. The testimony in a trial-like hearing before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission raised questions about whether top officials of Houston-based El Paso Corp. violated FERC rules requiring arm's-length dealings within a corporate family. The admission by El Paso executive Ralph Eads marked a shift from his previous testimony and was elicited through sharp questioning by an angry judge who threatened to subpoena Eads' boss. Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar in the Los Angeles Times -- 5/25/01 Riverside no blackouts -- Southern California Edison won't immediately challenge Riverside's decision against using rolling blackouts to save energy this summer, a spokesman said Thursday. Edison doesn't care how the city of Riverside curtails its energy use as long as the city makes the required cuts during a statewide power shortage, Edison spokesman Steve Hansen said. Dan Lee in the Riverside Press -- 5/25/01 Energy crisis hits muni bonds -- Investors fled the California municipal bond market last month, taking with them a net $3.5 billion, their departure prompted in part by the state's energy crisis and taxes, a fund analysis firm said Thursday. The withdrawals in April marked the worst such outflow in years, and it comes as the state is preparing this August to issue a record $13.4 billion in bonds to bail out utilities. Loretta Kalb in the Sacramento Bee -- 5/25/01 With a perfectly negative crisis record, Davis desperate for a win -- So far, Gov. Gray Davis has amassed an unblemished record in his handling of the energy crisis. Not one major aspect of the situation has moved in the positive direction Davis said -- and clearly hoped -- it would, to wit: Dan Walters in the Sacramento Bee -- 5/25/01 Hot days don't cut the power -- A combination of factors kept the state's beleaguered system out of the red this time. The heat wave didn't hit all areas of the state at the same time, and cooler weather in the Pacific Northwest got power flowing from that region to California again. Also, there have been no new power-plant malfunctions, and many of the smaller generating facilities that were AWOL a few weeks ago, when the last blackouts hit, are operating again. A huge potential contributor to blackout avoidance -- but one that's difficult to quantify -- is conservation. Jack Katzanek in the Riverside Press -- 5/25/01 Long Beach Boeing layoffs -- Reflecting a sagging market for 100-seat jetliners, the Boeing Co. will lay off about 600 employees this year at its commercial factory in Long Beach, the company confirmed Thursday. That decision followed an internal study by Boeing that was completed earlier this year, said spokesman Warren Lamb, who did not elaborate. Ian Hanigan in the Long Beach Press -- 5/25/01 Hahn -- His job is to both prosecute and defend. And with that tricky mandate, Los Angeles City Atty. James Kenneth Hahn for 16 years has led a law office that, in sheer numbers, would rank among the biggest in the country. With some 450 attorneys, responsibility for both criminal and civil cases, and an annual budget of $70 million, the office, like the city it serves, is big, diverse, complex. But a review of Hahn's record suggests that his performance has been mixed--deliberate and plodding, pragmatic and obstinate. Greg Krikorian and Patrick McGreevey in the Los Angeles Times -- 5/25/01 Villaraigosa and Hahn and housing -- It doesn't fire up voters like a stump speech on crime, schools or traffic congestion. But the sheer magnitude of the city's housing shortage has placed it squarely--albeit quietly--on the agendas of both candidates running for mayor of Los Angeles. Eight years of a widely criticized lack of mayoral attention to the housing problem combined with a high concentration of low-wage workers has earned Los Angeles a reputation as one of the most unaffordable, overcrowded metropolitan centers in the country, plagued by low home ownership rates and slum conditions. Lee Romney in the Los Angeles Times -- 5/25/01 Villaraigosa and Hahn annd crime and gangs -- Mayoral candidates Antonio Villaraigosa and City Attorney James Hahn continued Thursday to compare their plans to deal with crime as they near the June 5 runoff election. Hahn, filing papers in court to seek injunctions against two Wilmington gangs, touted his efforts over the past several years to control gang activity throughout the city. ""The root of the violence is drugs and ... for turf and control,"" Hahn said of the two gangs -- but which, he added, applies to most gangs in the city. Rick Orlov in the Los Angeles Daily News -- 5/25/01 Dean Andal -- State Board of Equalization member Dean Andal is expected to announce today that he plans to run for state controller next year. The 41-year-old Republican from Stockton said he will run on a platform that includes lowering utility taxes paid by residents and businesses in Los Angeles, which are 10% and 12.5%, respectively. The story is in the Los Angeles Times -- 5/25/01 Jim Rogan -- President Bush on Thursday nominated former Congressman James Rogan to be undersecretary of commerce for intellectual property and director of the U.S. Trademark Office. The job pays $130,200 a year. Bush's selection of Rogan, which will require confirmation by the Senate, could be a positive sign for Hollywood, which has been lobbying for increased enforcement of copyright laws, including a crackdown on Internet piracy. Bill Hillburg in the Los Angeles Daily News -- 5/25/01 Living wage -- While attorneys speculated on the constitutionality of Santa Monica's newly approved living wage law, hotel housekeeper Blanca Mendez was just hoping Thursday that she can benefit if a raise to $10.50 an hour goes into effect next summer at large downtown and beach-side businesses. ""It would be fantastic,"" said Mendez, who now earns $8.50 an hour after seven years at the Streamline Moderne-style Shangri-La Hotel near the ocean. ""The economy is very difficult; everything is getting expensive, like gas, like energy."" Oscar Johnson and Ofelia Casillas in the Los Angeles Times -- 5/25/01 9 tribes' casino plans put on hold -- Gov. Gray Davis won't approve any more agreements with Indian tribes to allow casinos until the federal courts resolve a legal challenge to California's Indian gaming law. So far, the governor's moratorium on new Indian gaming compacts, announced in a letter to nine California tribes, doesn't appear to affect three Sonoma County tribes that have announced plans for casinos. But it could delay the progress of the nine other tribes that have asked the governor to negotiate gaming agreements, including the Round Valley tribe in Mendocino County. Steve Hart in the Santa Rosa Press -- 5/25/01 Charity foundations growth -- California's charitable foundation assets--which were relatively modest as recently as two decades ago--are now growing at a rate faster than those in the rest of the country, according to a study by the new USC Center on Philanthropy and Public Policy. In 1978, California held 8% of national foundation assets; in 1998 it accounted for 14%, the study said. During the same period, the state's share of foundation grants grew from 7% to 11% of total giving nationwide, it said. ""California is catching up and jumping forward,"" said Marcia K. Sharp, a research fellow at the USC Center on Philanthropy and Public Policy, and a co-author of the study. Anne-Marie O'Connor in the Los Angeles Times -- 5/25/01 Documents seized in S.F. minority contract probe are inadmissible -- In a potential blow to prosecutors, a U.S. judge said that federal investigators violated a San Francisco city official's privacy rights when they searched her office looking for evidence of fraud in a city minority contracting program. The FBI seized hundreds of pages of records from the San Francisco Human Rights Commission office of chief contract compliance officer Zula Jones in August 1999. Chuck Finnie and Lance Williams in the San Francisco Chronicle -- 5/25/01 Feinstein fast-tracks water storage plans -- California can't forestall a water crisis without building more storage facilities, Sen. Dianne Feinstein said yesterday in responding to environmental critics of her bill to reauthorize the CalFed ecosystem restoration program. Eric Brazil in the San Francisco Chronicle Michael Gardner in the San Diego Union -- 5/25/01 Californians' recycling efforts hit skids -- Californians are recycling a lower percentage of redeemable plastic, glass and aluminum beverage containers than they have in more than a decade, the state Department of Conservation reported Thursday. While officials note the recycling drop is partially due to an increasing number of products available for redemption, they also point to research suggesting consumers' habits may be slipping. Ed Fletcher in the Sacramento Bee -- 5/25/01 UC admissions policy -- A UC Berkeley request to be exempted from a University of California admissions policy is creating concern among administrators and faculty who object to looking at one campus in isolation. Instead, they said, the Berkeley request probably should be folded into a systemwide review of admissions already under way. Tanya Schevitz in the San Francisco Chronicle -- 5/25/01 Irvine cash crop: business -- Irvine One of the largest commercial developments in the county could be built in the next five to seven years, replacing checkered fields of strawberries and other crops. The 670 acres of fields and a scattering of industrial buildings just outside Irvine's northeastern border is large enough to host 12 Disneylands, but The Irvine Co. has other plans. Laura Corbin, Jennifer Hieger and Elizabeth Aguilera in the Orange County Register -- 5/25/01 Like a Rolling Tone -- It looked like a scene from the hotel karaoke lounge, where the microphone-hogging guy won't stop belting Tom Jones tunes and a few cocktail-sipping patrons keep their eyes glued to their drinks in embarrassment. But it was official state business at the state Capitol on Thursday when members of the Assembly attempted to pay tribute to Bob Dylan on his 60th birthday by feebly singing along with his 1973 recording of ""Forever Young."" Lesli A. Maxwell in the Fresno Bee -- 5/25/01 Joe Lockhart -- Barely six months after joining Oracle Corp. as a communications consultant to chief executive Larry Ellison, former White House press secretary Joe Lockhart has left the database software firm. Both sides yesterday denied a rift between the two men and blamed Lockhart's frequent trips from his home in Washington, D.C., to Oracle's Redwood Shores headquarters for the departure.

You are quoted mid-way through re Houston emissions. Tx Andrew Meet Enron, Bush's biggest contributor Pratap Chatterjee 09/01/2000 The Progressive 23 Copyright (c) 2000 Bell & Howell Information and Learning Company. All rights reserved. Copyright Progressive Incorporated Sep 2000 Early last October, members of the ninth grade girls' track team and the boys' football team at suburban Houston's Deer Park High School's north campus returned from practice reporting severe breathing problems. That day, Deer Park registered 251 parts of ozone per billion, more than twice the federal standard, and Houston surpassed Los Angeles as the smoggiest city in the United States. One of the biggest contributors to Deer Park's pollution is a plant owned by Enron, Houston's wealthiest company. Enron and its executives are also the single largest contributors ($550,000 and counting) to the political ambitions of Texas Governor George W Bush, Republican candidate for President of the United States. Kenneth Lay, the chief executive of Enron, has personally given at least $250,000 in soft money to Bush's political campaigns. He is also one of the ""Pioneers""-a Bush supporter who has collected $100,000 in direct contributions of $1,000 or less. What is Enron? And what does it get in return for this largesse? Enron is the largest buyer and seller of natural gas in the country. Its 1999 revenues of $40 billion make it the eighteenth largest company in the United States. Enron invests in energy projects in countries around the world, including Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mozambique, and the Philippines. The company has recently expanded onto the Internet, buying and selling a dizzying array of products ranging from pulp and paper to petrochemicals and plastics, as well as esoteric products like clean air credits that utilities purchase to meet emission limits. Texas activists say that the tight connection between Bush and Lay bodes ill if Bush is elected. Andrew Wheat, from Texans for Public Justice, a campaign finance advocacy group in Austin, compares the symbiotic relationship between Enron and the governor to ""cogeneration""-a process used by utilities to harness waste heat vented by their generators to produce more power. ""In a more sinister form of cogeneration, corporations are converting economic into political power,"" he says. ""A Bush election fueled by Enron dollars could ignite in the public policy arena, and consumers would get burned."" And so may people in the Third World. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have both criticized Enron for colluding with police who brutally suppressed protests at the company's giant power plant in western India. The plant's operating firm is called the Dabhol Power Company. From 1992 to 1998, Enron owned 80 percent of it, with General Electric and Bechtel each holding a 10 percent share. (In 1998, the Indian state electricity board bought a 30 percent share of the company, which reduced Enron's stake to 50 percent.) For years, the plant has been the site of many nonviolent protests. ""The project has met with opposition from local people and activists from elsewhere in India on the grounds of its social, economic, and environmental impact,"" Amnesty wrote in a July 1997 report. ""Protesters and activists have been subjected to harassment, arbitrary arrest, preventive detention under the ordinary criminal law, and ill treatment. Amnesty International considers those who have been subjected to arrest and temporary periods of imprisonment as a result of undertaking peaceful protest to be prisoners of conscience, imprisoned solely for exercising their right to freedom of expression."" Amnesty's report found that ""women, who have been at the forefront of local agitation, appear to have been a particular target."" Just before dawn on June 3, 1997, police stormed the homes of several women. ""The policemen forcibly opened the door and dragged me out of the house into the police van parked on the road. (While dragging me) the police kept beating me on my back with batons. The humiliation meted out to the other members of my family was similar to the way I was humiliated. . . . My one-and-a-half year-old daughter held on to me but the police kicked her away,"" says Sugandha Vasudev Bhalekar-a twenty-four-year-old housewife who was three months pregnant at the time of her arrest, according to Amnesty's report. Amnesty found that another pregnant woman was beaten and several other women sustained injuries, including bruising, abrasions, and lacerations on arms and legs. Amnesty said the police involved in suppressing protests included ""the Special Reserve Police [SRP] on the site of the company."" It added: ""The involvement of the SRP in the harassment of protesters indicates the need for the three U.S. multinationals participating in the joint venture to take steps to ensure that all the management and staff of the DPC [Dabhol Power Company)-in particular, any security staff subcontracted to, seconded to, or employed by the company-are trained in human rights and are fully accountable for their actions. A January 1999 investigation by Human Rights Watch came to a stronger conclusion. ""Human Rights Watch believes that the Dabhol Power Corporation and its parent company Enron are complicit in these human rights violations,"" it said. ""The company, under provisions of law, paid the abusive state forces for the security they provided to the company. These forces, located adjacent to the project site, were only stationed there to deal with protests. In addition, contractors (for DPC) engaged in a pattern of harassment, intimidation, and attacks on individuals opposed to the Dabhol Power project. . . . The Dabhol Power Corporation refused to acknowledge that its contractors were responsible for criminal acts and did not adequately investigate, condemn, or cease relationships with these individuals."" Enron denies any wrongdoing. ""While we respect the mission of Human Rights Watch, we do not feel that its report on the Dabhol Power project is accurate,"" says an Enron spokesperson. ""The report refers to peaceful protests, when, in fact, the reason the police were positioned near our site is that there have been many acts of violence against our employees and contractors. Dabhol Power Company has worked hard to promote positive relations with the community. Unfortunately, the good relationship we have built with a large percentage of the community was not reflected in the report. Enron is committed to providing energy and communications services while preserving the human rights of citizens and our workers."" Enron has also raised a stink in Bolivia with its involvement in the Cuiaba Integrated Energy Project. The project is run by Transredes, Bolivia's hydrocarbon transport company, which came into being in 1997 after Bolivia privatized its oil sector under the influence of the World Bank. A joint venture of Enron and Shell owns 50 percent of Transredes. On January 31, 2000, a Transredes oil pipeline erupted and dumped an estimated 10,000 barrels of refined crude oil and gasoline into the Desaguadero River, which supports indigenous communities such as the Uru Muratos. ""This problem is Transredes's number one priority, and we are committed to continue to work hard to mitigate the short- and long-term social and environmental impact,"" wrote Steve Hopper, president of Transredes, in a letter addressed ""To the People of Bolivia"" on February 7. Facing starvation from the Loss of their life-sustaining waterfowl and fish, the Uru Muratos left their ancestral lands at the southern shores of Lake Poopo in April and marched eighty-five miles to the city of Oruro to ask for government help. ""We subsequently reached an agreement with them to provide certain levels of relief and assistance,"" says Keith Miceli, general manager for public relations for Enron, South America. In its actions overseas, Enron has made a practice of taking advantage of corporate welfare. And it has enlisted George W Bush in this effort. For example, in March 1997, Lay wrote a letter to Bush that was subsequently released to the press under Texas open records laws, asking him to contact every member of the Texas delegation in Congress to explain how ""export credit agencies of the United States are critical to U.S. developers like Enron, who are pursuing international projects in developing countries."" These agencies include the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), which provides political risk coverage and financial support to U.S. companies investing abroad. ""OPIC provided financing or insurance coverage worth almost $300 million for Enron's foreign projects just last year, according to government records,"" The New York Times reported. ""Enron officials have in the past asked Mr. Bush to help lobby lawmakers to appropriate funds of OPIC, as well as for the Export-Import Bank, another federal agency that aids American companies abroad."" Enron received $200 million in political risk insurance for the Dabhol project in 1996. And it received $200 million in insurance from OPIC in 1999 for its Bolivian project. The Enron Methanol plant in Pasadena, Texas, lies in the Houston Ship Channel area, the nation's largest concentration of petrochemical plants just east of the city. The plant has won special concessions from Governor Bush, allowing the company to pollute without a permit, as well as giving it immunity from prosecution for violating some environmental standards. Plants like this in Texas cumulatively emit twice as much nitrogen oxide, a key ingredient of smog, as do all the nine million cars in Texas put together. Only 7 percent of the more than 3,500 tons of nitrogen oxide emitted by the Enron Methanol plant in 1997 would have been permitted had Enron not gotten away with this under the ""grandfather clause"" of the 1971 Texas Clean Air Act, which allows plants built before 1971 to continue their polluting practices. Bush extended this clause under the 1999 Clean Air Responsibility Enterprise (CARE) program that his office drew up in a series of secret meetings with representatives of the top polluters in the state, as Molly Ivins reported. CARE waives permit requirements for plants that volunteer to cut emissions. The CARE program is backed up by an act that Bush signed in May 1995 giving sweeping protections to polluters that perform internal environmental or safety audits. The law makes these audit documents confidential and allows polluters to escape responsibility for environmental violations. To date, Enron has conducted five such audits and filed for immunity from prosecution for violations of the law, according to the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission (TNRCC), the state equivalent of the Environmental Protection Agency. Tamara Maschini, who lives about five miles from the Enron plant, is one of the founders of a local environmental group called Clean Air Clear Lake. ""Whole families in this neighborhood have asthma because of the pollution from plants like Enron,"" she says. Mark Palmer, head of public relations for Enron, says that the company's contribution to local pollution is minimal. ""If the grandfather clause was canceled right now, we would benefit the most of any of the companies in Texas because our nitrogen oxide emissions add up to less than half a percent of the total,"" he says. Last year, the Bush campaign borrowed Enron's corporate jets eight times to fly aides around the country, more times than any of the thirty-four other companies that made their company aircraft available to the Presidential hopeful. And Lay often acts as George W. Bush's chaperone. On April 7, 2000, he played host to Bush and his father, the former President, at the Houston Astros' first home game of the season. The game was held in the baseball team's brand new stadium-Enron Field-which was built with the help of a $100 million donation from Enron. (The company got free advertising, a tax break, and a $200 million contract to supply power to the stadium in return.) Less than three weeks later, Lay joined candidate Bush in Washington, D.C., for a Republican fundraiser that topped all previous records by bringing in a staggering $21.3 million, easily the biggest one-night haul for any political party in history. ""Ken Lay is a noted business leader in Texas who has long been active in Republican politics,"" says Ray Sullivan, a spokesman for the Bush campaign. ""He is chair of the Governor's Business Council. But the governor has his own agenda based on what he believes is best for Texas and for the country."" For his part, Lay tries to put his contributions in a favorable light. ""When I make contributions to a candidate, it is not for some special favor, it's not even for access-although I'll be the first to admit it probably helps access,"" he told The New York Times. ""It is because I'm supporting candidates I strongly believe in personally."" In January 1999, Enron pitched in $50,000 to help pay for Bush's inaugural bash in Austin, Texas, after he won reelection for governor. Today, the polls show that George W Bush has a better than even chance of winning the Presidential election. If he does, it is very likely Ken Lay will be pitching in for another inaugural bash.

And Gov. Gray Davis announced a proposed=20 solution to one vexing problem: the utilities' failure to pay the state's= =20 small, alternative power generators, many of whom have stopped producing=20 power as a result. ?????Davis called the utilities ""shameful"" for failing to pay, and praised= =20 the alternative power generators, which include solar, wind and geothermal= =20 energy producers, as ""good corporate citizens"" who produced power although= =20 they weren't being paid. ?????""We are anxious to pay the [small producers], who are dropping like=20 flies,"" Davis said. ?????Despite the progress, it was hard for some people to look on the brigh= t=20 side after enduring outages that took place when the state's hunger for pow= er=20 was almost 50% less than at its summer peak. ?????""This is a taste, almost like an appetizer, of a really unpalatable me= al=20 that's going to be served up this summer,"" said Michael Shames of the Utili= ty=20 Consumers' Action Network in San Diego, himself a victim of a rolling=20 blackout that hit his office in San Diego early Tuesday. ?????Power officials have warned that this could be a grim summer in=20 California, since demand for electricity sharply rises when people turn on= =20 air conditioners. The state has been struggling to meet its power needs in= =20 recent months because of rising prices and a flawed deregulation plan that= =20 has left the two biggest private utilities on the brink of bankruptcy. Stat= e=20 leaders have so far failed to agree on a comprehensive plan to solve the=20 problems. Wally Quirk teaches a business class in a borrowed classroom Tuesday at=20 Sonoma State after the state's rolling blackouts cut the power to his usual= =20 classroom, which does not have any windows. SCOTT MANCHESTER / The Press Democrat ?????The latest round of blackouts began about 9:30 a.m. Tuesday when the= =20 California Independent System Operator, which runs the statewide grid,=20 determined that the demand for electricity was 500 megawatts more than the= =20 supply--an imbalance that meant the state was short on the power needed to= =20 supply electricity to about 375,000 homes. ?????Grid operators blamed a confluence of events, including warmer weather= ;=20 outages at several major power plants, including one unit of the San Onofre= =20 nuclear power station; a reduction in imports from the Pacific Northwest, a= nd=20 the shutdown of many alternative energy producers. Similar blackouts Monday= =20 were the first since January. ?????The situation improved somewhat by late Tuesday morning, with some=20 supplies restored and Californians conserving energy, and Cal-ISO was able = to=20 halt the rolling blackouts at 2 p.m. ?????Once again, customers of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power= =20 were spared, although the municipally owned utility said its electrical=20 surplus was smaller than usual. The DWP, like Southern California Edison, w= as=20 affected by an outage at the huge Mohave power plant in Nevada, as well as = by=20 planned outages at several of its facilities. ?????As in the past, by far the biggest impact was felt by customers served= =20 by Pacific Gas & Electric, the state's largest utility, which cut power to= =20 438,000 homes and businesses. ?????Edison cut power to 47,462 customers in about 40 cities, but eventuall= y=20 was able to avoid blackouts by shutting off the air conditioners of some of= =20 the 118,500 customers who participate in a voluntary cutoff program. ?????San Diego Gas & Electric cut power to 73,400 customers. ?????Innovative Ways of Coping ?????As on Monday, most people took the outages in stride, as an annoying b= ut=20 ultimately unavoidable inconvenience. ?????In Palmdale, four schools lost power during one of the hourlong=20 blackouts, but teachers and students pressed on in the sunlight pouring=20 through windows and skylights. At Barrel Springs Elementary, Principal Cruz= =20 Earls said the biggest problem came when students had to go to the bathroom= :=20 Hand in hand, they made their way through darkened hallways with flashlight= s. ?????All in all, it wasn't a terrible experience. Then again, the weather= =20 wasn't that hot Tuesday, with a high of 79 in Palmdale, so the shutdown of= =20 air conditioners wasn't much of a hardship. ""I don't want to think about th= e=20 conditions this could create in May or June,"" Earls said. ?????Businesses of all kinds complained about the lack of warning for the= =20 outages--and sometimes found innovative ways to get around the problem. ?????Rattled by news reports of Monday's rolling blackouts, El Burrito=20 Mexican Food Products in the city of Industry started its Tuesday shift at = 2=20 a.m. to beat the clock in the event of an outage. That hunch paid off.=20 Workers had just finished cooking and packaging the last batches of salsa a= nd=20 masa when the lights went out at 10:20 a.m. ?????Company owner Mark Roth said the firm will continue working odd hours = to=20 avoid further outages. But he isn't buying the line from the utilities that= =20 they can't provide advance warning because of concerns about looting and=20 rioting. ?????""We're ready to do whatever it takes to get through this thing,"" he=20 said. ""But they've got to give us some notification."" ?????At Big O Tires in Elk Grove, just south of Sacramento, owner Daniel Cr= um=20 had his 14 workers take an early lunch break or head to the warehouse to=20 reorganize the goods. Without electricity, they couldn't repair brakes or= =20 align front ends. ?????""I'd never let them be idle,"" said Crum. ?????At least two minor traffic accidents were blamed on the outages. ?????The blackouts resulted from a convergence of factors. ?????Demand was slightly higher than expected, probably because of=20 unseasonably warm weather. Supplies were tighter than usual, in part becaus= e=20 of several outages, including that at the Mohave plant, half of which was= =20 brought back on line by the end of the day. ?????The San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station was still limping along=20 without power from one of its two 1,100-megawatt units, which was shut down= =20 Feb. 3 after a half-hour fire in a nonnuclear part of the plant. Edison,=20 which operates San Onofre, initially estimated the unit would be out for=20 several weeks but recently said ""extensive damage"" to parts of the turbine= =20 will keep the unit out of commission until mid-June. ?????Shipments from the drought-stricken Pacific Northwest, which generates= =20 most of its electricity from large dams, were also down. ?????""Each time we take a measurement, we're closer to the all-time record= =20 for the driest year,"" said Dulcy Mahar, spokeswoman for the Bonneville Powe= r=20 Administration, the network of federal dams that provides the region with= =20 much of its electricity. ""We've been doing what we can, but we simply don't= =20 have power to sell."" ?????Finally, there was the problem of the small and alternative energy=20 producers, which have shut down plants because they haven't been paid by th= e=20 private utilities since November. Those outages have cost the state about= =20 3,000 megawatts of electricity, enough for about 2.3 million homes. ?????""You're seeing the system freeze up,"" said David Sokol, chairman and C= EO=20 of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co., which runs eight geothermal plants in t= he=20 Imperial Valley through its subsidiary, CalEnergy. His company hasn't shut= =20 down yet, but Sokol said smaller companies couldn't continue to sell their= =20 energy to utilities for free. ?????""Why should we fund Edison?"" he asked. ""That's just ridiculous."" ?????A Choice of 2 Rate Plans ?????Davis joined lawmakers in the Capitol on Tuesday to outline his plan t= o=20 get the producers running again. He said utilities have had no right to=20 collect money from ratepayers and then not use the funds to repay the small= =20 producers. The state has spent billions to buy power from large conventiona= l=20 producers on behalf of the utilities but has refused to pick up the tab for= =20 alternative energy. ?????""The utilities acted in a shameful manner by putting money in their=20 pockets that was designed to pay the [small producers],"" Davis said. ?????The plan outlined by Davis would allow the generators to choose betwee= n=20 two rate plans. They could decide to be paid 7.9 cents per kilowatt-hour ov= er=20 five years or 6.9 cents a kilowatt-hour over 10 years. ?????The utilities must begin paying the generators the new rates beginning= =20 April 1 or face fines, Davis said. ?????The question of how the companies will get paid the about $1.5 billion= =20 they are owed remains unresolved. That issue will be decided in coming week= s=20 as Davis' negotiators continue to work on rescue plans for the state's=20 financially hobbled private utilities. ?????PG&E spokesman Ron Low said the state's largest utility did not take= =20 kindly to Davis' criticism, and noted that the governor's plan is similar t= o=20 a proposal that PG&E made last week to producers. ?????Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of a trade group that includes so= me=20 of the small generators, described the plan as a positive step. ?????""The governor got it right in that it's not acceptable for small power= =20 producers to continue to generate and not be paid,"" Smutny-Jones said. ""But= =20 we'll need to see what the order says; the devil will truly be in the=20 details."" ?????Grid operators said the state's overall energy situation eased by midd= ay=20 Tuesday because of repairs at the Mohave plant and another large plant at= =20 Ormond Beach, and because the Western Area Power Administration came up wit= h=20 300 megawatts of electricity from Glen Canyon Dam. ?????Also, grid spokesman Patrick Dorinson said conservation savings spiked= =20 upward after earlier complaints that Californians weren't conserving. ?????""We saw the people of California probably conserve 900 megawatts today= ,""=20 he said.

In fact, they haven't. ?????More than anything, this week's events illustrate the delicate balance= =20 of factors that keep California illuminated, from the multitude of supply= =20 sources to the weather. ?????Temperatures were higher than usual.

To help officials predict available supply,=20 generators provide an annual maintenance plan that is updated regularly. ?????In addition, however, facilities sometimes shut down for unexpected=20 reasons: leaking tubes, burnt-out transformers, cracked turbines and faulty= =20 feed pumps. At one point Tuesday, about 8,200 megawatts were unavailable=20 because of unscheduled shutdowns. That's enough to supply about 6 million= =20 households, and up from 5,700 megawatts a week ago. ?????The huge 1,400-megawatt Mohave power plant near Laughlin, Nev., which= =20 supplies Southern California Edison and the Los Angeles Department of Water= =20 and Power, was felled Monday by a transformer problem.

""The way = I=20 see it, Californians take a lot of things on faith, working atop tall=20 buildings with all these earthquakes and power outages."" ?????For Long Beach office worker Dave Suhada, the anxiety has taken the fo= rm=20 of elevator phobia: a fear of getting stuck on an 80-degree day crammed in = a=20 pod of sweating, heavy-breathing humans, with no way out. ?????""I'm just eyeing the buttons to see which one I could push as fast as = I=20 can if the power goes out,"" he said.=20 ?????For 20-year-old Lisa Riley, it means entering the elevator each day in= =20 her Long Beach office building with a prayer.

Often she now opts for th= e=20 stairs. ?????In San Francisco, emergency services officials say that most of the=20 city's office buildings are equipped with backup generators to run elevator= s=20 and security equipment in the event of a blackout. ?????Fire Department spokesman Pete House said the city has 19 trucks with= =20 experts trained to extricate people trapped in elevators. Firefighters=20 handling blackout-related emergencies rescued a person trapped in a downtow= n=20 building Tuesday and handled five elevator mishaps Monday. ?????Christopher Stafford didn't get caught inside an elevator Monday, but= =20 suffered the next-worst thing: being stranded in his 15th-floor apartment= =20 after the power failed when he went home for lunch. ?????So the 41-year-old real estate worker trooped down the stairs to the= =20 lobby and even made some new friends along the way, helping a few elderly= =20 women who were struggling down the stairs. ?????""It was a pain,"" he acknowledged. ""But I have to tell you: I really li= ke=20 my panoramic view, so it's worth the hassle."" ?????Nowadays, Sherrie Tellier makes sure her cellular phone is in hand whe= n=20 she gets in the elevator.

Gray Davis said negotiations to buy the power grid owned= =20 by the state's largest utilities ""are proceeding at an accelerated pace."" ?????Wall Street consultant Joseph Fichera said talks with Southern=20 California Edison could be wrapped up within days, although those with PG&E= =20 are much less advanced.=20 ?????The administration and PG&E have not reached even an agreement in=20 principle, he said. PG&E, which has more debt than Edison, says its=20 transmission lines are more extensive than those of its Southern California= =20 counterpart. ?????The state wants to buy the utilities' transmission lines and other=20 assets for about $7 billion to provide cash to the utilities, help stabiliz= e=20 the electricity supply and ease the power crunch that has plagued Californi= a=20 for months. To research the grid purchase, Fichera said, the state has had = to=20 pore over 80,000 documents just to assess the utilities' liabilities. ?????""We are working at a good pace,"" said Fichera, chief executive of the= =20 New York firm Saber Partners. "" . . . If we get to a deal-breaker, it might= =20 be longer."" ?????By making Fichera, who is also a consultant to the Texas Public=20 Utilities Commission, available to reporters Tuesday, the Davis=20 administration was clearly trying to reassure the public that progress is= =20 being made on the governor's plan to pull the state out of the crisis. ?????Since mid-January, when the big utilities' credit failed and suppliers= =20 stopped selling to them, the state has spent nearly $3 billion buying=20 electricity from a handful of large suppliers in Texas, Oklahoma, Georgia a= nd=20 North Carolina. Not a cent has gone to the hundreds of alternative energy= =20 suppliers in California who provide about a quarter of the state's=20 electricity. ?????The Monday and Tuesday blackouts occurred partly because many of the= =20 cash-strapped alternative suppliers, including solar, biomass and wind powe= r=20 units, cut their normal supply to the system in half. They say Edison and= =20 PG&E have not paid them since November; the utilities say they are out of= =20 cash. ?????Assemblyman Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek) said the plight of the=20 alternative suppliers has dragged on because of the complexity of dealing= =20 with ""almost 700 individual contractors."" ?????Another delaying factor, said Keeley, who with state Sen. Jim Battin= =20 (R-La Quinta) worked for almost three months to come up with a legislative= =20 plan to lower the small producers' prices, was ""the huge enmity . . .=20 manifested between the utilities and the qualifying facilities. These peopl= e=20 just don't like each other."" ?????This week's blackouts provided two painful lessons for the Davis=20 administration: ?????* When it comes to electricity, size doesn't matter--every kilowatt=20 counts. During peak use, a small wind power facility in Riverside County ca= n=20 make the difference between full power and blackouts. ?????* There is no such thing as a partial solution. Unless the whole energ= y=20 equation is balanced, the parts don't work. ?????For the Davis plan to work, several key elements need to come together= =20 or utility customers will almost certainly face rate increases above the 19= %=20 already set in motion: ?????* The cost of power purchased by the state must be reduced through=20 long-term contracts with the big out-of-state producers. ?????These contracts, the details of which the Davis administration has kep= t=20 confidential, are still being negotiated by Davis consultant Vikram Budhraj= a=20 of the Pasadena firm Electric Power Group. The administration says it has= =20 concluded 40 contracts with generators, about half of which have been signe= d. ?????According to the most recent statistics released by the Department of= =20 Water Resources, which buys power for the state, current prices are still= =20 well above the rate state Treasurer Phil Angelides says is necessary for a= =20 planned $10-billion bond offering to succeed. ?????The bonds, set for sale in May, will be used to reimburse the state fo= r=20 the money it will have spent by that time to buy electricity. The state is= =20 currently spending at a rate of $58 million a day to buy power. If prices= =20 stay high, the $10 billion in bonds will not cover the state's power=20 purchases by the end of the summer. ?????Angelides says he cannot proceed with bridge financing for the bonds= =20 until the Public Utilities Commission devises a formula to guarantee that a= =20 portion of utility bills will be dedicated to bond repayment. Angelides has= =20 estimated that, under the January law that put the state in the power buyin= g=20 business, the state must be reimbursed $2.5 billion annually, and that $1.3= =20 billion is needed to service the debt. ?????PUC Administrative Law Judge Joseph R. DeUlloa is expected to announce= =20 his ruling on the reimbursement rate later this week, leading to a PUC vote= =20 on the matter as early as next week. ?????* The rates charged for electricity by the alternative producers, know= n=20 as qualifying facilities, must be cut at least in half, down from an averag= e=20 of more than 17 cents per kilowatt-hour. In his news conference Tuesday,=20 Davis said he will ask the PUC to set QF rates at 6.9 cents for 10-year=20 contracts and 7.5 cents for five-year contracts. ?????Meanwhile, PUC Chairman Loretta Lynch, a Davis appointee, said Tuesday= =20 that the commission will vote next week on a proposed order requiring=20 Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric to pay the QFs for=20 electricity in the future. Lynch said a recent PUC assessment showed that t= he=20 utilities have enough cash on hand for that. ?????""We are trying to make sure the folks providing the power get paid,""= =20 Lynch said. ""The qualified facilities have demonstrated that they haven't= =20 been paid and that it is impairing their ability to provide power."" ?????The utilities contend that if they pay the small providers what they o= we=20 them, there will not be enough money left to pay other creditors. ?????""There is not enough money in the current rate structure to pay the=20 [alternative producers], pay the [Department of Water Resources] and pay th= e=20 utilities for their generation,"" said John Nelson, a spokesman for PG&E. ?????* The utilities must sell to the state the power they produce=20 themselves, mainly from hydro and nuclear sources, at a rate only slightly= =20 above the cost of producing it. This is tied to the ongoing negotiations=20 between the Davis administration and the utilities to restore the=20 near-bankrupt utilities to solvency. ---=20 ?????Times staff writers Julie Tamaki, Miguel Bustillo and Tim Reiterman=20 contributed to this report. --- L.A., Long Beach File Suits Over Gas Companies' Prices=20 Energy: Separate actions allege a conspiracy and gouging.

Critic= s=20 renew call for full disclosure.=20 By DAN MORAIN , Times Staff Writer=20 ?????SACRAMENTO--As part of his closed-door negotiations to buy electricity= ,=20 Gov.

Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel declin= ed=20 to discuss the company's deal with the state. ?????""We couldn't get them to sign contracts; it was a sticking point,"" Dav= is=20 said of the decision to pay the fees of some generators. ""We had to lock do= wn=20 some power so we were not totally dependent on the spot market."" ?????The fees in question are part of an emission trading system known as= =20 RECLAIM. Under the system, companies are allotted a certain amount of=20 allowable pollution. If their operations pollute more, companies are requir= ed=20 to purchase credits on an open market. Currently the credits cost about $45= =20 per pound of pollution--an amount that can lead to a bill of well over $10= =20 million a year for a power plant. ?????The South Coast Air Quality Management District, which regulates=20 pollution in the Los Angeles Basin, is considering steps to significantly= =20 lower the cost of the system--a step that could considerably cut the state'= s=20 potential cost, Davis said. ?????Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey)=20 defended the decision to cover the power company's costs. ?????""It is a question of whether it brings down the price of power,"" she= =20 said. ""If it brings down the price of power, I don't have a problem with it= ."" ?????Nevertheless, word that the contracts could bind the state to pay=20 pollution fees caused some critics of Davis' policy to renew calls for Davi= s=20 to reconsider the secrecy surrounding the power negotiations. The payment= =20 provision underscores the fact that the contracts involve more than merely= =20 the prices the state will pay for its megawatts, the critics note. ?????""The Legislature should have known about it,"" said Senate President Pr= o=20 Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco). ""It is going to cost taxpayers money. It= =20 makes you wonder. . . . This was a policy issue that was never discussed wi= th=20 the Legislature."" ?????V. John White, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club, who also represents=20 alternative energy producers, called the contract proposal ""a horrible=20 precedent."" ?????""Until we know exactly what the state has agreed to and how much of a= =20 subsidy this represents, we can't determine how serious the breach of=20 principle this is,"" White said. ?????Another critic of the secrecy of the negotiations, Terry Francke,=20 general counsel for the California First Amendment Coalition, said the=20 provision in question ""raises the possibility that there are other=20 [concessions]"" that have not yet come to light. ?????In the summer, when demand for power is highest, some generators=20 probably will exceed pollution limits set by regional air quality managemen= t=20 districts. ?????To avert blackouts, state officials might ask the companies to keep=20 plants running. In such cases, some sources familiar with aspects of the=20 contracts said, the contract language could be interpreted to suggest that= =20 the state would cover any fines--although Davis said Tuesday the state will= =20 not cover the cost of fines. ?????A recent Dynegy filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission=20 underscores the rising cost of pollution-related measures. The company, whi= ch=20 is partners with NRG Energy in three California plants in El Segundo, Long= =20 Beach and Carlsbad in San Diego County, said its ""aggregate expenditures fo= r=20 compliance with laws related to the regulation of discharge of materials in= to=20 the environment"" rose to $14.3 million in 2000, from $3.6 million in 1999. ?????A South Coast Air Quality Management spokesman said Dynegy's facilitie= s=20 appear to be fairly clean--although Sierra Club lobbyist White said Dynegy= =20 has been seeking a permit at one of its plants to burn fuel oil, which is= =20 dirtier than natural gas. ?????Davis said he intends to ""make this information public,"" but he added= =20 that ""we do not want to put the public's interest in jeopardy by asking the= m=20 to pay higher prices."" ?????""Nobody likes the notion that [the administration is] not being fully= =20 forthcoming,"" Davis said.

The=20 company, a division of Florida-based B/E Aerospace Inc., makes parts for th= e=20 aerospace industry. The sudden loss of power caused its sophisticated metal= =20 cutting and grinding machines to crash, ruining precision parts in producti= on. ?????But the losses don't end there.

""That's all I needed."" ?????Although businesses such as Campanelli's typically receive no warning= =20 that they are about to lose power, insurance companies count the rolling=20 blackouts as ""planned events,"" a determination that in most cases=20 disqualifies a business from making a claim. ?????""I know it must be frustrating for businesses who have the power go of= f=20 suddenly, but these outages are planned by the grid operators,"" said Pete= =20 Moraga of the Insurance Information Network of California. ""That means it= =20 would not be a covered peril in a traditional business insurance policy."" ?????Typically, business insurance covers loss of profit and damage from=20 unforeseen events such as fires or windstorms.

But with nearly 100 stores in California, company President= =20 Eric Schiffer believes it is only a matter of time before the lights go out= =20 at one of its outlets. ?????Though the stores have some backup power, the chain has systems in pla= ce=20 to operate without it.

Krapels, a consultant helping major=20 Northeastern utilities, such as Consolidated Edison, design market-hedging= =20 programs, adamantly decried what he said are facile comparisons between=20 conditions in New York and California, there being ""more differences than= =20 there are similarities"" between those two industrial cornerstones of the=20 country's economy in respect to energy security management.=20 ""First of all, New York has a more varied portfolio of energy generation=20 sources than California,"" he said.

With no major new generating plants in downstate= =20 New York fully approved, the gap is expected to continue to widen. To avoid= =20 ""a replication of California's market meltdown"" the New York ISO calculates= =20 the state's daily generating capacity needs to grow by 8,600 MW by 2005, wi= th=20 more than half of that located in New York City and on Long Island.=20 Expressing concern this may be too big a burden for the current bureaucrati= c=20 process to bear, the ISO wants to see a state-appointed ombudsman named to= =20 help would-be merchant power plant investors plow through red tape.=20 ""Increasing New York's generating capacity will also lessen the state's=20 escalating and risky reliance on out-of-state sources of electricity,"" the= =20 ISO added. ""Since 1999, New York State has been unable to cover its reserve= =20 requirements from in-state sources.""=20 Not everyone agrees with that analysis, insofar as it argues for circling t= he=20 wagons inward.

Legislative Status Report Week Ending 2/23 Date: 2/23/01 To: Jan Smutny-Jones, Steven Kelly, Katie Kaplan Cc: IEP Board of Directors From: Julee Malinowski-Ball, Edson + Modisette RE: Legislative Status Report Week Ending 2/23 RECENT EVENTS: -- The week started off on a very positive note. Monday was a holiday! Tuesday, however, inevitably came along to spoil all the fun with last minute committee hearing announcements for some significant bills. -- SB 39x (Speier) was heard this week in the Senate Energy Committee. Thi= s measure would define owners or operators of any electric generating facilit= y as a public utility subject to the state=01,s jurisdiction. The bill also places the CPUC in the role of determining scheduled maintenance outages fo= r generation units. Although the bill goes much further, the author=01,s onl= y intention is to give the CPUC a role in coordinating power plant outages, but seems to not understand the implications of doing it in the manner outlined in the bill. IEP opposed the bill and testified to that end along with CMTA, the State Chamber of Commerce, Enron, WSPA, and the California Cogeneration Council. The usual cast of consumer groups supported the bill= . Of particular note during the hearing was the hostility shown to the opposition by the Chair of the Committee, Senator Bowen. The message from the opposition clearly was ignored by the majority of the members as it passed out of the committee on a party-line vote. IEP is currently reassessing its strategy on this particular issue because this is not the only bill that proposes similar changes. -- The Assembly Natural Resources Committee, chaired by Asm. Howard Wayne, was scheduled this week to hear two siting bills. The first was AB 34x (La Suer), which would make various changes to the CEC siting process, includin= g some IEP-sponsored language. IEP has a support if amended position on the bill which has some technical and policy problems, but workable. Last minute amendments offered by Asm. Keeley forced Asm. La Suer to postpone a hearing on the bill until next Monday (2/26). However, because the Keeley amendments basically gut the current language and turn it into a study bill= , La Suer is unlikely to accept them and, according to the negative committee analysis, the committee is unlikely to approve the measure in its current form. AB 36x (Wright), on the other hand, passed the Natural Resources committee with only one =01&no=018 vote. AB 36x would provide expedited siting for a repower project, as defined. However, despite IEP=01,s efforts to get the = bill amended, the current language would help few, if any, repower projects. Th= e author has agreed to continue working with us, the environmental community and the CEC to develop language that works for everyone. IEP=01,s major is= sue at this point is that is should actually work. The measure was double referred to the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee and will b= e heard there next. -- The negotiated language on the QF issue finally has a vehicle, SB 47x (Battin). All stakeholders are not united in their complete support for th= e measure. IEP has may need some additional changes but will be mobilizing members on Monday to educate Senators on the bill and support the measure i= n the Senate Energy Committee when it is scheduled for a hearing. Both SCE and WSPA also have some outstanding issues, but only WSPA so far will be opposing the bill. -- SB 6x (Burton), which would establish and state power and financing authority, passed off the Senate Floor 24 to 14 this week and is headed to the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee next.

I hope you are well - I KNOW you are busy! I just have a couple of matters for your attention: 1. We, as part of a group of Northwest IOUS, are exploring the possibility of retaining former Montana Governor Racicot to work BPA issues on our behalf. PGE will continue with Mike Andrews as our lobbyist but Racicot would work for the IOUs as a group. Does this cause you any concerns? Incidentally, we may step up our efforts somewhat in the general area of BPA because of the situation out here. Please let me know if I or Mike should be coordinating what we do with any of your folks in DC. 2. One of the major Northwest issues is who will be the next BPA Administrator. For a variety of reasons, there really aren't any good candidates from the Northwest and we're probably all to close to the situation anyway. I was wondering if the Enron net could come up with any good ideas for someone with good energy and policy experience from outside the Northwest? Someone who would appeal to the Bush administration? 3. With the delay in closing our sale to Sierra, we would very much like the ability to use Enron Online for trading. I believe we can get the regulatory approvals necessary but apparently when we raised this some months ago, there was strong opposition from within Enron, particularly Joe Hartsoe. Do you see an issue with pursuing this? How do you suggest I move this forward? Thanks, Steve. As you may hear from time to time, things are going well here in Oregon.

However, in the California proceeding we are also afforded the opportunity in the Order to offset our receivables against any refund that would otherwise have to be paid by us. Also, to the extent that our receivables exceed the refund amount, the Order provides for payment of interest to us in accordance with CFR Section 35.19a. At present, I am aware of the existence of three receivables. As you will recall, I mentioned at Tuesday's meeting that we should be able to treat as a receivable for purposes of offset, the revenues due us from the application of the CAISO underscheduling penalty. I communicated the possibility of offsetting this receivable against any potential refund at this mornings Western Wholesale conference call, and subsequent research conducted by Alan Comnes indicates that the CAISO owes us $30MM, as per the CAISO's own numbers. The CAISO also owes us approximately $40MM due to nonpayment for one to two months of business. These two figures alone, totalling approximately $70MM, exceed the estimate of our potential exposure in the California proceeding. Finally, the negative CTC issue is another receivable due us by IOU's that, under the plain language of the Order, could potentially be used to offset any refund amount. I am not aware of the magnitude of this receivable but do understand that there are some sensitivities regarding this issue, including concerns about revealing the amount of the credit due us. It is likely that the amount would become public if it is presented in the California proceeding. Please give us your thoughts as to the use of the CTC receivable to offset potential refunds in the California proceeding.",Company Business/Strategy

Sellers are exporting power from California to the Northwest. gas -- balance of the month gas in California was trading at $26-27 with Jan trading at $19, feb at $12-14 and Summer at $8. The Cal gas and power utilities remain unhedged (price caps are in place for retail power and utilities continue to buy power from the ISO and PX while gas utilities, we believe, are primarily buying at spot prices even under their long term deals). The power utilities will continue to book large deferrals and gas utilities will be passing costs through a month or two after incurring them. The impact of the gas price increases will begin showing up in Jan billings to consumers. curtailment rules (gas): More work to be done here, but it appears that gas utilities will curtail deliveries in the following order: interruptible first (with some priority for cogens); firm service (with utilities alternating or rolling between generation load and nongeneration load); and core customers last.

<2269600.1075849299729.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,,"FYI. From today's Post. Davis seems to continue to put distance between himself and the contracts. Best, Jeff Financial California Changes Stance on Refunds; Two Sides Far Apart In Energy Talks Peter Behr ? 07/06/2001 The Washington Post FINAL Page E01 Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity , saying they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43 billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year. Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term contracts, whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for Davis. ""We've made suggestions, we've offered various ways in which people could get us $8.9 billion,"" Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday. ""You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you want to do it, it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion."" The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr., according to sources close to the negotiations. Yesterday, Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach a compromise. ""What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood,"" Wagner told reporters. ""In the event we're unable to do that, [Friday] at some point I may offer a preliminary assessment."" The settlement conference is set to conclude on Monday. Wagner, FERC's chief administrative judge, has been trying to push both sides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy. Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California 's largest utility, drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on. Last Friday, Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative, Michael Kahn, chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in refunds from power generators and marketers was too high, sources said. Wagner's settlement conference, which has involved more than 100 lawyers for all sides, is closed to the public and media. Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda, and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a ""joke"" that the parties might as well wear ""clown suits,"" according to a Dow Jones report confirmed by sources close to the talks. But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers, led by Reliant Energy Inc., Williams Energy Services, Duke Energy and Southern Co., for failing to make serious settlement offers, these sources said. The suppliers have offered to refund $600 million, provided the state is able to call off various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds, sources said. Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds, but now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California 's electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher refund figure, some energy analysts believe. Davis's tactical change, offering to make the long-term contracts part of an overall settlement, comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have to pay for energy under those deals. California 's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed deregulation plan, which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at volatile ""spot market"" prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer, so did the state's electricity bills. In response, Davis's aide, S. David Freeman, and his staff began negotiating long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years. That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was paying at the beginning of this year, but above current power prices -- and considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade, energy analysts say. A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count as a ""refund"" because the deals were reached ""under commercial duress,"" according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations. Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify. ""There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be,"" said Michael Zenger, California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a ""just and reasonable"" standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit, the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure. ""It's not rocket science, but it does require the regulators to regulate,"" said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight committee for the California grid. Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room ""billions of dollars apart,"" as the talks approached their final weekend, sources said.",Company Business/Strategy

Donnelly could lead to a= =20 mass exodus by hundreds of small energy producers that have been selling=20 power to the state's financially troubled utilities for months without=20 getting paid. ?????At the same time, it may have staved off plans by a group of the small= =20 generators to send Edison into involuntary bankruptcy as early as today. ?????In Sacramento, energy legislation pushed by Gov. Gray Davis passed in= =20 the state Senate but foundered in the Assembly. The measure was intended to= =20 ensure that the state gets repaid for the electricity that it has been buyi= ng=20 on behalf of Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric, which say they lack the cas= h=20 and credit to purchase power. The bill also was supposed to guarantee that= =20 the small, alternative energy producers--which together provide nearly a=20 third of the state's power--get paid. But Assembly Republicans opposed it,= =20 saying it hadn't been given sufficient scrutiny. ?????The impact of the small producers was made clear in Imperial County,= =20 where Edison's failure to pay CalEnergy, the county's biggest property=20 taxpayer, had outsize implications. CalEnergy had put county officials on= =20 notice that it was about to miss a $3.8-million property tax payment. The= =20 uncertainty had prompted the tiny Calipatria Unified School District to=20 postpone a bond issue for badly needed school repairs. ?????Among CalEnergy Chairman David Sokol's first acts after the judge's=20 ruling Thursday was to promise Imperial County Supervisor Wally J. Leimgrub= er=20 that the company would pay its property taxes on time. ?????""That is great news,"" Leimgruber said. ?????Within hours of its court victory, CalEnergy had stopped transmitting= =20 geothermal power to Edison and begun selling it to El Paso Energy, a=20 marketing company that purchased the energy at prevailing rates and resold = it=20 on the spot market. ?????Some of the more than 700 other small energy producers in the state sa= id=20 they were considering similar action against Edison and Pacific Gas &=20 Electric. ?????""We absolutely need the right to sell to third parties,"" said Dean=20 Vanech, president of Delta Power, a New Jersey company that owns five small= =20 gas-fired plants in California and is owed tens of millions of dollars by= =20 Edison. ?????Sokol praised the Imperial County judge and said his company simply=20 wanted the authority to sell its power ""to a credit-worthy company that, in= =20 fact, pays for the power."" ?????An Edison spokesman said the company was disappointed with the ruling,= =20 but sympathized with CalEnergy and other small producers because=20 ""California's power crisis has placed [them] in financial distress, just as= =20 it has placed utilities in financial distress."" ?????Edison expressed concern that the ruling would prompt CalEnergy and=20 other small producers to sell their power out of state. Sokol said CalEnerg= y=20 had specifically told El Paso Energy that it hoped its power would remain i= n=20 California, ""but if someone wants to pay a higher price out of state, we=20 can't stop them."" ?????Sokol said that Edison still owes CalEnergy $140 million and that the= =20 company--along with seven other small producers--had been prepared to file = a=20 petition in federal bankruptcy court in Los Angeles today forcing the utili= ty=20 into involuntary bankruptcy. He said his company no longer intends to do so= ,=20 and he believed--but wasn't certain--that the other companies would shelve= =20 their plans. ?????Edison filed papers Thursday with the federal Securities and Exchange= =20 Commission showing that it owed $840 million to various small electricity= =20 producers, many of which rely on renewable energy sources such as geotherma= l=20 steam, solar energy or wind. ?????The alternative energy producers--and utilities--strenuously objected = to=20 the legislation considered in Sacramento on Thursday. The bill, spelling ou= t=20 how the utilities are to pay the state and the small producers, passed the= =20 Senate on a 27-9 vote, the exact two-thirds margin required. But it stalled= =20 in the Assembly on a 46-23 party-line vote, well short of two-thirds. ?????""When I was a citizen back in Lancaster, I heard these stories about= =20 pieces of legislation that were cooked up late at night, that . . . were cu= t=20 and pasted together and were rammed through by the Legislature,"" Assemblyma= n=20 George Runner (R-Lancaster) said.

""It is a very simple question: Dollars= =20 going out cannot be greater than dollars coming in."" ?????The bill, AB 8X, combined several proposals. First, it sought to clari= fy=20 earlier legislation by spelling out that Edison and PG&E must pay the state= =20 all money collected from consumers for electricity that the state has been= =20 buying. ?????Additionally, the bill would turn over to the California Public=20 Utilities Commission the thorny issue of how much to pay alternative energy= =20 producers for their electricity. ?????Wind, solar and geothermal producers might agree to the prices offered= =20 by the administration.

<22875583.1075853220482.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"SCE Counter Claim -- Underreporting of Volumes -- Confidential --
	 Attorney Work Product","After speaking with George Phillips yesterday about SCE's counterclaim against EES and EEMC regarding underreporting of usage to the ISO, I think there may be some internal confusion (of which I may have contributed to) about the nature of SCE's counterclaim. As I understand, from my review of certain documents received from SCE in response to our data requests, review of an ""Executive Summary"" prepared by George Phillips on the issue, and from my conversation with him yesterday, EES and EEMC, as a result of some problems with their settlement system, did indeed underreport customers' usage to the ISO during the time period claimed by SCE. This has, I believe, resulted in two separate (although interrelated) points of contention with SCE -- of which only one is the subject matter of its counterclaim. First, the underreporting resulted in Unaccounted For Energy (UFE) charges to the market. In correspondence sent by SCE to EEMC and EES during the last quarter of 2001, it appears that SCE was calculating the ""cost to the market"" from the EES/EEMC underreporting by applying the hourly day ahead market clearing price to the individual hourly variances. This cost to the market is overestimated, however, as SCE failed to take into account the fact that the ISO nets underreported amounts against overreported accounts to get a net amount of underreporting. This underreported amount is then allocated to all providers of physical load within a service territory through the assessment of UFE charges. Thus whatever the ultimate cost was determined to be, SCE would not be allocated the entire amount. Second, the underreporting of usage to the ISO results, according to SCE, in SCE paying EES and EEMC a PX credit for energy they never purchased. This claim is separate and apart from what SCE claims EES/EEMC cost the market in the way of UFE charges. What SCE is saying is that it believes that EES and EEMC only purchased on behalf of their customers the amount of energy which they reported to the ISO. EES' and EEMC's customers actually used more than the amount which EES and EEMC reported. SCE calculated the PX credit based on the amount used, not reported. It is SCE's claim that EES and EEMC are not entitled to a PX credit on the delta as the market, not EES and EEMC, purchased those volumes. It is only the second point of contention which is the subject matter of SCE's counterclaim. SCE is alleging that it should not have to pay a PX credit to EES and EEMC for volumes that EES and EEMC did not purchase. SCE is claiming that we only purchased the amount we reported to the ISO. While SCE may believe that it should not have to pay any UFE charges as the result of EES/EEMC underreporting, the UFE charges are not the basis of its counterclaim. Based on the above analysis, I think that the most critical piece of information to refute the counterclaim is that, despite the underreporting of volumes to the ISO, EES and EEMC actually purchased on behalf of their DA customers those customers' full usage. Can we make such claim? and do we have data to back it up? Jeanne Bennett",Company Business/Strategy

All rights reserved. Copyright Cato Institute Spring 2001 THE FINAL WORD CALIFORNIA IS IN THE MIDST OF AN ENORmous stupidity crisis. Californians have been sitting in the dark because ... they didn't turn the lights on. They say they're short of electricity. Yes, they are. Between 1988 and 1998, California's electricity consumption increased by 15 percent. Meanwhile California's capacity to generate electricity shrank by five percent, even as the state hesitated to build new power lines to tap into neighboring states' power supplies. Californians didn't want dams across their rivers, derricks on their ocean, power lines across their borders, or fossil fuel smoke in their sky. These might interfere with all the smart things Californians do, such as hang-glide. California was going to rely on ""negawatts"" - dramatic power conservation. (But California regulators put price controls on electricity that lowered prices, and even Californians weren't dumb enough to skip a bargain.) And California was going to rely on alternative power generation. With all the puffery from Silicon Valley dot.com start-ups, wind farms wouldn't be a problem. And doesn't Gwyneth Paltrow's star shine bright enough to operate a solar panel? But it turns out that alternative power generation is an alternative, mostly, to generating power. Californians are people who insist on growing their own vegetables, but they won't dig up the pretty lawn, won't plant anything for fear of getting dirty, and they use fragrant bath salts from The Body Shop instead of smelly compost. Let them make their crudites with crab grass. President Bush was wrong to grant an extension of executive orders requiring out-of-state utilities to supply power to California. And everyone is wrong to listen to Californians whine about electricity deregulation. There never was any deregulation. The California Public Utilities Commission merely changed its regulations, which apparently weren't stupid enough to meet Golden State standards. Under California's 1996 re-regulation plan, electric companies sold their generating plants and became distributors. They were required to buy their power on the wholesale spot market and forbidden to enter into any long-term power supply contracts. Retail electricity prices were lowered by 10 percent and frozen at the new rate until March 2002. This is like requiring A&P to sell you porterhouse at $2 a pound, no matter what the price of beef on the hoof. Imagine how many steaks there would be, and how many supermarkets. Go to one of those boarded-up grocery stores, purchase a phantom T-bone, screw it into a ceiling fixture, and try to light your house. You're in California. Californians devised a system of electricity sales that ignored every dimension of the free market. (Interesting that the ""Information Economy"" is centered in a place that's immune to information.) The free market is a yardstick, and Californians got smacked with it. Mideast oil jitters, cold weather, natural gas price spikes, and the plain unpredictable freedom of the free market caused wholesale electricity costs to rise and California utilities to go $12 billion into the red. California's governor Gray Davis responded with the full force of bikini beach brain. In a January 8 speech to the state legislature, Davis proposed creating a state agency to buy generating plants and build new ones. He threatened to expropriate power generators and transmission grids. He called for laws to allow criminal prosecution of wholesale suppliers who withheld electricity from California markets. And he said the state's universities and community colleges would build co-generating plants and become energy independent. (With gas produced by the cafeteria food?) Gray Davis sounded like Joseph Stalin with the IQ of Keanu Reeves. ""Everyone should understand that there are other, more drastic measures that I am prepared to take if I have to,"" Davis declaimed. ""Take"" is the key word. Grabby Californians tried to regulate themselves into some cheap electricity. Hoggish California power companies went along because the stateimposed retail price ceiling was also a retail price floor. According to the Los Angeles Times, during the first 28 months of the scheme, Pacific Gas and Electric and California Edison made $20 billion from the legally required mark-up between wholesale and retail electric prices. Californians want to snatch that money back. ""Consumer advocates around California... said it did not matter that the utilities were returning investments to their shareholders,"" reported the January 31 Washington Post. ""They took the money and ran,"" said state senator John Burton. As opposed to Californians, who took the electricity and roller-bladed? Now the juice and the jack are both gone, and the California legislature has had to pass a bill authorizing $10 billion to try to clean up the mess. But the Californians could still pull a scam. The bill mandates long-term power contracts at rates that are way above what future prices should be. The hope, one guesses, is that Congress, or the President, or somebody will let the state skip out on those contracts once the costs are lower. It would be wrong to call Californians stupid. They're sleazy, too. R J. O'Rourke is the Cato Institute's H. L. Mencken Research Fellow and is foreign affairs desk chief for Rolling Stone.

What are the provisions? ---------------------- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/NA/Enron on 09/01/2000 08:27 AM --------------------------- From: Ann M Schmidt 09/01/2000 07:57 AM To: Karen Denne/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Mark Palmer/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron, Meredith Philipp/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Subject: California Lawmakers Vote to Limit Power Costs - WSJ F.Y.I. California Lawmakers Vote to Limit Power Costs By Rebecca Smith 09/01/2000 The Wall Street Journal Page A4 (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) California lawmakers voted to extend modest relief to San Diego residents burdened with high electricity bills and set the groundwork for faster construction of badly needed power plants. They stopped short, however, of passing legislation that would roll back retail power rates to levels seen prior to deregulation . Late Wednesday, lawmakers sent a bill to Gov. Gray Davis that limits to 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour the amount that small customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Co. can be charged. The utility is allowed to add power-delivery and other reasonable costs to that commodity price. The price, equivalent to a bulk power cost of $65 per megawatt hour, is far higher than the average price of power for 27 of the 31 months in which California's market has been deregulated. But in June and July, the average price of power obtained by the utility from a state-sanctioned energy auction rose to 12 cents and 10.5 cents, respectively, compared with the 2.3 cents and 2.8 cents charged in those months a year earlier. Passed directly through to customers,the resulting bills sparked a near mutiny. The rate-cap measure applies to residential and small commercial customers, as well as to schools and hospitals. In addition to the rate cap, which can be adjusted upward or downward by the California Public Utilities Commission until December 2002, the legislature earmarked $150 million of general-fund revenue, which can be used to subsidize San Diego power costs if they greatly exceed the 6.5-cents-per-kilowatt-hour rate. For now, the utility would be expected to make up any difference between revenue collected and the actual cost. Steve Baum, chairman of Sempra Energy, parent of San Diego Gas & Electric Co., said the rate-cap measure is ""deeply flawed"" because it limits the amount prices can rise but sets no floor. That means any shortfall could grow -- without a mechanism for customers to pay it down -- until the end of the rate-cap period, which could last until December 2002 or December 2003. Mr. Baum said Sempra stands to suffer an undercollection of perhaps $664 million, provided future prices approximate the New York Mercantile Exchange forward prices through December 2002. ""It's irreparably damaging to Sempra,"" he said because it ""creates tremendous uncertainty"" that makes it hard for the San Diego energy company to finance new projects such as a new transmission line. The legislature also appeared likely to approve a bill speeding up the permit process for the construction of new power plants, in part by beefing up staffs of regulatory agencies that review the plans.

<6918276.1075862382449.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,Talking Points For Rep. Barton On Tauzin RTO Letter,"Linda requested some background and talking points on the pending RTO letter from Chairman Tauzin to FERC that is sitting on Chairman Barton's desk TODAY for his decision whether to co-sign the letter. While we have not seen the text, we are told that it is ""anti-RTO"" and may go so far as to state or imply that FERC does not have authority to do what is doing with RTOs. (We know this is the view of one of Chairman Tauzin's counsels, who formerly worked for Southern Co.). Chairman Tauzin has been contacted by Entergy and the Louisiana Public Service Commission to send the letter. I spoke to Chairman Barton's staff, Andy Black, this afternoon and relayed our concerns. The Barton Subcommittee is now expected to mark up an electricity bill in December (per a Republican Member meeting held this morning). ACTION ITEM: Call Rep. Joe Barton (202/225-2002) TALKING POINTS: 1. Should start with something about the Dynegy/Enron transaction (it will be strange if Mr. Lay or Steve calls Chairman Barton and does not start the conversation with some reference to the transaction). 2. Mentioning the transaction naturally leads into the importance of competitive wholesale markets for power, both for consumers and for the largely Texas-based marketing, trading and merchant power industries. 3. We understand that Chairman Barton has been approached by Chairman Tauzin about a letter to FERC on the RTO issue. We know Chairman Barton is well aware of Enron's strong support for FERC's RTO initiatives. We respect Chairman Barton's interest in seeing to it that Congress does not abdicate its responsibility to make energy policy. 4. If, as we have been lead to believe, the letter states or implies that FERC does not have authority to act in the RTO arena, this will be seen as a potentially destabilizing development since FERC is so far down the road of creating RTOs. 5. While we understand some in Congress and elsewhere were concerned that FERC was moving too fast, as of the last FERC meeting earlier this month, that is no longer true even if it ever was true. While we think RTOs should be created sooner rather than later, FERC is listening to state regulators and others who had concerns. 6. A letter from congressional leaders questioning FERC's authority goes too far in the direction of those who oppose any RTOs. Furthermore, it is wrong as a matter of law. The D.C. Circuit held in the gas cases and in the power cases on Order 888 that FERC has authority to address systemic discrimination, which is in large part what the RTOs are all about -- a remedy for iscrimination.",Company Business/Strategy

Basically the value that GSS has brought to the bottom line during the last year has been minimal to ETS. The reasons for that statement, in my opinion, are: * The materials and services that ETS purchase are basic and routine. * Most of those materials and service providers were identified and sourced during 1999 and 2000. * ETS is reaching the point where we need fewer providers, not more. * New items identified are normally rolled into one of our already sourced NPA's. * Almost all large dollar items are bid out (three bids and a buy). * GSS's involvement and commitment to the deal ends with the contract signing. * ETS P&SM organization and our Contracts services group deals with the actual execution and the ringing of the cash register. If the GSS organization went away tomorrow, we would need the following expertise brought over from their group: (currently this group is close to 75 people.)(and very highly paid individuals) * Two (2) negotiators - Contract Managers * Two (2) analysts * Two (2) contract administrators The administration of the following services would need to be shifted to the ISC: * iBuyit System * Catalog system (part of iBuyit) * iPayit system We would need to re-assess the value of the contract with SourceNet and whether we continue down that path or implement our own A/P department.

Donna sent me this quick write up about what she has looked into so far. Because these questions go beyond a FERC practitioner's expertise, we asked Donna to work with a Constitutional Law expert at V&E to determine whether, and under what circumstances, the President's authority may be extended beyond the authorities discussed in the memo. We will let you know what we learn from that further research.

I read an interesting law review article on ""The Imposition of Martial Law in the United States,"" for a discussion of presidential powers. There is no general emergency authority granted the President in the U.S. Constitution. Also, the article discussed the famous ""Truman steel mills case,"" Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952), in which the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional President Truman's seizure of the steel mills during the Korean War. In that case, in light of a threatened national-wide strike in the national steel industry, President Truman, concerned about the national defense, issued an Executive Order directing the Secretary of Commerce to take possession of most of the steel mills and keep them running. The Supreme Court said that if the President had authority to take such an action, he had to derive it either from an act of Congress or the Constitution itself. Since the Supreme Court could not find any seizure authority, it invalidated the President's action. The Supreme Court also rejected the argument that the President had any powers that could be implied from the aggregate of his powers under the Constitution. Based on the Truman steel mills case, I thought it the wiser course of action to look for specific authorities given to the President by statute which might prove useful. I could look into this question further, if you would like, but we would be entering ""martial law-type"" legal territory, where the President would be acting outside of specific Constitutional or congressional authority (which has been described a ""zone of twilight""), and in light of the Truman steel mills case, I don't know how fruitful that might be.

 COMMUNICATION & ATTORNEY'S WORK PRODUCT","Stan: V&E wrote/masterminded the partnership agreement for our MLP. It is complicated and has been amended several times. In view of these factors, V&E should tell us whether we can use the $2.5 million of cash from the insurance recovery to retroactively reclaim a portion of the 4th quarter API's. In particular, Baird should give us this opinion since he has handled the partnership agreement since day one. Baird is gone on vacation for the next week. He is planning to give us an answer within a few days of his return. He will give the matter serious thought, but what we are asking is pretty aggressive. His associate, Carlos Pena, has reviewed the partnership agreement and his first take on the question is that we cannot revise the available cash for the fourth quarter in this way. But the matter requires far more thought than this----and Bob will also need to talk with Lori (also gone on vacation) to come up with a meaningful answer for us. I will stay after this, but in light of the above, it will probably be early July b/f we get V&E's final position on this.

For the benefit of those who were not on the call, I'd like to recap where things stand at this point. My apologies if I mischaracterize anyone's position. NPCC and ERCOT have signed the agreement. ECAR has stated it will sign the agreement at the signing ceremony on March 30. SPP is prepared to sign the agreement, but doesn't want to be the only one it its part of the Eastern Interconnection to do so. FRCC was not on the call, but has previously stated that it is prepared to sign so long as at least six regions sign. MAPP and MAIN have indicated that they prefer to develop their program with their own members before they sign the NERC agreement. WSCC may need to consider the matter at its Board meeting in early April. SERC has the matter under consideration. I have not heard from MAAC, but it has a meeting scheduling for March 29. I want to share with you my concern for the climate in Washington. In the past few weeks I have had occasion to speak with a number of people on Capitol Hill and in the new Administration. All are very concerned about what might happen this summer. If a serious incident occurs, I am quite sure that Congress will legislate very quickly--whether it will legislate wisely is a different question. We have the opportunity with this agreement for the industry to take charge of its own destiny. If Congress acts it may well assign a very central role to the Federal government to take direct responsibility for reliability. There are those in the Department of Energy who are pushing for such a role. Congressman Barton is talking of the possibility of emergency legislation, possibly within the next few weeks. If the industry pulls together, I believe we can forestall direct governmental controls, just as in 1965. If the industry does not step up, then Congress may well assign the responsibility elsewhere. The CTG recommended to the Board that a critical mass of six Regions sign onto the agreement before it goes forward. For those Regions that are considering developing their own programs with their members before they sign the agreement, with the view of having the CAPG determine in advance whether their programs meets the requirements of the agreement, I ask you to consider this: If we don't get a critical mass of Regions to sign, then the CAPG may not come into existence. The NERC/Regions agreement is really an undertaking by the regions to work to develop their own regional compliance and enforcement program with their members. My request remains that each of the regions sign the agreement by the March 30 Board meeting. That will assure that we are able to make the governance changes that we have all been working for. If any region is unable to sign by March 30, then use of the letter of intent would be a way to demonstrate support for the program. That may be enough to satisfy those who have stated that moving forward on the compliance program is a condition to their support of the governance changes. Thanks very much for your consideration of the program and all the work you've put into this transition so far. Please let me know if you have questions or if there is anything that we can do from here to be of assistance to you.",Company Business/Strategy

<11696503.1075842972482.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,Observations on the Hearings this Week,"We're in the process of developing a strategy to take us through the next few months. But while the (otherwise perishable) thoughts are still fresh in my mind from the hearings on Monday and Tuesday, I wanted to throw out some observations for discussion in the days/weeks ahead. OBSERVATION--The pressure to finger somebody for ""price gouging"" is increasing. The administration is hell bent on finding a ""fall guy."" The price spikes pose real political risks for Davis and he and his folks need and want an easy way out. His press release following the hearing renewed the call for ""refunds."" On my panel, Loretta Lynch asked Reliant and Duke to supply her with the details of the contracts they cut to sell their power forward to marketers. And Carl Wood's remarks were extreme. At the Barton hearing, a liberal democrat (Filner) and a conservative Republican (Hunter) locked arms in calling for refunds. Bilbray joined the ""gouging"" band wagon. The utilities repeatedly called on FERC to do a ""real"" investigation, with hearings, testimony, data discovery---the works. On the positive side, the FERC commissioners lauded Wolak, his analysis, and his remarks on the panel. Wolak said somewhat emphatically that the nature of California's market structure makes it impossible to single out a single participant as the culprit. He also stated that just everyone's just acting in their own self-interest, responding to the screwed incentives embedded in the structure. IMPLICATION--It seems prudent for Enron to understand better its risks of getting fingered. In the best case, the clamoring for a ""refund"" subsides. In which case, the only cost to Enron is the internal cost incurred to understand better the risks of getting fingered. In the medium case, investigations find that Enron (like others) ""played by the rules,"" but the rules stunk, and Enron profited at the expense of California consumers.",Company Business/Strategy

Business/Financial Desk; Section A Rival to Buy Enron, Top Energy Trader, After Financial Fall By ALEX BERENSON and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 11/10/2001 The New York Times=20 Page 1, Column 2 c. 2001 New York Times Company=20 With its stock plunging and its finances in doubt, the world's largest ener= gy trader, the Enron Corporation, agreed to be acquired yesterday by the ri= val Dynegy Inc. for about $9 billion in stock and the assumption of $13 bil= lion in debt.=20 The deal is an extraordinary turnabout for Enron, a Houston-based company t= hat had been a driving force behind electricity deregulation nationwide. Its chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, a big contributor to the Republican Party, pr= ovided political influence, while its former chief executive, Jeffrey K. Sk= illing, helped create markets for the trading of electricity and natural ga= s. But last winter, when California's effort to deregulate the electricity = market led to soaring power prices and rolling blackouts, Enron was the sub= ject of much criticism and political anger.=20 Recent disclosures of discrepancies in Enron's financial statements and an = investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission caused the shares t= o plunge this week to their lowest level in a decade. As other companies be= came wary of doing business with it, Enron -- also facing a potential cash = squeeze -- apparently had little choice but to find a buyer, and a deal was= hastily cobbled together this week.=20 For critics who had complained about Enron's market power and its dominance= , the combination poses additional concerns. Dynegy's acquisition of Enron = will be reviewed by state and federal agencies, led by the Justice Departme= nt and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Analysts said today that t= hey expected scrutiny of the combined companies' holdings in California, wh= ere Dynegy owns power-generating plants and Enron accounts for much of the = trading of natural gas -- fuel for the state's electric power plants.=20 Buying Enron at a deep discount -- it has lost $60 billion in market value = this year -- could make Dynegy the dominant trader of electricity and natur= al gas. But the agreement carries big risks as well. Along with Enron's gas= pipelines and high-technology trading floor, Dynegy will take on Enron's s= ubstantial debt and a web of complex transactions that Enron has spun over = the last decade.=20 In addition to the $13 billion in debt that Enron carries on its books, it = has guaranteed at least $4 billion in off-balance sheet loans, and the hidd= en debt could total as much as $10 billion, said Carol Coale, a stock analy= st with Prudential Securities.=20 Charles L. Watson, Dynegy's chairman and chief executive, said yesterday th= at Dynegy could sort through Enron's tangled finances. ''We know the compan= y well,'' Mr. Watson said. ''It's not like we just started fresh. I'm confi= dent that it's as solid as we thought it was.''=20 The new company will combine Enron's 25,000-mile natural gas pipeline syste= m with the large number of power plants that Dynegy owns worldwide, as well= as Illinois Power, a Dynegy subsidiary that serves 650,000 customers in Il= linois. But its most important asset will be its trading desk. It will be t= he largest energy trader in the nation, trading more than twice as much pow= er and natural gas as its closest competitors.=20 Mr. Watson said the company did not expect to sell significant properties a= nd that the deal should pass regulatory scrutiny. ''There's really not a lo= t of overlap in assets,'' he said.=20 Mr. Watson and Steve Bergstrom, Dynegy's president, will hold those positio= ns in the new company, which will be called Dynegy and remain in Houston. M= r. Lay, who created Enron in the mid-1980's, will not have any role in the = combined company's daily operations. He has been asked to join its board bu= t has not provided an answer. ''The last three weeks haven't been a lot of = fun,'' he said.=20 In a statement announcing the agreement yesterday afternoon, Mr. Watson sai= d he was confident that the merger would produce a strong new company. ''En= ron is the ideal strategic partner for Dynegy,'' Mr. Watson said. ''We will= keep a strong balance sheet and straightforward financial structure as key= priorities.''=20 To shore up Enron's finances, Dynegy will immediately put $1.5 billion into= Enron through ChevronTexaco, the giant oil company, which already owns 27 = percent of Dynegy. Another billion dollars will be injected once the deal i= s completed.=20 Investors appeared comfortable yesterday that Dynegy could make the deal wo= rk. After falling $3, to $33, on Wednesday, when the companies first said t= hey were in discussions, Dynegy rose $5.76 on Thursday and yesterday to clo= se the week at $38.76.=20 ''On paper, it works,'' Ms. Coale of Prudential said. ''The combined compan= y would be the leading trader, the market leader in most of their businesse= s.'' Ms. Coale, who has a sell rating on Enron and a buy rating on Dynegy, = said she planned to keep her buy rating on Dynegy.=20 As it works to have the deal approved, Dynegy will have to persuade Enron's= traders to stay with the combined company. The pain of the stock's 90 perc= ent plunge this year will not be equally shared. Some Enron employees have = held onto their shares and seen their retirement accounts eviscerated. Mean= while, Mr. Lay, Mr. Skilling and other former and current executives sold h= undreds of millions of dollars in Enron stock in 2000 and this year.=20 The companies also have very different corporate cultures. Dynegy emphasize= s teamwork, while Enron is more competitive, said Ehud Ronn, director of th= e Center for Energy Finance Education and Research at the University of Tex= as. Even before the merger was announced, Enron had lost some of its employ= ees to other energy trading companies, Mr. Ronn said.=20 Some investors and analysts say that the problems with Enron's finances may= extend beyond the partnerships that have been the subject of Wall Street's= scrutiny the last month. James Chanos, a short-seller who has been one of = Enron's most vocal critics, said there was increasing evidence that Enron's= energy trading operations were not as profitable as the company had said. = ''There appears to be a culture at Enron of aggressively booking profits an= d deferring or obscuring losses,'' Mr. Chanos said.=20 On Thursday, Enron said in a filing with the S.E.C that it had overstated i= ts earnings by almost $600 million over the last five years. Mr. Chanos sai= d more restatements were possible, noting that the filing disclosed partner= ships had been used to hedge almost $1 billion in losses in 2000 and this y= ear. So far, the losses from those partnerships remain off Enron's financia= l statements, Mr. Chanos said.=20 Enron's stock had been under pressure for most of this year, as the company= ran up large losses with failed efforts to expand outside its core trading= operation. In August, Mr. Skilling resigned as chief executive, and Mr. La= y resumed control of daily operations.=20 Still, the company appeared financially sound until last month, when it dis= closed that its shareholders' equity, a measure of the company's value, dro= pped by $1.2 billion because of deals disclosed only hazily in its financia= l statements. The announcement unnerved investors, who wondered whether Enr= on had found ways to inflate its profits and move debt off its balance shee= t, and led the S.E.C. to begin an investigation.=20 Mr. Lay tried to reassure investors that Enron's finances were in order and= that its businesses remained strong. But the last three weeks have brought= a series of damaging revelations about partnerships that Enron formed with= some of its top executives, including its former chief financial officer, = Andrew S. Fastow.=20 With questions mounting, the major credit-rating agencies began to downgrad= e Enron's debt, putting additional pressure on the company. If Enron's debt= rating falls below investment grade, it would be forced to repay $3.3 bill= ion in loans that it had guaranteed.=20 To strengthen its balance sheet and bolster its stock, Enron turned to big = investors like Warren E. Buffett in search of billions of dollars of financ= ing. When the financing did not quickly appear, its stock fell further.=20 By this week, some major energy traders were refusing to extend credit to E= nron, worrying that the company would be unable to make good on its contrac= ts. The Mirant Corporation, an Atlanta-based power plant owner and electric= ity trader, sharply curtailed its trading with Enron this week. ''We're tra= ding with them on a very limited basis,'' said James Peters, a Mirant spoke= sman. ''It's not business as usual.''=20 On Wednesday, Enron's stock fell as low as $7 a share, its lowest level in = more than a decade. That day, news of the Enron and Dynegy talks leaked out= .=20 By late Wednesday, the boards of the two companies had tentatively agreed t= o a deal. But Dynegy refused to go ahead until it learned whether Enron's c= redit rating would remain investment grade and was comfortable with the eff= ect of the deal on its own rating. The deal moved forward yesterday after D= ynegy was assured Enron's debt was not in danger of being lowered to junk s= tatus soon after the deal was announced, according to company officials.=20 Dynegy and Enron had provided Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Servi= ce, the main credit agencies, with statements showing them what a combined = company might look like and asked the ratings agencies for an expedited rev= iew of the transaction, Mr. Watson said.=20 Under the deal, Enron shareholders will receive 0.2685 share of Dynegy stoc= k for each Enron share, or $9.80 based on Dynegy's closing price on Thursda= y. Enron's stock gained 22 cents yesterday, to $8.63.=20 ''I never thought our stock price would be at this level,'' Mr. Lay said ye= sterday.=20 Enron's shareholders will own only 36 percent of the combined company, and = Dynegy will name at least 11 members of the company's 14-member board.=20 If the deal falls apart, Enron or Dynegy will have to pay a breakup fee of = $350 million.=20 To protect Dynegy's and ChevronTexaco's cash infusion, the money will go to= an Enron unit that owns the Northern Natural Gas Pipeline. If the merger i= s not completed, Dynegy will have the right to buy the unit.=20 An army of bankers and lawyers advised the companies. Lehman Brothers Inc. = acted as financial adviser and Baker Botts and Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &= Feld acted as counsel for Dynegy. J. P.

OPPEL Jr. 11/10/2001 The New York Times=20 Page 1, Column 2 c. 2001 New York Times Company=20 WASHINGTON, Nov. 9 -- For years, the Enron Corporation used its political m= uscle to build the markets in which it thrived, pushing relentlessly on Cap= itol Hill and in bureaucratic backwaters to deregulate the nation's natural= gas and electricity businesses.=20 Its achievement, as one Enron executive said today, in creating a ''regulat= ory black hole'' fit nicely with what he called the company's ''core manage= ment philosophy, which was to be the first mover into a market and to make = money in the initial chaos and lack of transparency.'' Now, Wall Street's dissatisfaction with Enron's secretive ways has delivere= d the company into the arms of its much smaller Houston rival, Dynegy Inc.,= in a deal worth about $9 billion in stock and the assumption of $13 billio= n in debt. The combination of the two companies, energy experts and lawmake= rs said today, poses a novel set of challenges for regulators still struggl= ing to grasp the complexities of the marketplace that Enron invented.=20 ''We're in a supersonic-speed era of electronic trading with a horse-and-bu= ggy-era regulatory system to protect consumers,'' said Representative Edwar= d J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who has devised legislation to close = the regulatory gap.=20 Dynegy's acquisition of Enron is expected to be reviewed by numerous state = and federal agencies, led by the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Comm= ission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.=20 Analysts said today that sharp scrutiny would be given to the combined comp= anies' holdings in California, where Dynegy owns generating plants and Enro= n controls a large part of the market for trading natural gas -- the fuel f= or a big share of the state's electric power plants.=20 ''Dynegy would now have a greater ability to take the dominant position in = gas and raise the price of electricity,'' said Frank Wolak, a professor of = economics at Stanford University.=20 Mr. Wolak, a consultant to the Justice Department on a 1999 antitrust case = that led to limits on another merger of electricity and natural gas compani= es in Southern California, said he was skeptical that regulators were up to= the task of reviewing today's deal.=20 The transaction ''is something the Department of Justice needs to look at, = and they are going to have a hard time looking at,'' Mr. Wolak said. ''And = it's beyond the ability of the F.E.R.C. to look at.''=20 Pat Wood -- named chairman of the federal energy commission earlier this ye= ar with the backing of Kenneth L. Lay, the chairman of Enron -- acknowledge= d in an interview today that the agency had ''a long way to go'' in matchin= g the sophistication of the companies it regulates.=20 But he said that the commission had made great strides in grappling with th= e new risk management techniques pioneered by Enron, Dynegy and other energ= y companies. It is hiring more experts, he said, adopting more restrictive = rules on how much ''market power'' one party can control and requiring more= disclosure of certain energy transactions.=20 In an interview this evening, Charles L. Watson, the chairman of Dynegy, sa= id he did not believe that regulators reviewing the deal with Enron would r= equire the sale of any assets. ''We haven't really identified any pitfalls = that require any sort of asset divestiture,'' he said. ''There's not really= any overlap.''=20 A senior executive at one of Enron's largest energy-trading rivals disagree= d. ''I don't think this deal gets through unscathed,'' he said today. ''I'm= sure the Justice Department and the F.T.C. will look closely at the pretty= substantial concentration of market power these companies will have in the= energy-trading area.''=20 Enron is mainly a trader of natural gas and electricity -- indeed, the bigg= est player in both those markets -- and it also owns a network of gas pipel= ines. Dynegy processes and sells natural gas and generates and sells electr= icity. Each company owns a local electric utility, too: Dynegy owns Illinoi= s Power in Decatur, Ill., while Enron owns Portland General Electric in Por= tland, Ore., but last month announced plans to sell it to another Oregon ut= ility.=20 For a decade, as it transformed itself from a gas pipeline operator into th= e nation's biggest energy trader, Enron enjoyed unalloyed lobbying success = in Washington and the enthusiastic backing of Wall Street.=20 In the early months of the Bush administration, Mr. Lay -- whose company wa= s one of the biggest financial backers of George W. Bush's presidential cam= paign -- played a prominent, and some said unusual, role in helping the Whi= te House pick nominees to the federal energy commission. Enron executives m= et with Vice President Dick Cheney, whose energy task force backed many of = the deregulatory initiatives pushed by Mr. Lay.=20 Now, ''the company has become a pariah,'' an Enron executive said today. ''= The Bush administration doesn't want to have anything to do with us.''=20 The problems began with the energy crisis in California, where Enron's outs= poken defense of deregulation, even more than its electricity trading activ= ities, made the company a favorite whipping boy of politicians and consumer= advocates. In the financial markets, meanwhile, Enron's confusing disclosu= res, tolerated when its stock was soaring, drew disdain as the calming of t= he energy storms in California and other parts of the country beat the shar= es down, starting last spring.=20 ''Enron fell victim to their own inconsistencies on transparency,'' Mr. Wol= ak said. As California officials sought to understand why energy prices had= soared out of control, he said, Enron's ''view was that we want everybody'= s data, but if you want ours, get a subpoena.''=20 Energy executives and regulators said that sort of arrogance had long marke= d Enron's attitude about government oversight.=20 Electricity sales had for decades been the job of local utility companies, = operating as monopolies and selling power at regulated rates within their s= ervice areas. A few entrepreneurs, led by Mr. Lay, conceived a different mo= del in which power could be sold by generators or middlemen to big corporat= e users or utilities in faraway regions, at whatever price the market would= bear.=20 In the early 1990's, Congress -- under heavy lobbying by Enron -- passed le= gislation that began to open up electricity sales to marketers. Before long= , Enron became one of the first companies to receive government approval to= sell electricity at market rates. The market for interstate sales of natur= al gas had been freed up a few years earlier, and critics complained that t= raders like Enron were gleaning their profits by stoking volatility in gas = prices.=20 In the mid-1990's, independent gas producers backed legislation in Congress= to allow the creation of a co-operative marketing organization, which, the= y hoped, would have helped stabilize prices.=20 Raymond Plank, the chairman of the Apache Corporation, a gas producer based= in Houston, said that the big gas marketing and trading companies, includi= ng Enron, successfully lobbied to kill the plan, leaving prices as volatile= as ever.=20 ''It was a great concept,'' Mr. Plank said. ''We could have headed off the = problems we have today.''=20 Enron's final lobbying success came last year. With a strong push from the = company's lobbyists, Congress passed futures trading legislation that exemp= ted Internet energy trading platforms like EnronOnline, the industry leader= , from oversight by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Enron takes t= he other side of trades on its exchange. In traditional markets like the Ne= w York Mercantile Exchange, which remain subject to oversight, the exchange= acts as a middleman between buyers and sellers.=20 Under Mr. Watson, Dynegy has been less of a pathbreaker than Enron, and tho= ugh California politicians denounced it, too, as a profiteer during the ene= rgy crisis, most analysts say it has been less aggressive than Enron in bot= h its business practices and its lobbying.=20 Indeed, the rival energy-trading executive today predicted ''a huge culture= clash'' as the Houston neighbors merge. ''Blood will flow in Houston over = the integration of the trading operation,'' he said.=20 But regulators may find Dynegy easier to deal with.=20 Earlier this year, the federal energy commission asked for comments on whet= her it should tighten scrutiny of dealings between natural gas pipelines an= d energy-trading shops owned by the same company.=20 Enron wondered what all the bother was. ''Would stricter rules prevent real= affiliate abuse that current rules do not,'' it wrote in a regulatory fili= ng, ''or would they instead merely restrict the activities of some of the m= ore successful participants in the marketplace?''=20 Dynegy, by contrast, painted a grim picture and invited regulators to crack= down. ''Abuses abound,'' it said, ''because of financial windfalls, diffic= ulty of detection, lengthy investigations and increased complexity of the m= arket.'' =20 Report on Business: Canadian Dynegy to buy troubled rival Enron Reuter News Agency 11/10/2001 The Globe and Mail=20 Metro B4 ""All material Copyright (c) Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc. and its licenso= rs.

In only the last month, a series of disturbing financial revelations p= ushed to the edge of ruin this once-powerful company, whose top executives = had lectured California on its energy foibles and who influenced the direct= ion of national energy policy. Enron muscled its way to the top of the energy heap using aggressive and, i= n the end, financially suspect strategies that proved its undoing.=20 Now, the company that late last year had a market value of $63 billion is w= orth one-tenth that and has agreed to be swallowed by a cross-town competit= or one-quarter its size. Enron's proud and influential chairman and chief e= xecutive, Kenneth L. Lay, who became a focus of bitter attacks by Californi= a politicians and regulators, would lose his job, as would many others at E= nron.=20 Even the name would disappear. The combined company would be called Dynegy = Inc. if the deal receives all the necessary regulatory and shareholder appr= ovals.=20 California officials took no joy in Enron's fate Friday, though there was p= erhaps some sense of retribution from its many critics in the state.=20 ""This is basically a rogue corporation,"" said Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon)= , an outspoken critic of Enron for years who dealt with the company as he c= haired the committee that hammered out the legislative portion of Californi= a's landmark electricity deregulation plan in 1996. ""It has from the beginn= ing been a rogue corporation which answered in its mind to a higher law--a = fundamental belief that there are laws of economics that supersede the law = of the land.""=20 A Failed Experiment=20 Steve Maviglio, spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, said that although Enron was= never a major force in California's doomed electricity market, it was outs= poken in support of deregulation.=20 ""In a sense, their experiment was much like California's experiment--a fail= ure,"" he said.=20 Said Harvey Rosenfield, president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consum= er Rights in Santa Monica: ""Nothing could better illustrate the disaster of= deregulation than the fact that one of its biggest proponents, which reape= d the reward of deregulation, is suffering the consequences.""=20 Enron is the world's largest energy trader, handling one of four energy dea= ls in the United States through its online trading operation, EnronOnline. = Since it reported a surprising third-quarter loss on Oct. 16, partly tied t= o shadowy investment vehicles, Enron has endured a huge loss of investor co= nfidence, which brought on a massive cash crunch and some shrinkage of its = trading business.=20 Under the deal announced Friday, Dynegy, invited in two weeks ago after Enr= on fell short in its efforts to line up new financing, would immediately he= lp Enron by pouring $1.5 billion in cash into the company. The money would = be provided by ChevronTexaco Corp., the San Francisco oil company that owns= nearly 27% of Dynegy.=20 Enron shareholders would get 0.2685 Dynegy share for each Enron share, whic= h values the company at about $7.7 billion based on Friday's stock close. D= ynegy shares surged $2.26 to close at $38.76 per share on the New York Stoc= k Exchange; Enron added 22 cents to close at $8.63 per share, still off 89%= year to date.=20 If the deal closes in six to nine months, as the parties expect, Dynegy and= ChevronTexaco would invest $1 billion additionally in the combined company= .=20 ""This is just a financial bonanza really for both companies,"" said Charles = L. Watson, Dynegy chairman and chief executive, who will head the combined = company. Watson said the merger would immediately add to Dynegy's earnings.= =20 Even so, the repercussions of Enron's fall from grace could be far-reaching= . Coming on the heels of California's energy crisis, Enron's troubles may s= low the country's march toward energy deregulation, which Lay and Enron cha= mpioned for years as a potential boon to consumers and the economy in gener= al.=20 But the deal announced Friday will prevent an even worse outcome, energy ex= perts said: the threatened collapse of Enron, which would clog up for a tim= e the business of buying and selling electricity, natural gas and oil. That= could interfere with delivery of energy around the country, they said.=20 ""This is an encouraging development for the energy industry,"" said Stephen = Baum, chairman of Sempra Energy, the San Diego-based parent of Southern Cal= ifornia Gas and San Diego Gas & Electric. ""The Enron-Dynegy combination wil= l create a credit-worthy counter-party which will help preserve order in th= e marketplace. It also will reinforce confidence in the energy trading busi= ness going forward.""=20 But some in the industry are less pleased.=20 Raymond Plank, chairman of Apache Corp., a Houston-based natural gas explor= ation and development firm, said he is considering a motion to the Federal = Trade Commission against the proposed merger.=20 ""There are issues of concentration in a combination of the largest energy t= rader, Enron, and the fifth-largest, Dynegy,"" Plank said. ""California shoul= d be particularly concerned because Dynegy owns power plants there and Enro= n has pipelines and other interests.""=20 Troubles Mount as Stock Plunges=20 The swagger that was Enron is long gone. Consider:=20 * Enron's brash chief executive, Jeffrey K. Skilling, touted only months ag= o as one of the young stars of American business, abruptly resigned in Augu= st, citing personal reasons. Enron's stock already had fallen from its high= of nearly $90 per share as investments in water and telecommunications tur= ned sour, a fact that contributed to Skilling's departure.=20 * The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched an investigation of E= nron's controversial dealings with a number of limited partnerships, some o= rganized and run by Enron managers, including Enron Chief Financial Officer= Andrew S. Fastow, who was ousted last month.=20 * In an extraordinary confession Thursday, Enron announced that it had over= stated profit by $586 million, or 20%, during the last five years. The earl= ier financial statements reported to Wall Street and the investing public, = Enron said, ""should not be relied upon.""=20 * The company also fired its treasurer and a corporate lawyer, both of whom= it said were investors in one of the limited partnerships. Yet some analys= ts questioned whether, even in its admission of accounting trickery, Enron = wasn't still holding something back.=20 * Credit-rating agencies, which already have downgraded Enron's bonds to ba= rely above ""junk"" status, continue to pore over Enron's books. Analysts hav= e said a further downgrade to the level of junk, or below investment grade,= could precipitate a crisis akin to a run on a bank and threaten Enron's su= rvival while the merger is pending.=20 With its stock crumbling and trading partners leery about its ability to pa= y its debts, Enron was forced to walk hat in hand down Houston's Energy All= ey to negotiate a saving takeover by Dynegy, the rival once jokingly dismis= sed as ""Enron Lite.""=20 In the trading markets where Enron still holds a leading but increasingly v= ulnerable position, other players already are stepping up to grab a bigger = share of the business. Even if Enron's trading operation survives more or l= ess intact, under the wing of a Dynegy or some other company, experts said = it may never regain its former level of dominance.=20 ""Enron has been a very innovative shop, willing to spend considerably to es= tablish new markets,"" said analyst Andre Meade of Commerzbank Securities in= New York. ""If that culture is not kept, everyone loses.""=20 Skilling and mentor Lay had worked for a decade to create both a new kind o= f company and a new set of markets for it to play.=20 In large part, they succeeded. Enron transformed itself from a traditional = gas pipeline company into a high-tech global trader of everything from elec= tricity to pollution credits to aluminum. The company's overarching strateg= y was to pare its physical assets to the minimum to get the maximum profit = bang from its intellectual capital: the ranks of MBAs and PhDs that filled = its Houston trading floor.=20 Rather than maintain its own expensive gas fields and power plants--which i= t relegated to stodgy utilities and oil companies--Enron would handle every= thing by contract, relying on a network of suppliers to obtain, store and d= eliver the goods while the company focused on squeezing out the best price.= =20 Dynegy, in contrast, has invested in such energy assets, including three po= wer plants in Southern California. It uses those assets to back its trading= operation, which is much smaller than Enron's.=20 Enron pulled off a migration from the ""dirty"" extreme of the oil patch, the= asset-intensive domain of drillers and explorers, to the ""clean"" end, wher= e all the deals are done on a computer screen. It also was a migration from= lower profit margins and lower risk to high margins and high risk.=20 Shannon B. Burchett, chief executive of Risk Limited Corp., an energy-orien= ted strategic-management consultancy in Dallas, compared Enron to the inves= tment bank Salomon Bros., where he used to work in the former PhiBro commod= ities unit.=20 Enron, Burchett said, embodies ""a Wall Street culture that happens to be in= Houston.""=20 Wall Street certainly ""got it,"" or thought it did.=20 Accounting Rules Pushed to the Limit=20 At Enron's zenith last year, when its stock peaked near $90 a share and it = was pushing into esoteric markets for weather derivatives and fiber-optic b= andwidth, Enron seemed to be a one-company wave of the future.=20 Enron's aggressiveness, brainpower and willingness to back radical new idea= s with serious capital helped it acquire an aura that in some ways was its = undoing, analysts said.=20 Investors accorded Enron's stock a price-to-earnings valuation that was con= sistently higher than those of its peers, reflecting the view that its cutt= ing-edge business model could consistently deliver faster-growing profit th= an its competitors.=20 To keep profits arcing ever upward to justify the outsize valuation, Enron = began pushing the accounting rules as hard as it pushed competitors in the = trading arena. It acknowledged as much in its statement Thursday, conceding= that the operations of three of the limited partnerships should have been = consolidated with Enron's own financial statements instead of being held se= parate.=20 By raising capital and running deals through the limited partnerships, Enro= n could keep large amounts of debt and certain volatile assets off its own = balance sheet, while simultaneously booking profit from the partnerships' t= ransactions, analyst Meade said.=20 Deals Backed by Costly Guarantees=20 One risky aspect of some of Enron's deals through the partnerships was what= Meade called a ""double-trigger guarantee,"" under which Enron would pledge = a cash payout if either its bond rating fell below investment grade or its = stock declined below a certain price.=20 The guarantees must have seemed a cheap way to sweeten a deal when Enron's = stock was flying high, but they came back to haunt the company later, when = it had to pay cash to make good on its obligations, Meade said.=20 Other energy-trading companies use similar devices, but Enron carried it to= an extreme and disclosed too little detail to make the process understanda= ble to investors, he said.=20 Enron's magic, like that of the Internet-stock phenomenon, had never been e= asy to understand in the first place. The company had a reputation among an= alysts for providing scanty financial detail and hard-to-grasp explanations= of some of its dealings.=20 But as long as the reported profit kept climbing, Enron kept getting the be= nefit of the doubt.=20 M. Carol Coale, a respected Houston-based analyst for Prudential Securities= , ruefully recalled a time last winter when she told Enron she could find ""= no positive catalyst for the stock"" and was considering downgrading her inv= estment opinion.=20 Skilling telephoned Coale and asked her to hold off, promising her that the= re was unspecified good news on the horizon that would justify her faith.= =20 ""I believed him,"" Coale said last week in an interview in Houston. She held= her rating steady at that time but has since downgraded Enron to an outrig= ht ""sell.""=20 Instead of Skilling's promised good news, questions mounted during the spri= ng, and Enron's stock continued a steady decline. Coale and other analysts = were troubled that a large proportion of Enron's earnings seemed to come no= t from its core trading operations but from unusual transactions involving = the company's own stock or that of affiliates.=20 In California, Enron played a key role as chief cheerleader for electricity= deregulation and a key energy middleman in the state. As wholesale electri= city prices soared and the state plunged into its energy crisis late last y= ear, Enron and other out-of-state electricity generators and traders became= favorite targets of California politicians and regulators, who said the co= mpanies were manipulating the market and charging too much for power.=20 But significantly, California was not a directly successful territory for E= nron.=20 Markets in water did not develop as Enron subsidiary Azurix envisioned. And= Enron's plans for selling electricity to retail customers were deferred ev= en as deregulation took effect in 1998 because the state's deregulation for= mulas didn't allow room for retail competition.=20 Lay complained about California frequently and met with the governor to try= to influence the state's moves to repair its energy problems. In an interv= iew in his Houston office in January--overlooking Enron's new headquarters = building, which is still under construction as the company's name disappear= s--Lay said he and other Enron executives had objected to the way Californi= a regulation was set up.=20 ""We objected more vehemently than anyone. We opposed the concept of the poo= l,"" he said, referring to the now-defunct California Power Exchange, in whi= ch most of the state's power was bought and sold in an hourly market. ""What= competitive market in the world has a pool? We don't buy our groceries thr= ough a centralized PX.""=20 Enron also backed away from building a small power plant in California last= year when the state imposed price caps.=20 One of the loudest complaints by Davis and other California officials was t= hat generators of electricity were playing ""games"" to get higher prices.=20 They criticized Enron severely, too, even though it was not a major generat= or, because the level of its worldwide trading operations--buying and selli= ng contracts worth billions of dollars in electric power every day--gave En= ron immense sway over pricing and supplies of electricity. They also believ= e that Enron and Lay helped play a part in the reluctance of federal regula= tors for several months to place restraints on the California marketplace.= =20 CEO's Future Role Uncertain=20 ""Millions of people in California businesses lost money because this rogue = company succeeded in controlling the government of the United States,"" said= state Sen. Peace, one of the architects of the state's deregulation plan.= =20 ""Ken Lay was a mystic,"" Peace said. ""Whatever he said had to make sense bec= ause he was Ken Lay.

As a consequence, the things Enron promoted a= nd pushed for were never challenged, intellectually and otherwise.""=20 Lay, who has been asked to sit on the board of the combined company, said F= riday that he had not yet decided whether to accept.=20 He described his time building Enron as ""a very long ride.

Financial Enron Accepts $8 Billion Buyout Offer From Dynegy; Energy Giant Was Forced = to Negotiating Table After Disclosing That It Had Overstated Earnings Peter Behr Washington Post Staff Writer 11/10/2001 The Washington Post=20 FINAL E01 Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved=20 Embattled Enron Corp. yesterday accepted a buyout offer valued at about $8 = billion from crosstown rival Dynegy Inc. If the deal is completed, it would= end Houston-based Enron's reign as the leader in the huge energy trading m= arkets that set the prices of power and natural gas in the nation.=20 Its cash dwindling and its credit rating hammered, Enron was forced to the = negotiating table after its recent disclosures that its obligations to a co= mplex web of partnerships involving company officials had caused the tradin= g powerhouse to overstate its earnings and obscure its total debt obligatio= ns. Four top Enron officials have resigned or been replaced since July and,= once Dynegy takes control, Enron's chairman and chief executive, Kenneth L= ay, will also leave the company. Lay said yesterday that he had not decided= whether to accept Dynegy's offer to serve on the combined company's board. ""It's been a good ride for a long time,"" Lay said in a conference call last= night. ""The last three weeks haven't been a whole lot of fun.""=20 The final deal was announced after the close of stock trading. Enron's shar= es -- which had fallen from $33 to $8 after the disclosures -- ended the da= y slightly higher, at $8.63. Dynegy's stock closed at $38.76, up $2.26.=20 Dynegy offered all stock for the Enron shares, so the total value of the de= al will fluctuate with Dynegy's stock price. Dynegy also said it would assu= me about $13 billion in Enron debt, bringing the total value of the transac= tion to around $21 billion.=20 Dynegy's rescue of Enron will begin with an immediate cash infusion of $1.5= billion, which will be supplied by ChevronTexaco Corp., a major Dynegy sto= ckholder. ChevronTexaco will invest another $1 billion in Dynegy after the = acquisition has passed regulatory review and is completed, which executives= said they expect will take six to nine months as Enron tries to unscramble= the complex partnerships that are now under investigation by the Securitie= s and Exchange Commission.=20 The takeover agreement gives Dynegy an escape clause permitting it to cance= l the purchase if Enron winds up with heavy regulatory fines or legal judgm= ents from shareholder suits tied to its handling of the partnerships.=20 Chuck Watson, Dynegy's chairman and chief executive, said in the conference= call that a close scrutiny over the past two weeks of Enron's financial co= ndition convinced him that the company's trading and pipeline businesses we= re solid. ""We looked under the hood, and guess what? It looked just as stro= ng as we thought it was."" Watson said he did not think more damaging disclo= sures were forthcoming from Enron.=20 Until the partnership mess, Enron was the nation's dominant energy trader, = and it had front-door political connections to the White House. Lay, its lo= ngtime chairman, raised more then $100,000 for the presidential election ca= mpaign of his friend George W. Bush. Enron rode the growth of energy tradin= g markets beginning in the mid-1990s, as first natural gas, and then electr= ic power sales were deregulated at the wholesale level. Its revenues leaped= from $9.2 billion in 1995 to $100.8 billion last year.=20 During those heady times, the Houston company could choose which questions = to answer about its dealings with related partnerships and its Byzantine bo= okkeeping.=20 ""It was always very difficult to get information,"" said Louis B. Gagliardi,= an analyst with John S. Herold Inc. ""They would always rebuff you.""=20 Until this fall, the muscular company seemed too big to stumble, said inves= tment manager David Coxe, with Harris Insight Equity Fund in Chicago.=20 Coxe bought 78,000 shares of Enron at $40 a share in August, after wrestlin= g with the decision for months, he said. Then Jeffrey Skilling, Enron's chi= ef executive and strategic mastermind, unexpectedly resigned. The stock, wh= ich had been as high as $90 in August 2000, pitched downward.=20 ""Enron seemed so indispensable to the nation's energy markets that I though= t it inconceivable it could implode,"" Coxe said. ""That's how I got sucked i= n.""=20 Enron's fall is ""classic hubris,"" Coxe said: a Greek tragedy striking someo= ne who chose to defy the gods -- ""in this case, the rules of the system.""= =20 Among the rules that Enron now acknowledges it didn't follow were the accou= nting standards that applied to the complex partnerships it created. The pu= rpose of the partnerships, Enron said, was to reduce the risks of investmen= ts in Internet transmission systems and to sell power plants and other asse= ts it no longer wanted.=20 The accounting errors were described in a 20-page SEC filing Enron made Thu= rsday. The errors resulted in a $1.2 billion reduction in the value of shar= eholders' equity. The company also said it had overstated its earnings by $= 586 million since 1997.=20 Enron created partnerships that would buy major assets -- such as a power p= lant -- that Enron wanted to sell, or in other cases, assets such as fiber-= optic cable networks that Enron intended to run but did not want to have on= its balance sheet.=20 The partnerships had outside investors, but the general partner of two of t= hem was Enron's own chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. He earned $30 m= illion in fees from managing two of the largest partnerships, according to = the SEC document.=20 Enron added to the capital of these partnerships by pledging its stock, or = securities convertible into stock. Some of those stock transactions should = have been counted as loans, resulting in the $1.2 billion drop in sharehold= er equity, Enron now says.=20 Investors are asking why Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, did not insi= st that these transactions be handled that way in the first place. Enron's = SEC filing mentions but does not explain some ""proposed audit adjustments"" = over the past four years that were overruled.=20 Even though, as Enron now acknowledges, it created an information barrier, = masking critical information and violating standard accounting rules, many = financial analysts who were recommending the stock to investors were not pu= shing hard enough to punch through that barrier, some analysts acknowledge.= =20 ""It was so complicated that everybody was afraid to raise their hands and s= ay, 'I don't understand it,' "" Gagliardi said.=20 The questions are now coming, from a new committee reporting to Enron's boa= rd that will investigate how the company's financial reporting was handled;= from the SEC; and, eventually, from teams of lawyers representing aggrieve= d shareholders.=20 Lay indicated yesterday he had not been aware until recently that Enron emp= loyees other than Fastow had profited from the partnership activity. Enron = directors had approved Fastow's management of the partnerships, but Fastow = quit the partnerships in July and was then replaced as chief financial offi= cer.=20 Enron this week fired Treasurer Ben Glisan and Kristina Mourdant, an Enron = division lawyer, who it said had invested in partnerships that were tied to= one of the major partnerships headed by Fastow. The Enron report to the SE= C describes a central role in these transactions played by Michael J. Koppe= r, an associate of Fastow who left Enron in July to take over Fastow's fina= ncial interests in the partnership, the company said.=20 Enron will hold a conference call next week to discuss what it has uncovere= d about outside partnership investments. http://www.washingtonpost.com Financial Desk The Nation NEWS ANALYSIS A Visionary Fallen From Grace JAMES FLANIGAN TIMES STAFF WRITER 11/10/2001 Los Angeles Times=20 Home Edition A-22 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company=20 A year ago, Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth L. Lay was on top of the energy wo= rld. As a leading fund-raiser, contributor and energy advisor to the Bush a= dministration, he played a key role in shaping the new president's energy p= olicy. As head of the world's largest energy trading company, he had an eno= rmous influence on the price of energy in California and across the nation.= Enron's highflying stock helped him cash out $123 million in stock options= last year alone.=20 On Friday, with Enron being saved from financial collapse by agreeing to be= acquired by rival Dynegy Inc., Lay's career and reputation are in shambles= . Under the merger, he will be stripped of a management job. His integrity = is tattered, with Enron's controversial financial dealings under federal in= vestigation. Enron investors and employees are chagrined and outraged becau= se the company's stock lost 80% of its value in recent weeks. The rapid rise and fall of Lay, 58, is a story of how a brilliant man with = innovative ideas and a grand scheme to transform the world's energy markets= was overcome with arrogance, associates and critics say. Under Lay, Enron = stretched the limits of the law and took risks that nearly caused its finan= cial collapse, they say. That in turn could have resulted in a widespread d= isruption in energy supplies.=20 ""Enron's behavior casts doubt on the integrity of our financial markets. It= is a very serious matter,"" said Edward R. Muller, an energy investor and f= ormer president of Edison International's Mission Energy subsidiary.=20 ""Nobody denies he's smart, but it's a question of integrity,"" said Raymond = Plank, chief executive of Apache Corp. and an associate of Lay's in Houston= 's vibrant oil and gas industry.=20 Lay and longtime partner Jeffrey K. Skilling, who served briefly as Enron's= chief executive before resigning abruptly in August, rose to prominence in= the last decade through the use of innovative financial techniques designe= d to exploit a reduction in government regulation of energy.=20 Lay transformed world energy industries through his vision of new, market-d= riven ways to finance natural gas and electricity production and transmissi= on.=20 The financial markets that Lay and his Enron associates created had an enor= mous effect on California's disastrous experiment in electricity deregulati= on. Critics say his influence was excessive and misguided.=20 ""Ken Lay was a mystic,"" said state Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon), an outspo= ken critic of Enron. ""Whatever he said had to make sense because he was Ken= Lay. It was hero worship. Many of the people working as economists at the = Federal Energy Regulatory Commission worshiped Ken Lay. As a consequence, t= he things Enron promoted and pushed for were never challenged, intellectual= ly and otherwise.""=20 Lay, who has a doctorate in economics, had modest beginnings as the son of = a poor country preacher who did farm labor on the side to raise money for h= is children's education. In the Navy in the late 1960s, Lay was assigned to= the Defense Department because of his economic acumen. ""He allocated Penta= gon dollars more efficiently in purchasing for the military,"" said Mark Pal= mer, chief spokesman for Enron.=20 Lay worked for Exxon and other energy firms in the 1970s, amid soaring oil = prices, gasoline shortages and still-regulated natural gas. He headed Houst= on Natural Gas, a predecessor firm of Enron, in the 1980s as falling prices= for oil and natural gas presented grave problems for Houston's energy indu= stries.=20 When the federal government allowed pipelines to carry the gas of any produ= cer, Lay turned Enron into a foremost firm in the new, deregulated industry= . Still, Enron almost went bankrupt in the late 1980s, with natural gas in = oversupply and prices falling.=20 It was then that Skilling, a McKinsey & Co. consultant, suggested to Lay th= at the firm trade long-term contracts for gas, promising to deliver the com= modity to customers at fixed prices, buying and selling contracts of varyin= g maturities ""the way mortgage companies deal with mortgages,"" in Skilling'= s words.=20 The innovation started Enron's rapid growth and rise to prominence as the e= mbodiment of a new kind of energy company. In the 1990s, the federal govern= ment called for deregulation of electricity.=20 Lay saw opportunities. He and Skilling created a market for contracts in el= ectricity in 1994, and by 1996 Enron was the world's leading firm doing suc= h business.=20 Lay's central idea was that, by creating a market of millions of buyers and= sellers constantly taking positions, power supplies could be allocated eff= iciently and prices lowered. Lay liked to lecture, in an avuncular way, abo= ut the new economics of energy trading.=20 ""Technology is changing, and there's a lot more value in flexibility and op= tionality. Just about in every industry, you can make them a lot more effic= ient when you have more optionality,"" Lay said in an interview in January i= n his Houston offices overlooking the sparkling new Enron headquarters buil= ding, which still is under construction.=20 As Enron's business profile grew, so did Lay's political influence. He serv= ed as an energy advisor to both Bush administrations and headed Texas fund-= raising for George W. Bush's presidential campaign. Lay raised $100,000 for= the Bush-Cheney campaign, and with his wife, Linda, Lay contributed anothe= r $100,000 to help finance the inaugural gala this year.=20 As the administration prepared its energy plan, Lay gained national stature= as a preacher of market economics applied to electricity.=20 ""There's no way you can centralize a command-control environment and make t= he best decisions to have an efficient, low-cost, reliable electricity indu= stry,"" Lay said.=20 His sermon was intended for California, which suffered sharply higher price= s for electricity last winter, to the point that private utilities fell int= o or near bankruptcy and the state budget incurred a cost of $12 billion, w= hich Sacramento now is trying to recover through the sale of revenue bonds.= =20 Because Enron, trading billions of dollars a day in power contracts worldwi= de, had an immense effect on electricity prices, Lay's preaching grated on = state officials. Driven to intemperance, state Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer said= in May that he'd like to ""escort"" Lay to a prison cell.=20 But more than economic philosophy was behind Lay's goading of California. T= he state's debacle gave energy deregulation a bad name and chilled deregula= tion moves by many other states.=20 That in turn reduced growth prospects for Enron. The promise of continued g= rowth in deregulation had helped make Enron a Wall Street darling. Its stoc= k price, at one point nearly $90 a share versus less than $10 now, pushed u= p the value of Enron stock options, held by almost all employees but owned = in great amounts by Lay, Skilling and other company officers.=20 Lay cashed in last year, converting options for a gain of $123 million, whi= le Skilling gained $62 million by converting his options. As they cashed in= , Enron was encountering other problems. Attempts to set up trading markets= in water and broadband Internet transmission were floundering. A major pow= er plant venture in India was in grave economic and political trouble.=20 But in the last month, Enron revealed that it had reduced the firm's equity= value by more than $1 billion due to write-offs in a hitherto hidden partn= ership.=20 Revelations then cascaded. The firm had 33 such partnerships, which had bil= lions of dollars in debt for which Enron was liable. Lay and Skilling piled= up debt in hidden partnerships, analysts explain, because the firm needed = huge amounts of debt to support its greatly expanding levels of trading in = electricity, natural gas and other commodities.=20 But the firm could not support such debt and still retain its credit rating= , growth rate and high stock price. After weeks of gamely protesting that t= he business was sound and that he personally took offense at investment ana= lysts' suggestions of impropriety, Lay fell silent.=20 *=20 Times staff writer Nancy Vogel in Sacramento contributed to this report.

But Atlanta-based Sout= hern Co. was not gloating at the misfortunes of its vanquished rival.=20 It wasn't easy. For years, the two companies were locked in a struggle over access to elect= ricity markets. Enron pushed for competition and deregulation, while Southe= rn resisted to protect its dominance in the fast-growing Southeast.=20 Sometimes the battle got nasty.=20 ""If Thomas Alva Edison came back from the dead and called Southern Co. to g= et some electricity, he'd find that nothing has changed,"" Jeffrey Skilling,= then Enron's president, said in November 1997. ""These guys are living in a= n industry that was created 100 years ago, and they want to keep it that wa= y.""=20 Fast forward four years.=20 Southern Co. has split itself in two, retaining its regulated Southeastern = utility business and spinning off its own unregulated power generation and = energy trading arm, Mirant Corp. Southern reported net income of $1 billion= for the first nine months of this year, and Mirant's profits were $538 mil= lion. Southern's shares are up 19 percent this year. Mirant's have declined= 7 percent.=20 Enron, on the other hand, lost 90 percent of its stock market value this ye= ar alone and this past week restated earnings for the past 4 1/2 years, red= ucing profit by more than $500 million.=20 Skilling was named chief executive in February but abruptly resigned after = six months.

""Bill' Dahlberg, who retired as Southern's chief executive in April an= d is now Mirant's board chairman, said he regretted Enron's troubles.=20 ""They were a rival and got credit for doing a lot of innovative things in o= ur industry,"" Dahlberg said. ""You always like to win the competition becaus= e you do well, not because somebody else does badly.""=20 Enron was a pioneer in the wholesale trading of electricity and natural gas= , and has been widely imitated, from Mirant's sprawling energy trading floo= r at Perimeter Center to an energy management subsidiary launched this year= by AGL Resources, parent of Atlanta Gas Light Co.=20 As the largest U.S. energy trading firm, Enron's tentacles run deep. It was= active at the Public Service Commission in 1998 when rules for Georgia's n= atural gas deregulation were written, only to opt out of becoming a gas mar= keter itself. But New Power Co., which is 45 percent owned by Enron, became= Georgia's newest marketer this year.=20 A Dynegy-Enron combination will create a $200 billion-a-year enterprise tha= t will dwarf Mirant in both the electricity and natural gas sectors.=20 Dynegy and Mirant are considered more stable than was Enron because they re= ly more on their own power plants for electricity and less on trading for p= ower produced by others. And Dynegy is no stranger to Georgia. It is a mino= rity partner with AGL Resources in Georgia Natural Gas Services, the state'= s No. 1 gas marketer.=20 But the partners have been at odds for months.=20 AGL sued Dynegy in July, alleging it ""earned millions of dollars at the exp= ense"" of the marketing company that it supplies with natural gas.=20 Dynegy's counterclaim accused AGL, among other things, of scheming to shift= the partnership's gas supply deal to AGL's own subsidiary, Houston-based S= equent Energy Management.=20 Dynegy in May started up a 500 megawatt natural gas-fired power plant in He= ard County despite opposition from nearby residents. Dynegy is also a major= buyer of electricity produced at Southern Co.'s new power plant in Jackson= County.=20 ""They're a big customer, a partner and a competitor --- all of those things= ,"" said Southern's Terrell.

""Dynegy is taking out a competitor, acquiring some attractive assets, and t= hey're doing it at an incredible price,"" said Joseph Correnti, an analyst a= t Wayne Hummer Investments.=20 The two Houston-based companies began negotiations a week ago as it became = apparent Enron needed cash to stay in business. Dynegy, which is 26-percent= owned by ChevronTexaco Corp., agreed to the deal after Moody's Investors S= ervice maintained an investment-grade rating on Enron, eliminating a stumbl= ing block in negotiations.=20 The combined company will have annual revenue of more than $200 billion, ra= nking it as one of the nation's 10 largest. It will have more than 22,000 m= egawatts of electric generating capacity and 25,000 miles of natural gas pi= peline.=20 On Thursday, Enron acknowledged it overstated earnings by about 20 percent = over the past four years and kept large amounts of debt off its balance she= et through business partnerships now under investigation by the Securities = and Exchange Commission. Enron said financial statements from 1997 through = the first half of 2001 ""should not be relied upon.""=20 Revised statements reduced Enron's profits for those years by $586 million = and increased its debt by $628 million.=20 During its recent turmoil, Enron fired chief financial officer Andrew Fasto= w, who ran some of the partnerships under investigation by the SEC.=20 Dynegy chief executive Charles Watson will head the combined company.=20 The terms of the deal value each Enron share at $10.41, based on Friday's c= losing stock prices. That represents a 21-percent premium above Enron's clo= sing price of $8.63. Dynegy's shares closed at $38.76, up 6 percent.=20 It was not immediately clear what role Enron chairman and chief executive K= enneth L. Lay would have in the new company.=20 While Watson has led a diversified company that put as much emphasis on bui= lding power plants as on energy trading, Lay focused on the wholesale tradi= ng of natural gas and electricity. He had expanded Enron in the 1980s from = a natural gas pipeline into the most formidable competitor in the business = of energy trading, which was created by deregulation of energy markets in t= he United States and Europe. Dynegy announces $8 billion deal to buy larger rival Enron By JUAN A. LOZANO Associated Press Writer 11/09/2001 Associated Press Newswires=20 Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.=20 HOUSTON (AP) - Energy marketer Dynegy Inc. announced Friday that it will bu= y its much larger rival, the once mighty but now troubled Enron Corp., for = $8 billion in stock. Dynegy also will assume a hefty $15 billion in Enron d= ebt.=20 The announcement came after Enron's stock price plummeted about 80 percent = over the past three weeks because of concerns that the company wasn't revea= ling serious financial problems to shareholders. Under the deal, ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns more than a quarter of Dyne= gy, would quickly provide about $1.5 billion. ChevronTexaco also would cont= ribute an additional $1 billion upon completion of the deal, the companies = said.=20 ""With its market-making capabilities, earnings power and proven strategic a= pproach to wholesale markets, Enron is the ideal strategic partner for Dyne= gy,"" Dynegy chairman and chief executive officer Chuck Watson said in annou= ncing the purchase.=20 Watson made it clear that he would not tolerate the sort of financial pract= ices that prompted explosive disclosures by Enron this week - including an = admission that more than half a billion dollars in debt had been kept off t= he company's books.=20 ""As a combined company, we will focus on leveraging our core skill sets and= , as always, we will keep a strong balance sheet and straightforward financ= ial structure as key priorities,"" Watson said.=20 Enron is the country's top buyer and seller of natural gas, and the No. 1 w= holesale power marketer. The company operates a 25,000-mile gas pipeline sy= stem, and also markets and trades metals, paper, coal, chemicals, and fiber= -optic bandwidth.=20 Dynegy controls nearly 15,000 megawatts of power generating capacity throug= h investments in power projects, and sells the energy in wholesale markets = and through utilities.=20 At a news conference, Watson said company officials who negotiated the deal= came away convinced that Enron was worth buying despite its recent trouble= s.=20 ""We looked under the hood and, guess what, it's just as strong as we though= t it was,"" Watson said.=20 Under the terms of the deal, Enron shareholders will receive .2685 Dynegy s= hare for each share of Enron common stock, valuing each Enron share at $10.= 41. Enron has about 775 million common shares, said spokeswoman Karen Denne= .=20 That represents a 21 percent premium above Enron's closing price of $8.63 F= riday on the New York Stock Exchange - but still just a fraction of their 5= 2-week high of $84.87. Dynegy's shares climbed $2.26, or 6 percent, to clos= e at $38.76 on the NYSE.=20 In after hours trading on the NYSE, Enron shares shot up 15.6 percent, or $= 1.35, to $9.98. Dynegy shares were unchanged.=20 Dynegy's stockholders will own approximately 64 percent of the new company,= with Enron's stockholders holding the remainder.=20 The boards of both companies have unanimously approved the transaction, whi= ch is expected to close next summer. The deal is expected to save the combi= ned company between $400 and $500 million annually because of continued eli= mination of ""non-core"" Enron holdings and lower operating costs. Watson sai= d it was too soon to say if the deal would result in job cuts. Enron has ab= out 20,000 employees, while Dynegy's work force is about 6,000.=20 Watson will remain as chairman and chief executive of the combined company,= which will retain the Dynegy Inc. name. Dynegy's Steve Bergstrom will cont= inue as president.=20 Enron chairman and chief executive Kenneth L. Lay will no longer have a rol= e in day-to-day management of the company, but has been offered a seat on t= he combined company's board and will help shepherd the merger through.=20 Dynegy said that Greg Whalley, the current president and chief operating of= ficer of Enron, will become an executive vice president of the new Dynegy. = He said the merger sets the best course for Enron.=20 ""Few of the options we considered for our core business going forward provi= ded us with the earning potential and immediate synergies that a merger wit= h Dynegy could deliver,"" Whalley said. ""Together with Enron's recently anno= unced bank commitments, this cash infusion gives Enron immediate liquidity,= which we believe will enable the company to maintain its investment grade = credit rating.""=20 The merger was announced a day after Enron acknowledged it overstated earni= ngs by about 20 percent over the past four years and kept large amounts of = debt off its balance sheets through business partnerships now under investi= gation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.=20 Analysts said the merger rescues Enron, but leaves Dynegy in uncharted terr= itory - with the outcome of the SEC investigation completely unknown. ""Ther= e is still a shroud hanging over Enron that now moves over to Dynegy,"" said= Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities.=20 Early Friday, Moody's Investors Service downgraded Enron's debt ratings to = one level above junk bond status and said the company's long-term debt rati= ngs remain under review for further downgrade.=20 In an SEC filing, Enron said financial statements from 1997 through the fir= st half of 2001 ""should not be relied upon"" and that outside businesses run= by Enron officials during that period should have been included in the com= pany's earnings reports.=20 The revised statements reduced Enron's profits for those years by $586 mill= ion, from $2.89 billion to $2.31 billion. The revisions also increased the = company's debt each of the four years, reaching $10.86 billion - $628 milli= on more than previously reported - by the end of 2000.=20 Keeping the debt off its balance sheets likely ensured Enron could maintain= a strong credit rating to support expansion of its core businesses - whole= sale trading of natural gas and electricity.=20 But the company's stock price started dropping 10 months ago when its high-= speed Internet unit foundered and Enron had trouble collecting money from p= ower customers in India.=20 The stock price began to free fall after Enron announced a $618 million thi= rd quarter loss, and news of the SEC investigation surfaced.=20 Enron responded by firing its chief financial officer and scrambled to get = cash and increase credit lines in an attempt to regain investor confidence,= but investors dumped Enron shares and sent its stock plummeting.=20 The ousted chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, ran some of the partners= hips under investigation by the SEC.=20 Jeff Skilling, Enron's former chief executive who left in August, has been = called to testify before the SEC, although it's unclear when.=20 ---=20 On the Net:=20 http://www.enron.com=20 http://www.dynegy.com AP Graphic DYNEGY ENRON Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

 ege and Work Product","I just spoke with Mary to make sure we have the same information. Here are the facts we have so far. On November 4th, the CPUC filed a motion with FERC to adopt the form of protective order that the CPUC entered, to compel the production of documents and to shorten time to answer. According to Exhibit B (read to me by Nancy Pickover at Bracewell) the following CPUC moved against the following entities: AES, Williams, Duke, Dynegy, Reliant and Southern. Enron entities were NOT named in exhibit B. This is not to say that we could not be easily added to the group. While the motion reads as if the CPUC was moving against everybody, in fact, in footnote 2 they state they are only moving against the entities named in Exhibit B. We will have Exhibit B in hand first thing tomorrow via FEDEX to confirm this. To repeat, Enron is not named yet.

We may not have a problem providing this information for use by FERC in its proceeding subject to a confidentiality agreement but I think we would oppose their requests for: the information to be provided for ""government eyes only"" - this would prohibit EPMI from defending itself vis-a-vis other market participants. a FERC confidentiality order that would could allow FERC to ""share"" this information with the CPUC (for purposes of the PUC's OII proceeding) pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 824h(c). 16 USC 824g(c) requires the Commission to make information available to state commissions as may be of assistance in state regulation of public utilities. We should argue that 16 USC 824h(c) does not apply here given that we are not a public utility nor does the PUC regulate how much market power wholesale marketers exercise or the level of market power mitigation (these are the bases the PUC provides for explaining why it should have this information.) the above contractual information to allow them to analyze the competitiveness of the forward market to evaluate the wisdom of the Commission's decision to allow the UDC's ""unfettered access"" to the forwards market.

Here is the state of play. There are two interrelated tracks at present: the DeLay, et al negotiations of all stakeholders (which I attended and participated in today but did not concern reliability) and the NERC process that is underway to consider how to bring those such as Enron that are not ""on board"" with the so-called ""consensus"" NERC language (Sarah participated in the Tuesday meeting on this issue, where PJM put a proposal on the table that Sarah advises largely tracks our draft; this process will continue next week and a follow up meeting the week after). The interrelationship is that it is likely that IF (a big IF) there is an electric title that is added to the congressional bill that will start moving in the House subcommittee next week, the NERC version will be included as a ""place holder"" with the understanding that if the NERC discussion process yields a different result, it will be substituted. Furthermore, those who oppose the NERC version would be free to continue opposing it on the Hill and elsewhere. So you might say there is a rebuttable ""presumption"" of sorts in favor of the NERC version (which is shorter than the old NERC version) because so many groups favor it, but those who oppose it such as ourselves continue to seek allies for a shorter, streamlined version.

The existing line has been part of the NNG interstate transmission system. = Under the new ownership, the line will become part of the Wisconsin Gas dis= tribution system and will interconnect with Guardian Pipeline as well as th= e NNG system.=20 ""Northern Natural Gas is pleased to be a part of a creative, cost-effective= solution to provide additional gas service to southeastern Wisconsin,"" sai= d Dave Neubauer, vice president of business development and marketing, Nort= hern Natural Gas.

All Rights Reserved. =09 Futures Contract Covering Coal Debuts in New York (Correct) 2001-07-13 08:48 (New York) Futures Contract Covering Coal Debuts in New York (Correct) (Corrects location of FirstEnergy Corp. in 10th paragraph of story that moved yesterday.) New York, July 12 (Bloomberg) -- The New York Mercantile Exchange today began trading a futures contract for low-sulfur coal, a fuel that President George W. Bush said will play a major role in meeting electricity demand over the next two decades. The contract's debut came after prices for coal, considered the dirtiest of power-plant fuels, doubled in the past year, as demand from power plants outstripped mine production. Coal for September delivery opened at $42 a ton and settled at $40.75, as 98 contracts were traded, exchange officials said. ``We had a big run-up in coal prices this past winter,'' said Andy Ozley, who buys coal for Atlanta-based Mirant Corp.'s six coal plants in New York, Illinois, Maryland and Virginia. ``This contract affords us a way to mitigate our exposure'' to large price swings. The Bush administration said in an energy policy report this spring that coal would be the dominant fuel for electricity generation through 2020. Bush gave an added boost to the fuel when he retreated from a campaign pledge to restrict carbon dioxide emissions, implicated in global warming. Coal plants are responsible for a third of the nation's carbon dioxide emissions. They also produce sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain, and nitrogen oxides, which cause smog. The Nymex started the futures contract to give mining companies and utilities a way to hedge their risks in the $33 billion coal market. Producers such as Peabody Energy Corp. and Arch Coal Inc., whose shares have soared in the past year, have said they would trade the futures. New Plants Last year's quadrupling of prices for natural gas -- a cleaner-burning power-plant fuel -- prompted many generators to ramp up output from their coal plants. Utility coal stockpiles dwindled, and prices have risen to their highest levels since at least 1989. So far this year, more than a dozen companies have announced plans to build coal-fired plants, including Kansas City, Missouri- based Kansas City Power & Light Co. and Portland, Oregon-based PacifiCorp. Although coal is used to produce 52 percent of the nation's electricity, few plants were built during the 1990s because of the high costs of building them and the difficulty of complying with federal and local environmental regulations. Demand for coal has eased in recent weeks as below-normal temperatures in the U.S. Midwest and Northeast reduced demand for air conditioning, said Jim Parks, who buys coal for six power plants in Ohio and Pennsylvania as director of fuels at Akron, Ohio-based FirstEnergy Corp. ``The summer's been pretty mild so far -- you haven't seen any big heat waves'' in regions with the most coal generation, he said. Big Sandy The Nymex futures contract calls for the delivery of 1,550 tons of low-sulfur coal to the mouth of the Big Sandy River near Huntington, West Virginia. From there, the fuel would be loaded onto Ohio River barges and shipped to power plants in the U.S. and possibly Europe. The new contract is tailored to producers in Appalachian states that account for about 40 percent of U.S. production, including West Virginia, Kentucky and Pennsylvania, the No. 2, 3 and 4 coal producers. The industry lacks a futures contract for coal from Western states that account for 47 percent of the nation's production, including the No. 1 producer, Wyoming. Avoiding the Past The exchange, which earns commissions on trades, hopes coal futures will avoid the fate of other contracts it has started over the past few years. Its six electricity futures contracts have fizzled, as has its Middle East sour crude oil contract, which debuted in May 2000. ``I said yesterday, if you traded 100 to 200 contracts, that would be a really a good day,'' said Chris Casale, vice president of energy trading at Dynegy Inc. in Houston, which trades coal and buys the fuel for its six power plants in New York and Illinois. ``It came out sort of on target.'' Most of today's trading was originated by large energy marketing companies, he said, although he declined to say whether Dynegy traded any contracts. Enron Corp., the largest energy trader, and Duke Energy Corp., the largest U.S.-based utility holding company, have said they would trade coal futures. Exchange officials have said the coal market has the potential to reach 5,000 trades a day after a year of trading. The Nymex's 17-year-old crude oil futures contract averages about 66,700 trades a day, and its 11-year-old natural gas contract averages about 33,500. Wary of Coal ``The coal market is still lacking liquidity,'' said Anthony McAuley, a floor broker at ABN Amro Inc., who said he bought five coal contracts for a client at $42 a ton -- the market's first transaction. ``You probably need to see a little more participation'' from industry coal buyers and sellers for the market to take off. Independent floor traders, known as locals, are wary of trading coal futures without assurances that the industry will be active as well. ``Floor traders lost millions'' in electricity futures when some were caught with high-priced contracts and nobody in the industry to sell them to, he said. ``Because of that, people are a little bit tentative about coal,'' said Tom Schiff, an independent crude oil trader. ``We're here to help make liquidity but we can't tackle all the risk.'' =09=09=09 =09=09=09 =09=09 Modern Metals, July 2001 Giant energy concern now turns its atten= tion to steel. The company's aggressive posture has begged controversy. Ind= ustry reactions vary from hand-wringing to open arms. Still others characte= rize Enron as a ""non-event."" By Michelle Martinez Arjona, Editor-in-Chief, = and Paul Hohl, Contributing Editor These days, saying the word ""Enron"" in = a room full of metals executives is like screaming ""fire"" in a crowded thea= ter. For most in the steel industry, the idea of a futures market is enough= to raise a few eyebrows. But when a major market maker with annual revenue= s of 10 times the market cap of the U.S. steelmaking industry stakes a clai= m (for 2000 alone, Enron logged revenues of $101 billion--that's with a ""b""= ), a lot more than eyebrows are likely to be raised. After a bold presentat= ion from Jeff McMahon, president and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets, at th= e SSCI annual convention in May (in which he accused steel mills of treatin= g their service center customers as ""annoyances""), industry leaders rushed = to understand this latest market contender. Friend or foe? Competitor or p= artner? These are just a couple of the questions surrounding Enron's aggres= sive push into the metals industry. Judging from the service center and mil= l executives Modern Metals queried, there are as many answers as there are = opinions in the industry. Reactions ranged from fear to acceptance to downr= ight resentment. At least one mill was reticent to discuss Enron at all--st= ill others seemed to meet the issue with unaffected shrugs. If the saying i= s true that all publicity is good publicity, the buzz that Enron has genera= ted would make even a Hollywood spin doctor envious. What's the hubbub? Alt= hough products such as natural gas and energy--Enron's major business platf= orm--have been traded as commodities for years, until Enron's appearance a = formal forward market for steel has never existed. According to McMahon, th= e absence of a liquid and transparent market has resulted in ""uninformed in= vestment decisions"" that have exacerbated the current oversupply situation,= and left companies exposed to the hazards of price volatility. Enron's an= swer is to offer a variety of financial hedging products along with forward= contracts in hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanized (plate and long produc= ts are soon to follow), locking in prices for as many as five years out. En= ron contends that it can act as a ""risk intermediary"" in steel transactions= , ensuring healthier profit margins and lowering the cost of capital. Certa= in grades of steel are commodities, McMahon insists, and as such should be = bought and sold on a commodity market basis, instead of the strategic relat= ionships that now exist between the mills and consumers. Enron has been off= ering steel online, and via phone and fax, since November of last year. ""Be= fore you add capacity, before you make an investment decision, you'll be ab= le to see a three, five, maybe even a 10-year forward price of steel,"" McMa= hon stated, ""and if you want to hedge that investment you can do that."" The= company plans to buy steel at a floating price and then sell it to steel c= onsumers at a fixed rate, making money on the spread. In February, Greg Her= mans, VP of steel trading at Enron, reported to AMM that it was offering U.= S.-made 10-gauge, 48-in. wide hot-rolled for April delivery in Chicago for = $225 a ton. Hermans said Enron was buying the same product for April delive= ry at $215 a ton. Eventually, Enron sees the development of four different= marketplaces: the Northeast, the Midwest (or Chicago area), the Gulf Coast= (or Houston area), and the West Coast. Enron will hedge against spot price= spikes through equity and physical holdings in domestic mills. The company= closed on Huntco's Arkansas-based cold-rolling mill in June. ""It's a big p= ortfolio,"" McMahon said. ""We wanted to put together a portfolio of supply a= nd demand. In some cases, we'll own assets--hopefully we'll own some term c= ontracts with domestic mills. To the extent that imports are a part of the = equation, we'll be a part of that market. We may purchase capacity from som= ebody, not necessarily the assets, but toll slab through a hot strip mill. = All of those combined is how we do our business."" Steel mills can benefit, = McMahon said, by entering into a multi-year ""physical off take"" with Enron,= thus giving steel mills a degree of certain volume and on product specific= ation. Enron would guarantee purchase of a specified amount of tonnage, and= use a floating price or a floor price to guard against market shocks. Whet= her mills would be willing to divert capacity to the commodity grades being= bought and sold by Enron remains uncertain. At least one mill executive pr= ivately said no . . . at least for now. Nucor president, CEO and vice chair= man, Dan DiMicco also sees little value in Enron's proposal. ""What we need = to have is stable pricing at levels where the most efficient mills can make= a good return on their capital and further invest in new technologies and = equipment,"" he stated. ""I define true value as helping the industry to beco= me stronger. It doesn't do any good to maintain a lack of price volatility = at $200 a ton."" Keith Busse, CEO at Steel Dynamics, echoed that sentiment i= n a recent New Steel article. ""If you're trying to get volatility out at $3= 20 [per ton], great,"" he said. ""But at $230, you want to stick your fingers= down your throat."" For the service centers Service centers, McMahon sugges= ted, could benefit immediately. ""The only way [distributors] are able to he= dge themselves is to go out and buy inventory,"" he explained. ""That takes c= apital, and cash, and space. We can offer a financial product that gives th= e exact same protection, but doesn't require any of the above. ""We can hold= those inventories and price the steel at the time of delivery to the servi= ce centers,"" he continued, ""so their 4- or 5- percent net margins are somew= hat certain."" ""I do think that Enron is providing a service for the industr= y . . . "" commented Dave Lerman, CEO of Steel Warehouse, South Bend, Indian= a. But he pointed out that ""how [it] moves forward will be interesting. If = they just move forward with hedge instruments . . . that's independent of w= hether you run your business well by having a good supplier that matches up= with the demands of your customers. I think [Enron] will be a good thing f= or some people and a non-event for others."" Beyond hedging, McMahon pointed= out, firm and enforceable contracts could become a key benefit to service = centers. As one Midwestern distributor source commented, ""One of the terrib= le things that happens in our business is that end users demand long-term p= ricing, beyond what anybody can foresee. When they anticipate the market is= going up, or that it has hit a low point, they push harder for it--as any = one would. But historically, they don't honor the deals."" In a down market= , he explained, customers demand lower prices. Noncompliance can result in = orders, but no releases, and a ""don't call us, we'll call you"" attitude fro= m customers. The consequence for service centers, he said, are price reduct= ions on the way down and on the way up. ""If Enron brings integrity to both = sides of this market,"" he concluded, ""that would be a very big plus for the= steel industry."" But integrity, another Midwest service center exec counte= red, has got nothing to do with it. In his estimation, Enron is like a prof= iteering carpetbagger, ""trying to make a buck in between the producer and t= he user. That's all we need right now,"" he declared, ""somebody trying to sq= ueeze out a few more dollars."" But, he recognized, ""we're all going to have= to deal with it."" Don McNeeley, president and CEO of Chicago Tube & Iron, = indicated that some good could come of a heavy-hitter like Enron introducin= g new ideas into the industry, but acknowledged that people might be offend= ed by somebody picking the so-called ""low-hanging fruit"" of the steel marke= t in the current economy. ""What do you think the mills are going to do when= you come to them for just the peripheral items?"" he queried. ""My concern w= ould be that the price would go up on [those items]."" McNeeley also questio= ned the wisdom of distributors relinquishing control of their inventories. = ""In distribution, 60 percent of our net worth is inventory, 30 percent is a= ccounts receivable, and 10 percent is plant property and equipment,"" he rel= ated. ""Our single largest asset is our inventory. If a distribution company= surrenders control of its inventory to a third party, does not that distri= butor, in effect, surrender its own sovereignty?"" Only just begun Questions= abound regarding Enron's role as a physical supplier of steel as well. As = one Minnesota-based service center exec put it, ""are they ready to deal wit= h problems?"" Although Enron has expressed interest in being a physical supp= lier, Dave Lerman explained, ""I think that's going to be a lot more difficu= lt to implement."" Enron would have to consider specific qualities, coil siz= es, nuances of chemistry, surface quality, and formability. ""Most customers= require better than standard tolerances,"" he pointed out. ""These are all i= ssues that might complicate commodity sales."" Delivery is another issue. As= a physical supplier, Enron has virtually guaranteed just-in-time delivery,= but as one service center source said, ""the guarantee is good when the mat= erial shows up at my door. What happens if it doesn't show up? I disappoint= a customer. What good does it do to sue [Enron] if I've lost a customer?"" = Mill executives have questioned whether Enron is a potential competitor. ""T= hey see Enron as someone likely to buy foreign steel in order to deliver it= to a U.S. customer,"" said Chuck Bradford, principal of Bradford Research a= nd a long-time industry observer. He cautioned against seeing Enron as too = much of a physical supplier, speculating that the future of Enron, similar = to the LME, will be in hedging. ""You may see some [physical transactions] t= o start with,"" Bradford predicted, ""just to get the ball rolling. But I don= 't see that as the way the market will develop."" McMahon has been consisten= t in saying that Enron has little interest in becoming a steel manufacturer= . The real value, he said, is in a transparent, liquid market. ""We know the= products work, we know the market wants them. Can any one particular mill = or mills prevent that? We don't think so,"" he said. ""It's not an 'if', it's= a 'when'."" The jury is still out on just how soon that ""when"" will come, a= nd what those effects will be for the steel industry. And for all of the de= bate surrounding the issue, it seems a bit soon to be hitting the panic but= ton. As Don McNeeley recounted, ""I can recall similar controversy over a sp= eech a guy gave about 15-17 years ago. That guy's name was Ken Iverson, and= he had this concept called a mini-mill.

By Thomas Buckley The Press-Enterprise LAKE ELSINORE A new group has raised its objections to Lake Elsinore's proposed hydroelectric plant and the power lines that might carry its electricity to San Diego County. On Thursday, the Elsinore Valley Municipal Water District board set aside for further study later this month a motion by Director Gary Kelley to ensure that both the lines and the actual power plant that make up a $450 million proposal from Enron North America proceed together. But residents of La Cresta, a mountaintop community near where the lines might run, did not care whether the plant and lines happened together. Many of them do not want the lines to be there at all. ""We are resolved to keep power lines out of the Cleveland National Forest and the San Mateo Wilderness Area,"" said La Cresta resident Bill Stockmar. ""Our constituents and the local residents impacted by the proposed project are outraged and respectfully demand immediate intervention to stop this project at the planning level."" As it stands now, the power lines from the hydroelectric plant would run from Temescal Canyon to Camp Pendleton along the ridge line of the Elsinore Mountains just west of the lake. Those lines could run in a narrow strip of forest land just west of the La Cresta community. Enron project manager Rob Bakondy said the final determination of where the lines might run is not set, but he said the power lines could be built at least a year before the plant itself. Besides serving the hydroelectric plant, the power lines could be used to replace lines San Diego Gas and Electric wants to build through Murrieta and Temecula to bring power to San Diego. The water district also announced it is considering financing and building the lines itself. District General Manager John Rossi said Wednesday that it was too early to say exactly how the lines would be built, but that the district's building or owning the lines, or both, in cooperation with Enron is ""one possibility."" Board President Kris Anderson said it is too early to tell whether it would benefit the district to become so directly involved in the project. But he said the district would be able to borrow the approximately $50 million needed to build the lines at a lower interest rate than a private company could get. That difference, Anderson said, could mean extra dollars for the district. How Governor Davis' proposal to purchase thousands of miles of transmission lines from the ailing utilities will affect the project is not yet clear, said Enron spokeswoman Kathy Russeth. The timing of the construction of the project, if it is approved by state and federal regulators, will not be finally known until a contract between Enron and the water district has been agreed upon. That is expected to happen by the end of May. GOP in a fix over power crisis Leaders seek solutions that won't undercut past support for deregulation By Daniel Borenstein TIMES POLITICAL EDITOR California Republican Party leaders are trying desperately to politicize the state's electricity crisis by blaming Gray Davis, but it seems that the harder they try the more popular the Democratic governor becomes. The latest GOP push will come today when party leaders, meeting in Sacramento for the start of their three-day state convention, hold a hastily organized workshop on energy. ""We should be explaining to California that Gray Davis was asleep at the switch last year,"" said one of the scheduled speakers, Republican strategist Dan Schnur. ""But that message can only work if it's coupled with a proposal for an alternative solution."" So far, that hasn't happened. For all the complaints about Davis, Republicans are moving even slower. Looking to 2002, when Davis will stand for re-election, the GOP has run radio ads attacking the governor for delays. But the party has yet to distinguish itself with a solid plan of its own. ""If Republicans are able in the next couple of months to articulate a clear plan, which is different from the Democratic plan, yes, we can use it as a political message,"" said Stuart DeVeaux, spokesman for the California Republican Party. ""Are Republicans in Sacramento going to come up with a plan that articulates a future for our energy problem? I'm not telling you it's going to be revealed this weekend. It's my hope it will be articulated this weekend."" Republicans are caught in an ideological quagmire. Pushing for re-regulation of electricity conflicts with the party's basic tenet of less government interference. Conversely, arguing for full deregulation puts Republicans at odds with a solid majority of Californians. A Los Angeles Times poll taken Feb. 14-15 found that 60 percent of Californians want to go back to a regulated electricity industry, while 25 percent are opposed. The GOP problem is exacerbated because there is no easy policy solution to the energy mess, said Jack Pitney, government professor at Claremont McKenna College. ""It's difficult to see how we get out of this situation without considerable cost. If there were a silver bullet, somebody would have found it by now."" Republicans have attacked Davis for his plan to buy power lines from private utilities. ""Everybody agrees there's $1 billion or $2 billion in deferred maintenance,"" said GOP consultant Sal Russo, another speaker at the party's convention today. ""We need to be in this business like a hole in the head."" But the Times poll found that Californians, by a 52-36 margin, favor the idea. Moreover, Davis' job approval rating has climbed this year. In January, 49 percent approved and 25 percent disapproved. In February, it was up to 57-26. Californians give Davis better marks for handling the electricity crisis than they give President Bush. Republicans are going to have difficult time laying the political blame on Davis. ""It's 'Murder on the Orient Express.' Everybody did it,"" Pitney said. ""Although you can make a case that Davis was slow in reacting, no one can seriously pin him with the primary blame for the problem."" The deregulation bill passed the Legislature in 1996 with the strong support of both parties and a Republican governor, Pete Wilson. Senate Minority Leader Jim Brulte, R-Rancho Cucamonga, is considered one of the Republican Party's top strategists. He was also one of the leading proponents of the deregulation bill. For all of those reasons, Garry South, Davis' political strategist, said he does not fear a GOP attack on electricity. ""If the Republicans want to get into a full-out firefight over how this mess came about, I'm more than willing to play. They don't have a very good story to tell."" For now, Davis' political strength is stable. But the 2002 primary elections are still more than a year away, and the general election is a political eternity from now. ""If this isn't resolved, there is nothing to guarantee that there won't be a voter backlash against the government,"" said political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe. ""And right now the government in California is the Democratic Party."" That's the message the Republicans want to drive home. But if they can't come up with their own alternative, they might have a hard time playing the blame game. Davis says state has tentative deal for Edison grid Updated: Feb. 23, 2001 - 4:42 p.m. LOS ANGELES -- After a week of intense closed-door negotiations with utility representatives, Gov. Gray Davis said Friday he had reached an ""agreement in principle"" with Southern California Edison to buy the utility's power lines for an estimated $2.7 billion. The deal also requires Edison International, the parent company of Edison, to sell cheap power to the state for a decade. ""This is the framework of a good, balanced deal,"" Davis said. ""It's not a final deal. There's a lot of work to be done, But we're making progress."" The governor said he did not expect customer rates to increase as a result of the deal. Edison did not immediately return calls seeking comment. The state has been in talks for a week to buy a total of 26,000 miles of transmission lines from Edison, Pacific Gas and Electric and Sempra Energy, which operates San Diego Gas & Electric. The total cost of the lines could range from $4.5 billion to $7 billion. The effort is intended to help restore the financial health of the state's two largest utilities, PG&E and Edison, both of which are near bankruptcy. The $2.7 billion price for the Edison lines amounts to 2.3 times the estimated book value, Davis said. The utilities say they have lost nearly $13 billion since June, trapped between soaring wholesale power prices and state-imposed rate caps for consumers. The tentative plan announced by Davis would allow Edison to issue bonds for a substantial portion of its losses. Davis said the state is making good progress in its talks with Sempra and ""some progress"" with PG&E. Thursday, Davis said he will not sign off on any grid buyout without all three utilities' participation. ""I do not believe we can make a satisfactory arrangement without 60 percent of the transmission grid, and that would require cooperation with PG&E,"" he said Friday. PG&E spokesman Ron Low said Thursday night that talks had ended with no resolution that day. ""These are complicated problems that will not be solved overnight,"" Low said. ""There are clearly some issues where we are very far apart."" Still, PG&E chief executive officer Robert Glynn Jr. said Friday the meeting with Davis was a ""milestone in the resolution of California's energy crisis"" and said he was willing to meet further to discuss the utility's proposal. ""Each utility's issues and opportunities in this crisis are different, and we believe that PG&E has proposed a detailed solution that balances ratepayer and shareholder interests,"" Glynn said in a statement issued Friday before the governor's news conference. The company said it would have no further comment. The tentative agreement also calls for: Edison parent Edison International to make payments to the utility of about $420 million. Edison International to commit the entire output of its Sunrise Mission power project at low, cost-based rates for 10 years. Davis said that arrangement could save ratepayers $500 million over the next two years. Edison to provide cost-based rates from generating plants it owns for another 10 years. Edison to drop its lawsuit against the California Public Utilities Commission claiming that imposed rate caps were illegal under federal law. ""This entire transaction, which I believe is fair and balanced for both sides, will be accomplished within the existing rate structure,"" Davis said. ""We will not be asking any more of consumers to allow this transaction to come to pass."" Davis said negotiations will continue in the coming days. Consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield called the governor's plan ""an outrageous giveaway"" and predicted that if lawmakers didn't halt it, voters would revolt. ""The most outrageous part of this isn't even paying 2.3 times what the lines are worth, but then allowing the parent companies that siphoned off billions of dollars to pay only the tax payment they already owe,"" Rosenfield said. The Public Utilities Commission already regulates how much the utilities can charge for power their own plants generate, Rosenfield said. --By Leslie Gornstein, Associated Press Writer - Utilities Search for Long-Term Fix During Breather State purchase of power lines under discussion Friday,?February 23, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle Sacramento -- A break in the weather and a break in the energy crisis coincided yesterday, as California enjoyed its first day in more than a month without a power alert. With the short-term picture for power improving, representatives of the state's three troubled utilities met separately with Gov. Gray Davis and his staff to work on a longer-range fix for the power crisis that would include state purchase of the firms' transmission lines. Trouble loomed in at least one set of talks, however, as Pacific Gas and Electric Co. said it was ""very far"" from reaching a deal. The California Independent System Operator, which coordinates the flow of electricity through the state's power grid, removed all power alerts at about 9 a.m. yesterday. Spokeswoman Lorie O'Donley said that with springtime approaching and weather improving, and with some power plants coming back to full output from maintenance, the overall picture is brightening. ""We're optimistic,"" she said. ""We're coming into the spring season, the majority of generators have had their maintenance completed. But everything is dependent on the weather and temperature."" The last day California had no power alerts was Jan. 13. Since then, there have been two days of rolling blackouts in Northern California and many other days of Stage 3 alerts -- when power reserves dip below 1.5 percent of available capacity. The mildest alert, Stage 1, is declared when reserves are between 5 and 7 percent of capacity. The supply of power has been helped by warmer temperatures in other Western states, cutting demand there, and by an increase in generators on line in California, O'Donley said. Last week, when the state was still in Stage 3 alerts, 10,500 megawatts were offline in California. Yesterday, there were 8,200 megawatts offline, a difference that provides enough power for a couple million homes. O'Donley warned that the supply picture in California is still tight, and conservation still necessary. But the focus of attention was turning to Sacramento and Davis' talks with the utilities. Davis announced a plan last week for the state to purchase 26,000 miles of utility-owned transmission lines in exchange for backing bonds that allow the utilities to repay the almost $13 billion in debt they say they owe. While Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric have indicated willingness to sell their lines, PG&E has refused to comment on the proposal. It is not clear if PG&E is unwilling to sell or simply trying to strike a harder bargain. The utility had accumulated more debt than its Southern California counterparts, and also owns the largest part of the transmission line grid. Talks between Davis' staff and PG&E did not start until late yesterday afternoon, and indications were that they were more difficult than negotiations involving the other two utilities. ""They're just on a different page,"" Michael Peevey, the former Edison president who is Davis' chief negotiator, told Bloomberg News. PG&E spokesman Ron Low said, ""These are difficult problems that cannot be solved overnight. There are clearly some areas where we are very far apart."" Davis hopes to make an announcement with at least one of the utilities before leaving today for the four-day National Governors Association meeting in Washington, D.C. The union that represents some 11,000 PG&E employees, meanwhile, called on Davis to negotiate state ownership of two power plants under construction in which PG&E holds large stakes. Jack McNally, business manager of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 1245, in Walnut Creek told Davis in a letter that a transmission line takeover would be a ""grand experiment"" fraught with danger. Acquiring the two prospective power plants, in Kern and San Diego counties, would do more to address energy shortages than taking over transmission lines that need hundreds of millions of dollars in maintenance, union officials said. Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio countered that state acquisition of transmission lines ""would not affect one union job,"" as the state would simply lease the grid back to the utilities. Maviglio predicted union jobs would increase with investment in new capacity and system upgrades. Chronicle staff writers Patrick Hoge and Robert Salladay contributed to this report. State's energy price tag increases Published Friday, Feb. 23, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News BY DION NISSENBAUM Mercury News Sacramento Bureau SACRAMENTO -- California's energy crisis took another big bite out of the state budget Thursday when finance aides to Gov. Gray Davis announced that the cost of buying energy may top $3 billion by mid-March. In a move that raised new alarms for lawmakers, the governor's finance team for the third time this month asked for $500 million to buy electricity in the coming weeks while Davis tries to work out a deal to bail out the state's near-bankrupt utilities. That, combined with money spent last month to buy energy, could drain the state coffers of $3 billion by St. Patrick's Day. The request for more cash came on the same day that California spent its first day in weeks without an official energy emergency and Davis held critical talks with the heads of Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. The talks are aimed at rescuing the two companies and Southern California Edison from financial collapse. While Davis had expressed hope last week of working out a deal by today, sources said that an agreement still remains elusive. Until a compromise can be hammered out, the state is being forced to pay upward of $50 million a day from the general fund to buy electricity. State leaders expect that the money will eventually be repaid to the general fund under a $10 billion bond package. But lawmakers are growing increasingly concerned about the short-term impact on the state fiscal plan. Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San Francisco, said the latest request for more money could create ``greater concern and anxiety'' among lawmakers and added that the energy crisis was going to make it harder to fund other programs, such as support for abused children. ``It's going to be a bleak year for other budget priorities,'' said Migden, who is chairwoman of the powerful Assembly Appropriations Committee. Earlier this week, the state's independent financial analyst warned that the energy crisis could eat into state money the governor wants to spend on other things such as the environment and public safety. While lawmakers have so far bitten their tongues about the growing power price tag, Migden said the Legislature might be hesitant to allow the costs to go any higher. ``I can't imagine another infusion after this being required,'' Migden said. ``I think this has to be the last request because we're going to hit fundamental core programs.'' Waiting for bailout plan California stepped in to buy the energy last month after PG&E and Southern California Edison lost the financial wherewithal to do it themselves. At the time, state leaders reluctantly agreed to buy the energy for a short period of time as part of a larger plan for California to sign long-term contracts with power generators. But those negotiations have failed to produce much energy so far, and Davis said earlier this week that the power producers are hesitant to sign any deals until California agrees to a bailout plan for the utilities. On Thursday, one power producer -- Williams Cos. -- announced that it had signed a 10-year contract with the state to provide up to 1,400 megawatts of power to California. In a bid to work out the bailout plan, Davis and his advisers met Thursday and were to meet again today with top executives from all three electric utilities in financial trouble. The Democratic governor wants to buy 26,000 miles of high voltage transmission lines owned by the three companies in exchange for helping the utilities pay off $13 billion in debts. The utilities are being asked to protect thousands of acres of wilderness lands they own, hang onto power plants that provide the state with its cheapest electricity, and drop explosive lawsuits that could allow the companies to dramatically raise customer rates. But sources said talks have bogged down on the transmission line deal, which PG&E has been reluctant to accept. Alternative energy helps out While talks slogged along in the governor's office, state lawmakers announced that another key piece of the puzzle needed to solve the energy crisis was falling into place. State Sen. Jim Battin, R-Palm Desert, and Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Santa Cruz, said that alternative energy producers had agreed to dramatically lower their prices in a deal that could save California $3 billion to $4 billion. Those energy producers, nearly 700 wind, solar and natural gas-fired plants, provide about a third of the state's energy. Paying for power still a big question POWER CRISIS PG&E doesn't like the plan the PUC proposed to collect electricity costs By Mike Taugher TIMES STAFF WRITER Three weeks after Gov. Gray Davis signed into law the state's centerpiece for stabilizing energy costs, big differences remain over how the solutions will be implemented and who will pay for them. The plan, outlined in legislation known as AB1X, was intended first to stop the financial bleeding of California's two largest utilities by asking the state to buy enough unsecured power to keep the lights on. Next, the state would enter long-term contracts for less expensive power that would eventually lessen the need for more costly, last-minute electricity. But the state has balked at buying the entire portfolio of last-minute electricity that is needed, and a disagreement emerged Thursday over what portion of consumers' bills should be used to reimburse state coffers. Meanwhile, progress on completing contracts has been slow, although two were signed Thursday. A spokesman for Davis said more contracts for relatively low-cost power would be signed once the state bought the utilities' transmission lines and other assets, because then the utilities could pay their past-due bills. The governor said last week that he expected a deal with the utilities by today, but that might not happen. ""Clearly, there's been challenges getting long-term contracts, but we've turned the corner,"" said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio. ""We've got three in the bank and 10 more once we get these deals (with the utilities) done."" Also Thursday, the Public Utilities Commission was poised to allow the state to collect the entire amount that customers pay specifically for electricity. But Pacific Gas & Electric Co. said it is entitled to deduct other costs from customers' payments before reimbursing the state. That would reduce payments from PG&E to the state by about half, according to the company. The PUC proposal was in response to a request from the state Department of Water Resources that it be allowed to start collecting money so that energy companies would be more willing to sell power to the agency. The two Republican-appointed commissioners of the PUC blocked the move, which needed four of five commissioners' approval to reach the agenda. ""DWR's (action) is exacerbating a problem AB1X was meant to alleviate,"" said Commissioner Richard Bilas. ""It is pushing the utilities closer to bankruptcy."" PG&E spokesman John Nelson said the proposal brought by PUC President Loretta Lynch would have been unfair to the utilities because AB1X allows them to deduct expenses for buying electricity and generating energy at their own power plants before reimbursing the state. ""All of those costs need to be paid going forward. Otherwise, you still leave the utilities to bleed,"" Nelson said. That stance appeared to be at odds with the office of Assemblyman Fred Keeley, the Boulder Creek Democrat who wrote AB1X. ""For PG&E to think it can keep money for electrons it never even owned is astounding to us,"" said Guy Phillips, a Keeley aide. While nothing has gone smoothly, Phillips and others expressed optimism that the state's biggest effort to date to fix the energy crisis would work. ""We think those will be sorted out,"" said Phillips, who acknowledged there has been much confusion about what lawmakers intended in AB1X. For example, Keeley's office said lawmakers wanted the water resources agency to make up the entire amount of electricity that the state's two largest utilities had not secured ahead of time. The high cost of this last-minute electricity -- and the utilities' heavy reliance on it -- is what drove PG&E and Southern California Edison to the brink of bankruptcy. But the water agency has balked at buying electricity offered at prices it calls ""unreasonable."" While state officials have refused to say how much electricity it has left to utilities to purchase, the state is paying about $55 million a day to keep electricity flowing. And that amounts to about 90 percent of the electricity purchased on behalf of the utilities on the same day it is needed, according to Phillips. The state's reluctance to buy all of the so-called real-time electricity has led to fears that the utilities will continue to run up debt and that power companies will not collect money owed to them. That dispute has landed in federal court, where a Sacramento judge is forcing three major power suppliers and a marketing company to continue selling power in the state. If a settlement is not reached today, U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell is expected to decide whether to extend his order, to modify it or to drop it. Staff writer Andrew LaMar contributed to this story. Lowenthal returns utility money By Will Shuck From our Sacramento Bureau SACRAMENTO Assemblyman Alan Lowenthal, D-Long Beach, this week joined a small group of legislators who returned campaign contributions to California utility companies and other energy firms. He sent $5,000 back to Southern California Edison and $500 to Sempra Energy, parent company of Southern California Gas. It was a small portion of the more than Lowenthal $500,000 Lowenthal had raised in 2000 for his re-election campaign. He said he returned the money, as did nine other Assembly members, at the urging of the consumer advocacy group Global Exchange. ""We think it's fantastic that he has recognized that in the eyes of the public there is a very serious potential conflict of interest,"" said group spokeswoman Medea Benjamin. ""We applaud him for wanting to ensure the integrity of the legislative process."" While Benjamin says it's critical that lawmakers not be tainted by energy money during the state's power crisis, others wonder where the line should be drawn. ""In the real world of politics it costs money to run for office and you have to get that money somewhere,"" said Paul Schmidt, a political science professor at Cal State Long Beach. ""To say that you can only make decisions on things involving individuals that haven't given you any money would result in paralysis of government."" Benjamin and other consumer advocates say the power crisis calls for special consideration. ""There are not many cases in which they're actually voting whether a company will survive with billions of dollars of taxpayer money or go bankrupt, as they're doing with the utility companies,"" Benjamin said. Lowenthal agreed. ""I thought it was an appropriate request,"" he said. ""These are unique circumstances, and I just think it's in the public's best interest that I return that money."" Dan Walters: A power grab by politicians (Published Feb. 23, 2001) Slowly, but inexorably, control over the generation, acquisition and distribution of electric power in California is being shifted from professional utility managers and independent regulators into the hands of politicians. The 1996 utility ""deregulation"" scheme enacted by the Legislature was an initial foray into politicization. Legislation granting the governor more control over the makeup of the Public Utilities Commission was another. But the current power supply/price crisis has led to even more direct political influence over -- or interference with -- electric service. One hastily enacted bill, for example, gives the governor direct control of the now-misnamed ""Independent System Operator,"" which operates the statewide power grid. More political intrusion is in the works, from a state takeover of the intercity power transmission grid to the creation of a state power authority that would buy, generate and sell electricity directly. And while local public utilities function well, a state power agency might operate on the whims of professional politicians. The Legislature, for example, wants appointments to the board that would direct a state power authority, and big state power projects would be subject to the same kind of pork-barrel mentality that distorts other public works appropriations. Where power plants were to be built, or where high-voltage lines would be strung, might well depend on who could, and could not, bring political influence to bear, rather than what the system needed to work efficiently. Clues to the potential pitfalls of a state-operated power system are found in the approaches of Capitol politicians to the current crisis. There is, for example, the unspoken goal of avoiding big power rate boosts until after the November 2002 election -- even if it means running up billions of dollars in debts to do it. Would future rates charged by a state power authority be raised or lowered to enhance the prospects of the dominant party or an incumbent governor? There's no evidence in past performances to indicate they wouldn't be. And then there's the knotty question of who would get vital power supplies in the event of shortages -- a situation that is already looming and could become worse in future months. Emergency legislation already gives the state the right to sell power as it pleases, without competitive bidding or even public notice. There's nothing, really, to prevent politically influential power customers such as big industrial enterprises from cutting their own supply deals with politically directed state officials. And whose juice would be cut off if shortages mean blackouts? Approximately 45 percent of current power customers are effectively exempt from rolling blackouts because they are connected to circuits (called ""blocks"") that also include vital services, such as hospitals, fire and police agencies, water supply systems and communications centers. The Capitol, not surprisingly, is in one of those noninterruptible blocks. With the threat of further blackouts looming, legislation is being drafted to designate which customers will suffer and which will not -- thus taking that authority out of the hands of utilities and regulators. And that, in turn, is generating pressure from lobbyists from all sorts of interest groups to place their clients on protected lists. Should farmers be cut off, or biotechnology facilities, or computer chip plants, or schools? When politicians control any process or system, one can be certain that they will always make expedient political decisions, regardless of the long-term or wider consequences. Thus, we may someday regret allowing the Capitol's self-serving politicians to get their hands on our electric power system. Discount Urged Near Power Plants Senator urges electricity rate break for neighbors of generators Friday,?February 23, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle As California officials propose building 32 new ""peaker"" power plants across the state by July, one legislator from plant-rich eastern Contra Costa County thinks residents should get a discount on their power bill for having a generator in their backyard. The proposed bill would provide a little payback for residents of state Sen. Tom Torlakson's district, which is home to a half-dozen plants and has three more in the construction pipeline. Under the bill introduced yesterday by Torlakson, D-Antioch, people living within a 20-mile circle around a power plant would receive a 20 percent discount on their electricity bill and be exempt from blackouts. The legislation was partially inspired by San Jose officials' rejecting a proposal to build a 600-megawatt power plant in the Coyote Valley, as well as Gov. Gray Davis' plan to build 5,000 megawatts of new generating capacity by July 1. ""It's a question of fairness,"" Torlakson said. ""People in communities who are shouldering the burden for having plants in their backyard should get some benefit from it."" Torlakson said consumers who lived in communities without plants could pick up the tab for the discounts. ""But the utilities would have to figure that out within their rate system,"" he said. A PG&E spokesman said yesterday that the company does not comment on pending legislation. While consumer advocates, environmentalists and power generators were lukewarm to the proposal yesterday, many admit that the state has not thought about how to -- of even if they have to -- offer communities a little incentive to approve a power plant within their borders. However, the state has allocated $30 million for plants that get online by July 1. ""As far as incentives, I'd think most communities would see the value of the employment they'd get and the increase to the tax base,"" said Larry Hamlin, the governor's recently appointed project manager for the plant-building campaign. A spokesman for California's Environmental Protection Agency, which permits plants, said the plan might be a ""worthwhile idea for making power plants more palatable to Californians."" Michael Shames, head of Utility Consumer Action Network in San Diego said the bill was attacking a ""not in my back yard"" problem that doesn't exist. ""Many San Diego communities are clamoring for plants in the hope that they would bring stability to the market,"" he said. James Peters of Mirent, the Atlanta-based company formerly known as Southern Energy, said the plan wouldn't encourage generators to build the number of plants needed to solve the energy crisis. Already, communities like Pittsburg have cut deals with power generators before letting them build. In exchange for letting the Calpine Corp. build two large plants in town, Pittsburg received the lifetime option to purchase 100 megawatts of power at below-market rates. Next week, a Pittsburg group is going to begin gathering signatures demanding that city leaders use the estimated 26 megawatts it would take to light residences and businesses to give local residents a break on bills. The group will hold an organizational meeting at 7 p.m. Tuesday at the Los Medanos Community Hospital, 2311 Loveridge Rd. in Pittsburg. At last, power alerts are lifted: Enjoy respite because crisis far from resolved, experts say By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer (Published Feb. 23, 2001) As oddly as it arrived, California's electric emergency lifted Thursday morning. At 9 a.m., the Independent System Operator, which controls most of California's grid, ended a Stage 1 alert. It was the first time since Jan. 13 that the state hadn't been under a power emergency, declared when low supplies threaten grid stability. The alerts included 32 straight days of Stage 3 emergencies, the black clouds that gather before rotating outages. The clouds cleared on a day when predicted peak use was low -- but not the lowest it has been for the last five weeks. Many power plants were back on line after repairs -- but more plants had been operating during at least one Stage 3 day. So what happened? A little luck, a little planning and maybe a little group psychology, said those who have closely watched recent gyrations of the state's electric roller coaster. ""It is a roll of the dice,"" said Gary Ackerman, head of the Western Power Trading Forum, which represents plant owners and marketers. ""If it continues for the next three or four weeks I wouldn't be too surprised. That'll be our respite. Enjoy it."" The end of a 40-day string of emergencies could mean a few more lights in store aisles or a little less worry about running an electric furnace. Some speculated it might also mean lower wholesale prices. But major changes are not likely in the steady rain of conservation calls that have fallen on Californians since the north state was twice plunged into rotating blackouts last month. ""I hope people don't just go back to wasteful ways,"" said Mike Florio of The Utility Reform Network, a consumer group. Now that the emergencies have dissipated, ""we don't have to talk about imposing hardships on people, but prudent use of energy is an idea we're going to have to live with for a long time,"" he said. At the ISO, longer days and slightly warmer weather was credited with decreasing peak demand for electricity. Supplies are up within the state, and power imports from the Pacific Northwest have risen significantly, said Jim Detmers, who manages grid operations. Plus, in one of the biggest changes, the state Department of Water Resources has begun getting more power supplies lined up at least a day in advance, he said. Since the department stepped in to buy power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities, it has often managed to line up about 70 percent to 75 percent of what the state needed to supplement utility-controlled supplies, according to Detmers. That meant grid operators had to scramble to buy the rest on very short notice. But starting last Friday, the state began to schedule about 90 percent of its purchases at least one day in advance. ""The operators are able to enter a day with a lot more confidence about being able to make it,"" Detmers said. ""You don't have to search to find those megawatts at the last minute."" Closely in sync with increased purchases by the state, the ISO dropped from a Stage 3 emergency to Stage 2 on Friday, and then slid to a Stage 1 Wednesday. The stages are based on how much reserve power is left for unexpected crises; a Stage 3 is declared when reserves slip below 1.5 percent. For their part, power buyers at the water resources department weren't sure what has made the difference over the past few days. ""It's certainly not that people are lining up to sell us power at cheap prices,"" said Jim Spence, the department's director of emergency operations. ""We're just buying whatever we can, and it turned out that it was easier to make ends meet."" He said he couldn't make any prediction about how long that would last. The string of power emergencies has been unpredictable from the start, erupting in winter, when California's hunger for electricity traditionally declines and supplies are usually so flush that plants close for tune-ups. Consumer advocates and power traders blamed finances for the emergencies, rather than a fundamental lack of supply, as fears of utility bankruptcies triggered a descent into market chaos and high-stakes political maneuvering. But basic supply shortages are expected to move to the forefront by summer, when temperatures rise and demand soars. Meanwhile, the brief respite -- whatever the reason -- brought palpable relief to those charged with keeping the power grid stable. ""When we found out yesterday during the board meeting that we were only in Stage 1, we broke out in applause,"" said Florio, who sits on the five-member ISO board. The change also could be good news for consumers, who may one day be paying higher rates for the wholesale electricity now being purchased by the state. ""Getting out of a Stage 3 typically means prices are going to ease,"" Florio said. ""When you're even in a Stage 1, that's a signal to everybody, 'They're short, that means we can hold them up now.' "" Davis' deadlines on energy much easier set than met By Emily Bazar Bee Staff Writer (Published Feb. 23, 2001) Exactly one week ago, Gov. Gray Davis sounded hopeful, optimistic even, when he predicted that the state and its debt-ridden utilities would forge an agreement by today on a plan to save the companies from financial doom. Problem is, it won't work out that way. Negotiations between state officials and the investor-owned utilities have produced no comprehensive agreement to announce today. Davis' predictions during the energy crisis have been wrong before. For weeks, he has set deadlines for agreements and legislative action that haven't been met. On deadline days, even when there's little substantive progress to report, Davis often holds news conferences anyway -- many of them on Friday afternoons after financial markets close. The Democratic governor's office scheduled an ""announcement"" for today in Los Angeles, even though one utility representative said agreement is far away. Davis' actions have fueled speculation that he's trying to force consensus by setting artificial deadlines and putting a spin on the news, and tarnishing the state's credibility in the process. ""I can't see how you would negotiate such a complex deal, like the purchase of the transmission grid, in such a short period of time. It doesn't seem realistic,"" said Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, an association of wholesale generators. ""I guess the people I represent have turned it off. They have stopped listening. They hear it and say, 'OK, sure. Here's another photo op.' "" Last Friday, Davis told a gathering of reporters that state officials and the utilities would agree by today on a rescue plan for the utilities. ""I believe we'll have agreement before next week is out, on exactly what should go in a piece of legislation,"" he said at the time. ""And hopefully, that legislation will be passed by the end of the following week."" Legislative veterans said his comments were ill-advised and unrealistic. Davis met into the night Thursday with top officials of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., but no agrement was reached. ""These are complicated problems that will not be solved overnight,"" said PG&E spokesman Ron Low. ""On some issues, we are very far away from agreement."" Sources said PG&E has been unwilling to negotiate sale of its transmission lines, which Davis has said is a necessary component of a deal. More progress was reported with the two other near-bankrupt companies -- San Diego Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison -- although sources said talks with them were far from concluded. Davis has been setting specific deadlines for himself and the Legislature for months: In November, the governor promised to present a comprehensive ""plan"" by Dec. 1 to stave off a full-blown energy crisis, but ended up offering only a modest slate of proposals. Davis called Feb. 12 a ""drop dead"" date by which he hoped to cement a deal between lawmakers and the utilities. There's no deal yet. Davis told reporters that he and the state's legislative leaders would reach a ""consensus agreement"" on the proposal to take to utilities by last Friday. It didn't happen; he made the announcement alone. Leon Panetta, a White House chief of staff under former President Clinton, said it's important that the governor set deadlines because the nature of politics is to delay. However, he cautioned against missing deadlines. ""You have to be careful that you keep the deadlines you establish, because the more that you establish and not meet, the more that begins to lose its value as a political tool,"" Panetta said. The governor can't continue to indefinitely set deadlines without facing consequences, cautioned Steven Fetter, managing director of the Global Power Group at Fitch, a credit-rating agency based in New York. At some point, he warned, creditors and power suppliers may push the utilities into involuntary bankruptcy, which would trigger an official deadline that can't be ignored. The dispute would be tied up in court at a judge's discretion. ""Eventually, there is going to be a real deadline,"" Fetter said. ""The problem is it's probably not a deadline that will be set by Gov. Davis. It's a deadline that will be set by the banks and the (electricity) suppliers."" In several cases when deadlines haven't been met, Davis has held a news conference regardless, unveiling little new information and scant detail. On Jan. 26, for instance, the governor promoted the broad framework of a plan to save the utilities rather than a detailed plan that had been anticipated. One prong of the plan: ""Aggressively promote energy efficiency, conservation and demand reduction among consumers, businesses and public entities."" Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said that the governor continues to set deadlines because it's important to show that the state is making progress, particularly to Wall Street. He added that it's not the governor's fault the deadlines have been missed. ""Many of the dates have been blown away by factors no one has been able to foresee or have control over: court decisions, actions by creditors, weather, you name it,"" Maviglio said. ""The governor sets deadlines that continue to move the ball forward and he has been successful at doing that."" Many of these announcements came after 2 p.m. on Fridays, triggering suggestions that the governor has attempted to spin the facts and manipulate the markets. Timing announcements after the close of East Coast financial markets is commonly used by politicians who don't want to send stocks soaring or tumbling by making an announcement, Panetta said. ""You want people to evaluate what's happening so there isn't a panic reaction to a news flash going over the wire,"" he said. But market analysts say that ever since PG&E and Edison stocks plummeted in early January, the governor's statements haven't significantly affected their performance. ""There has been so much news that has been so negative for the companies that I don't think it makes much of a difference,"" said Ed Schuller, a senior vice president for the full-service brokerage firm Sutro & Co. ""It's beyond that point now."" GOP Sees Power Crisis as Davis' Achilles' Heel Republicans line up to run for governor Friday,?February 23, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, politically wounded by the state's power woes, has become the target of a growing pack of Republicans looking to turn him out of office. ""Four months ago, Davis looked on track to get re-elected by a voice vote,"" said Dan Schnur, a GOP strategist. ""But the energy crisis has exposed vulnerabilities that have encouraged others to look at the (2002 governor's) race."" The governor's backers, however, are confident California voters will recognize Davis is dealing with a problem that has been brewing for years, through previous Republican administrations. ""If the Republicans want to have a full-out firefight over who brought this (energy crisis) down, we're ready for it,"" said Garry South, the governor's top political adviser. ""It's a fight they can't win."" With the primary election still more than a year away, no one but Davis is a sure bet to leap into the contest, but at least three names will be circulating when California Republicans meet in Sacramento this weekend for their state convention. Secretary of State Bill Jones, Los Angeles investor Bill Simon Jr. and actor Arnold Schwarzenegger all have made noises about challenging Davis, but so far their incipient campaigns have been more talk than action. Simon's effort might be the farthest along, but he also has the longest way to travel. A political unknown, the 49-year-old Simon runs his family's investment company and has been active in a number of charitable organizations in Southern California. Simon, whose father was treasury secretary under President Richard Nixon, has brought in veteran GOP consultant Sal Russo to study a possible run for governor. ""Bill Simon feels we need a governor who's prepared to lead and not one who's focused on fund-raising or the next political office,"" Russo said in a jab at Davis. Simon was an assistant U.S. attorney in New York, but founded William E. Simon & Sons with his brother and late father in 1988. The $2 billion private investment firm owns a number of companies and has also invested heavily in South of Market real estate in San Francisco. Wealthy political outsiders don't have an enviable record in recent California elections. Republican Michael Huffington spent $29 million to lose a 1994 Senate race to Dianne Feinstein. Darrell Issa dropped around $13 million in a losing race for the 1998 GOP Senate nomination. Al Checchi spent about $38 million of his own money to lose the Democratic primary to Davis in 1998. While Simon likely would be spending plenty of his own money on a governor's bid, he's working to get outside support, both political and financial, before committing to the race, Russo said. With the state's problems mounting and the economy increasingly shaky, the time may be ripe for a political unknown, he added. ""When things start going bad, people are willing to look outside for a new face, someone who will get things done,"" Russo said. Jones is anything but a political outsider. A veteran legislator from the Fresno area, he is now serving his second and last term as California's secretary of state. He managed to hang onto his job during the GOP's 1998 electoral debacle, which cost the party every other constitutional office. While Jones has long talked about a run for governor, he's still playing coy. ""We have not made any decision and probably won't make one until early March,"" said Rob Lapsley, one of Jones' top advisers. ""Right now we're putting together information for Bill to make a decision."" While Jones' role as the state's top GOP officeholder makes him an obvious choice to challenge Davis, he's made a number of political enemies over the years, many of them in his own party. His surprise decision last year to switch his support from George W. Bush to Arizona Sen. John McCain in California's presidential primary won him no fans among Bush supporters and could hurt his attempts to raise money for a gubernatorial bid. Money is a major problem for Jones, who listed $118,000 in his campaign fund last month, compared with nearly $26 million for Davis. Some of his opponents have suggested that fund-raising woes may force Jones to run for an office other than governor. ""Right now, we're focused on the governor's race,"" Lapsley insisted. The real Republican wild card is Schwarzenegger, the movie action hero who would be instantly recognized by nearly every California voter. While Schwarzenegger's publicist told The Chronicle last month that he had no plans to get involved in next year's governor's race, the Austrian-born star was on the telephone to a Los Angeles Times columnist days later, talking about his love for politics and his political ambitions. Fame, however, has its drawbacks, as the 53-year-old Schwarzenegger has found. An article in Premiere magazine entitled ""Arnold the Barbarian"" accused him of groping women on movie sets and generally boorish behavior, while the supermarket tabloids have him on the cover this week, suggesting that his marriage to Maria Shriver is on the rocks. South, Davis' political adviser, gleefully sent copies of the Premiere article to reporters across the state, suggesting that ""the piece lays out a real 'touching' story -- if you get what I mean."" Whoever ends up with the GOP nomination still will face an uphill battle against Davis, a popular governor and a ""take no prisoners"" campaigner. ""I've been predicting since Day One that the GOP would find some moneybags candidate to throw against Gray,"" South said. ""That's why we've kept our political and fund-raising operation going since election day."" Pressure Is on Utilities to Accept Grid Sale Energy: Gov. Davis wants accord today, but Edison executive says company might prefer bankruptcy. By DAN MORAIN and NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writers ?????SACRAMENTO--His credibility at risk and California's energy future on the line, Gov. Gray Davis on Thursday turned up the heat on the state's utilities to accept today a series of tentative rescue accords that would put the companies' transmission systems into public hands. ?????How far the utilities are willing to bend to the governor's intensified pressure was unclear late Thursday. Given Davis' mandate, a top executive of Southern California Edison said his company is now being forced to seriously contemplate whether it might fare better in Bankruptcy Court. ?????""We are weighing two very unpalatable alternatives,"" he said. ?????Two alternatives facing the utilities are either to sell their electrical transmission systems to the state at a price they consider too low or gamble in Bankruptcy Court that they could hang onto their valuable assets. ?????After nearly a week of negotiations, Davis administration officials said they hoped to announce today a partial deal that would calm the utilities' jittery creditors and help subdue California's runaway electricity market. ?????State officials said Thursday they were close to agreements with Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric but remained at odds with the state's biggest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, which has balked at giving up its transmission grid. ?????""These are complex issues that cannot be resolved overnight,"" said PG&E spokesman Ron Lowe. ""There are clearly some areas where we are very far apart."" ?????On Thursday, Edison Chairman John Bryson conferred with members of his utility's board of directors. But by evening, the company's top executives still had not decided whether to acknowledge that an agreement is near. ?????Although the utility has begun to contemplate the protections of bankruptcy, it is unclear when, or if, such a dramatic action would occur. ?????Davis is believed to be offering roughly $7 billion for the utilities' transmission grids. The companies could use the cash to restructure their debt, which resulted from the utilities' inability to pass along their soaring wholesale electricity costs to ratepayers. ?????Davis has significant political and fiscal reasons for wanting to make an announcement today. He is scheduled to arrive in Washington for the National Governor's Assn. conference this weekend, meet with U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham on Sunday, and attend the Democratic Governors Assn. annual fund-raising dinner Monday night. ?????Davis, a prodigious fund-raiser, is chairman of the Democratic Governors Assn., and the dinner is expected to raise more than $5 million. Of that amount, Davis' political organization raised in excess of $1 million, said Garry South, his chief political advisor. ?????Any progress Davis can cite could help improve his national political standing. But his aides say it's especially important to be able to show at least a semblance of an agreement when he travels to New York on Wednesday to confer with Wall Street analysts. ?????On Thursday, those analysts reacted exuberantly to early hints from the governor's office that settlements with the utilities might be announced. ?????The recently anemic stocks of Edison International and PG&E Corp. soared on the New York Stock Exchange on a day when most utility stocks closed lower. ?????Edison jumped $1.50 per share, or 11.15%, to close at $14.95 while PG&E gained $1.49, or 11.41%, to $14.55 per share. ?????""That suggests that someone thinks something good is happening in Sacramento,"" said analyst James D. von Riesemann of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. ?????But some analysts fear investor enthusiasm might be hasty. ?????""I'm concerned that the governor's optimism may not coincide with all the parties at the table and it may not coincide with the Legislature,"" said Paul Patterson, utility analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. ?????Davis met Thursday with Steve Baum, chairman of Sempra, the parent company of SDG&E. Administration officials are confident that an agreement can be reached. But the San Diego company is the smallest of the state's three major private utilities, and its debt is far smaller--$605 million, compared to the combined $12.7 billion that Edison and PG&E say they have amassed. ?????""[Baum] is willing to listen,"" said Sempra spokesman Doug Kline. "" . . . We're on the record as stating that we are willing to consider the sale of those [transmission] assets if it helps solve the crisis."" ?????PG&E executives had been scheduled to start meeting with Davis at 11 a.m. Thursday. But in what was seen a slight against PG&E, Davis' aides did not summon negotiators for the Northern California utility, including company Chairman Robert Glynn, until after 3:30. ?????Although the parties continued to wrangle over details, there was progress Thursday on the sidelines. ?????State officials announced they had signed a long-term contract for a relatively small amount of electricity with a major energy supplier--an achievement that was perhaps more symbolic than substantive. ?????Tulsa-based Williams Cos. said it had agreed to a 10-year deal to sell power to the Department of Water Resources. By April, the company will provide at least 175 megawatts--enough electricity to supply 175,000 homes--at times of the day when demand for electricity soars. Such peak supplies will increase through next summer and reach 900 megawatts by 2006, according to Williams. ?????The agreement is only the second such long-term contract since Davis signed a bill Feb. 1 putting the Department of Water Resources into the power-buying business for many years to come. ?????At least 10 other power suppliers have reached understandings with the state, Davis said Wednesday. But those companies refuse to sign deals, the governor said, until the state finds a way to help California's two biggest utilities pay off their billion-dollar debts. ?????""As soon as we revitalize the utilities,"" the governor said, ""I think you'll see a lot of movement on long-term contracts."" ?????Another small but important piece of the state's energy plan emerged Thursday when legislation was introduced by Sen. Jim Battin (R-La Quinta) to slash the rates paid to alternative energy producers--a move expected to shave $3 billion or more in annual costs charged to the big private utilities. Reducing the amount paid to producers of renewable energy such as solar, wind and biomass power is considered a crucial step in keeping expected consumer rate hikes down. ?????And, after 40 days of dangerously low electricity supplies, the state got a reprieve Thursday morning when grid officials lifted the state's ""electrical emergency"" status for the first time since Jan. 13. ?????So far, the state has spent nearly $2 billion buying electricity on behalf of the utilities, according to the Department of Finance, which informed the Legislature on Thursday that it will release another $500 million for electricity purchases. --- ?????Times staff writers Nancy Rivera Brooks, Nancy Cleeland and Mitchell Landsberg in Los Angeles and Julie Tamaki and Jenifer Warren in Sacramento contributed to this story. Energy Firms Won't Pay All of Monster Debt PUC reverses, taxpayers could foot the bill Christian Berthelsen, Chronicle Staff Writer Friday,?February 23, 2001 Under a ruling yesterday by state regulators, California taxpayers could be on the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars in power purchases the state has made in behalf of two troubled utilities. The California Public Utilities Commission voted unanimously to absolve Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison of responsibility for any costs above the revenue they collect from ratepayers. The ruling reversed a position taken earlier by the commission, which had said the utilities were responsible for making up the difference between the state's costs and their own revenue. John Tremaine, a PG&E spokesman, said the funding needed to make up the difference could come in the form of a surcharge imposed on customers who use 130 percent of the baseline amount of electricity. That is one option under a bill passed last month by the Legislature, he said. But Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, said the governor does not believe the money will come from ratepayers' electric bills. The costs, Maviglio said, could be covered by the $10 billion bond measure the state recently issued to cover power purchases. As California tries to resolve its power crisis, state officials are working out the precise way that should be done. Under the state's deregulation plan approved in 1996, the utilities have been forced to absorb skyrocketing wholesale electricity costs while being prevented by law from passing the increases on to customers through higher rates. Since the California Department of Water Resources began buying power last month, details showing how it will be repaid, how much or by whom have not been established. Yesterday's PUC decision was an attempt to begin setting the repayment criteria. A precise accounting of how much money is at stake is impossible to determine at this point, officials said, because PG&E declines to release ratepayer revenue figures, and the state is refusing to say exactly how much it has spent buying power. Officials estimate the state will spend $2.3 billion by the beginning of March and Davis authorized the expenditure of $500 million more yesterday. The state's Department of Water Resources became the buyer of record on Jan. 17 when the two utilities' credit was so damaged that they were no longer able to buy power. Both utilities had opposed the commission's previous position that they be responsible for all power costs. The PUC's shift yesterday was summed up by Commissioner Richard Bilas, who said he could not support holding the utilities responsible for the revenue shortfall. ""The DWR is not about to go bankrupt; the utilities are,"" he said. Yet consumer advocates downplayed the commission's ruling yesterday. Nettie Hoge, executive director of The Utility Reform Network, said the ruling only dealt with the narrow issue of who has to account for the revenue shortfall, and did not reach an overarching decision about who, ultimately, will be financially responsible for it. ""This is not a huge deal,"" she said. The state has been buying the lion's share of its power in the real-time market run by the Independent System Operator since the demise of the longer- term California Power Exchange, said Jesus Arredondo, a spokesman for the exchange. The state has been paying premium prices because it is buying in a market that was designed to handle last-minute emergencies. The governor's office has been seeking cheaper, long-term power contracts with only modest results. Small electric producers OK big price cut By Ed Mendel STAFF WRITER February 23, 2001 SACRAMENTO -- Legislators said yesterday that small generators who produce about 30 percent of the state's power have agreed to cut their power prices in half, an important step toward easing the electricity crisis. Negotiations continued on what Gov. Gray Davis has called the final step: the state purchase of the transmission systems of the three investor-owned utilities in exchange for paying off their huge debt. Meanwhile, the amount that the state is spending to buy power for the customers of the utilities grows. Officials gave notice that an additional $500 million will be needed in 10 days, bringing the total to $2.6 billion. But for the first time in nearly six weeks the state did not declare an alert yesterday due to power shortages. More power was available from other states, and some power plants that had been shut down for maintenance resumed operation. Two legislators, Sen. Jim Battin, R-Palm Desert, and Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, said they introduced legislation that sharply reduces the prices paid to small generators after weeks of difficult negotiations. ""Ultimately, this bill will reduce the cost of energy to the state and its ratepayers by billions of dollars,"" said Battin, who represents eastern San Diego County. About half of the small generators use ""renewable"" technologies such as solar, wind, geothermal and biomass. The rest is ""co-generation,"" when fuel is used for industrial purposes and electricity is generated as a by-product. The small generators have grown to produce nearly a third of California's power under a two-decade-old federal ""qualifying facilities"" program, which requires utilities to buy their power. Battin and Keeley said that under the bill, SB 47X, the average price for these QF contracts could drop from the current 17 cents per kilowatt-hour to about 8 to 8.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. ""We believe that the rates are at least that low, if not lower,"" said Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers, which represents small and large generators. The small generators support the bill because it will give them a stable price for five years, avoiding ups and downs and the possibility that state regulators might make a more unfavorable price cut. Much of the current price formula is based on the price of natural gas at the California border, which has soared this winter. The legislation spreads the price bench mark over a five-year period. ""We encourage the Legislature to take quick action to approve SB 47X as quickly as possible to help stabilize the electricity crisis,"" Smutny-Jones said. He said one of the side agreements to the legislation is the creation of a portfolio of long-term contracts to purchase natural gas for some co-generators, lowering their production costs. The legislation was applauded as ""a major step forward"" by a group of small generators who formed a creditors committee last week and threatened to take the utilities into bankruptcy. ""We call on the Legislature and the governor to act on it immediately,"" said Chris Thompson, a spokesman for the group. Thompson said Southern California Edison continues to collect money from ratepayers, as the state buys power for its customers, but is not paying anything to the small non-polluting generators. A spokesman for a geothermal generator in El Centro, which filed a lawsuit seeking $45 million from Edison for power provided since November, welcomed the legislation for giving generators stability and ratepayers cheaper power. But Vince Signorotti, a spokesman for CalEnergy, said it would be ""premature"" to consider dropping the lawsuit. Battin and Keeley said that payment of the small generators depends on the governor's attempt to negotiate the purchase of the transmission systems of Edison, Pacific Gas and Electric, and San Diego Gas and Electric in exchange for payment of their debt. As part of the governor's plan, the utilities would agree to provide low-cost power for five to 10 years from their generators, which provide about a third of the state's power. Davis aides are attempting to negotiate long-term contracts with generators for the remaining third of the power required by the state, sharply reducing the cost of buying power on the expensive spot market. But the governor said this week that many generators are reluctant to sign long-term contracts until they know how the utilities will pay their debt for previous power purchases. The state called off all power alerts yesterday for the first time since mid-January, rescinding a Stage 1 alert declared Wednesday. Grid operators made the change after increased power supplies became available. ""The supply situation this week has gradually been improving,"" said Lorie O'Donley, a spokeswoman with the California Independent System Operator, which manages most of the state's power supplies. However, she said the improvements shouldn't deter consumers from conservation. ""It is good news to be out of electrical emergencies but we just want to remind everybody that we are looking at a long-term power supply situation here,"" she said. ""And the high-demand summer is just around the corner. So we would ask that people continue with their conservation efforts."" In San Francisco yesterday, state power regulators decided unanimously that the Department of Water Resources is responsible for buying any power that cash-strapped utilities are unable to generate or buy on their own -- no matter what price wholesalers are charging. But the PUC voted 3-2 against taking action that would have allowed the DWR to receive a portion of ratepayer revenues from the utilities to help cover the cost of buying electricity. The state, through the DWR, was authorized by a recent law to buy power for the utilities. Edison and PG&E have such low credit ratings that no power companies will sell to them. SDG&E's rating is much better, but its debt also was mounting. The DWR purchases that portion of electricity beyond what the utilities provide through their own generating plants and through existing long-term contracts. But the DWR has refused to buy power beyond a certain price. That means more last-minute power purchases on the expensive spot market. The utilities and the state had disagreed over how the DWR will be reimbursed -- whether through state bonds or ratepayer dollars -- and the extent of its power-buying role. The author of the bill authorizing the long-term contracts, Assemblyman Keeley, said the legislation's intent was to fully cover the one-third of the power that utilities purchased on the spot market, either through extended contracts or through the state ISO.

<11372541.1075862241188.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,RTO Legal Question,"I am working on an analysis of the details of the Barton draft RTO language. While it is highly objectionable and our goal is to kill it, to do so we need to respond to requests to be specific about why we don't like it. One of the more objectionable provisions says that FERC can't change the scope, governance, etc. of any RTO that has been ""approved"" under Order 2000 prior to enactment of the legislation. If this applies to PJM, the legislation would stop the Northeast-wide RTO in its tracks since several of you and PJM's Phil Harris testified last week that FERC has ""approved"" PJM. By contrast, committee staff and the section-by-section they distributed on the RTO legislative proposal say that to date FERC has NOT approved any RTOs under Order 2000. They say that the legislative language would not apply to any RTO as of this date because FERC approvals of PJM, Cal ISO and NePool have been approved under the ""ISO principles"" of Order 888. Your thoughts on the above would be helpful. Either way, I think we can argue that the provision shows why the Barton proposal is a retrenchment rather than an advancement on RTOs. If it does not apply to PJM and the others as they contend, there is no good reason to include it other than to ""freeze"" the process at FERC merely by having the legislation pending on the Hill, much less enacted into law.",Company Business/Strategy

<25089651.1075843013297.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,"San Jose Mercury News - California Officials Investigate Electric
 'Megawatt Laundering'","California Officials Investigate Electric 'Megawatt Laundering' Steve Johnson , San Jose Mercury News, Calif. ( October 31, 2000 ) Oct. 30--While investigating this summer's stunning spike in electricity prices, state authorities have heard stories about a curious phenomenon: On days when the weather is hot, batches of power generated in California are sold to other states. A little later in the day, similar amounts of power are sold back to California -- but at much higher prices. The question is, is it the same power? If so, that could be ""megawatt laundering"" -- a multi-company conspiracy to evade California's wholesale price cap, which covers power generated in California but not power sold into California from elsewhere. Worried that such transactions could be costing consumers millions of dollars, several energy specialists raised concerns about megawatt laundering during a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission hearing a month ago in San Diego. And earlier this month, state Sen. Steve Peace, D-La Mesa -- who helped lead the push to deregulate electricity sales in California -- formally asked the commission to investigate the practice, which he termed ""potentially illegal market coordination."" But an unconfirmed news report last week said the federal agency had concluded that generators had not abused the market. And others say concerns about megawatt laundering are exaggerated. Among them is Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers Association, a power-firm trade group, and chairman of the Independent System Operator, which oversees most of California's power grid. While acknowledging that such laundering is possible, Smutny-Jones said there is no evidence it is actually occurring or is widespread. ""This is one of those things that's turning into an urban legend,"" he said. ""I don't want to characterize this as a significant problem."" Even some critics of the way power is purchased in California concede that most of what has been labeled megawatt laundering probably reflects nothing more sinister than the ability of some entrepreneurs to take advantage of a good deal when they see one. Nonetheless, they see evidence that at least some California-produced power is being sold out of and back into the state at a higher price. And they blame that on loopholes in the system that they say ought to be closed because the transactions are helping to drive up the cost of power. The Independent System Operator ""invites this type of activity,"" said Frank Wolak, a Stanford economist who chairs the non-profit corporation's market surveillance committee, which has warned of the potential for megawatt laundering in at least two reports this year. ""The thing that makes all these problems go is the fact that the ISO has said, `We'll pay whatever it takes to keep the lights on,' and that's screwing consumers big time."" In 1998, when the state's energy markets were deregulated, it was generally assumed that opening up the sale of electricity to competition would make power less expensive. As a precaution, however, officials at the Independent System Operator instituted wholesale price caps, which they lowered twice this summer to help keep a lid on costs. On July 1 this year, they reduced the cap from $750 per megawatt per hour to $500, one megawatt being sufficient power for 1,000 homes. Then, on Aug. 7, they cut it to $250. Unfortunately, things haven't worked out the way officials had hoped. Wholesale prices rose dramatically this year. And while a freeze on retail utility rates has temporarily shielded Pacific Gas & Electric Co. customers from those soaring costs, home electricity prices have tripled in San Diego, where a similar freeze already has come off. In the process, some generators learned that all it takes to get around the state's wholesale price caps is a basic understanding of how the market works. One of the best ways to get top dollar, they learned, was to hold off selling their electricity until the Independent System Operator issues what is known as an out-of-market call for energy, which amounts to an emergency request for electricity. From May through September this year, the overall price of power in the state averaged less than $125 per megawatt hour, according to authorities. But over the same period, power sold in response to out-of-market calls averaged more than $430. During the summer, when energy use is at a maximum, California typically imports about one-fourth of the power it uses from other states. Since power generated by firms in other states isn't limited by California's price cap, those companies generally are in a better position than California firms to make a killing on out-of-market sales. But by cutting a deal with a collaborator in another state, energy specialists say, California generators also can profit handsomely -- despite the cap. Here's how: Say a California generator has 100 megawatts. Instead of selling it in California, where the firm can receive no more than $250 per megawatt hour under the current cap, it finds a utility, an electricity broker or a corporate affiliate with an equal amount of power in another state, such as Arizona. Then -- just before an expected heat wave in California, which is likely to result in an out-of-market call for power here -- it convinces the other firm to do a trade. Under the deal, the California generator sends its 100 megawatts for one hour to the company in Arizona, where there is no price cap, and earns $300 or more per megawatt -- for a total of $300,000. In return, the Arizona firm ships its 100 megawatts for one hour here. Since that power isn't subject to California's cap, it earns perhaps $400 per megawatt -- for a total of $400,000. Presumably, energy specialists say, the two firms then split the $100,000 difference. The potential profit from such deals is considerable. Generators in and out of California received more than $110 million from out-of-market sales this summer, according to the Independent System Operator. But determining if megawatt laundering is really happening, how often and who might be benefiting, is difficult. One California investigator said authorities first suspected that megawatt laundering was occurring when they noticed that precisely the same amount of power was being sold to another state and then sold back into California minutes later. But other experts said the evidence has rarely been that clear. While hundreds of megawatts is sold into and out of the state on any given day, they said, the suspicion that firms were conspiring to sell the same power back and forth has stemmed largely from unfounded speculation. One big problem for investigators trying to learn if the system has been abused is that confidentiality rules keep many of the details about these electricity transactions private. ""Entities like us and others who may be suffering from the consequences of this laundering don't necessarily have the documents"" to prove it, said Gary Stern, director of market monitoring for Southern California Edison, one of the state's three main utilities. ""We can only speculate based on things we've heard from others about the practice....It's our hope that's one of the things that's being examined"" by the various federal and state agencies investigating this summer's extraordinary rise in California power prices. Indeed, while some people say megawatt laundering can be substantially limited by ending the practice of paying more than the wholesale cap for out-of-state power, others argue that it's just as important to eliminate the secrecy surrounding electricity transactions. ""I'd like to see more information"" made public, said Jim Bushnell, a researcher at the University of California Energy Institute in Berkeley, who specializes in analyzing the state's energy markets. ""There are a lot of rumors circulating around this,"" he said of megawatt laundering, ""and it would help clarify if this is a serious problem."" ----- To see more of the San Jose Mercury News, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.sjmercury.com",Company Business/Strategy

""It is unconscionable for the generators to prof= it=20 from their egregious overcharges. FERC must move quickly to enforce the law= =20 and order the energy companies to give back the money."" ?????Davis said the state is owed refunds of at least $6.7 billion.=20 California's grid operator has estimated that from May 2000 to May 2001,=20 power generators charged the state nearly $9 billion more than a competitiv= e=20 market would warrant, he said. ?????California, the nation's most populous state, has been hit with a seri= es=20 of rolling blackouts, the bankruptcy of its largest utility, and an economi= c=20 slowdown since the power crisis began last year. ?????The state is expected to convene a criminal grand jury to investigate= =20 whether some power generators withheld supplies, shut down plants or=20 exploited the bidding process to drive up prices. Out-of-state generators= =20 deny any illegal activity, saying the high prices simply reflect supply=20 shortages. ?????Today also marks the day that FERC's newly expanded ""price mitigation""= =20 program goes into effect in all 11 Western states with a wholesale price=20 limit of $107.9 per megawatt hour linked to a market formula. The plan had= =20 previously applied only to California during emergency power outages. ?????Since FERC's action earlier this week, Senate Democrats dropped a=20 legislative effort to strictly cap electricity prices in the West. However,= =20 California Democrats in the House were still trying to force a full vote on= a=20 package of energy amendments, including a price cap. ?????The Bush administration and many Republicans oppose price caps,=20 contending they would discourage more power production. ?????Separately, today the U.S. Energy Department issued a study that=20 supported the White House's view that strict price caps would hurt, not hel= p,=20 California. ?????The study found California faces about 113 hours of rolling blackouts= =20 this summer, a level that would double if wholesale prices were capped at= =20 $150 per megawatt because some 3,600 megawatts of generating capacity would= =20 shut down. An alternative approach of setting a price cap based on producti= on=20 costs plus $25 per megawatt would delay or close about 1,300 megawatts of= =20 capacity scheduled to be built in the state, according to the study. ?????However, lawmakers from both political parties have scrambled for some= =20 kind of solution to address the shortages in California well before the=20 congressional elections next year. ?????The FERC plan expands an existing ""price mitigation"" program in=20 California to 10 other Western states. The plan, which runs through Septemb= er=20 2002, means that during nonemergency periods the price for wholesale power= =20 cannot exceed 85 percent of the cost of electricity sold during a Stage 1= =20 power shortage emergency in California. ?????A Stage 1 emergency is declared when electricity supplies fall below 7= =20 percent of demand on the Western power grid. ?????The plan also imposes a 10 percent surcharge on all power sales into= =20 California as financial protection for generators reluctant to sell to the= =20 state's financially weak utilities. ?????Davis was due to meet the two newest FERC commissioners, Patrick Wood = of=20 Texas and Nora Brownell of Pennsylvania, today.

Four large new power plants= =20 are firing up soon, he said, and government's best and brightest are lockin= g=20 up still more megawatts to help meet our peak summer need. Californians,=20 Davis predicts, will valiantly heed his call to conserve, helping the state= =20 survive the hot months, no sweat. ?????With luck, he'll be right. Power prices have stabilized, and some ener= gy=20 analysts are wondering whether California may have tamed the blackout beast= . ?????But what if those plants don't get built in time, people don't trim=20 their electricity use 7% and energy imports are more meager than expected? ?????And what if the state gets hit by a summer that is not moderately hot,= =20 as Davis bets, but blistering, record-setting hot? ?????Government experts who ponder such questions don't expect disaster in= =20 the coming months. But they are planning for it nonetheless. ?????At best, they say, Californians can expect some gridlocked=20 intersections, an occasionally overloaded 911 system, perhaps some business= =20 bankruptcies, certainly inconvenience. At worst, the Western power grid cou= ld=20 crash, causing uncontrolled blackouts that might lead to looting,=20 contaminated water supplies, even civil unrest. ?????""How bad could this summer get?"" said state Sen.

Relentless= =20 heat grips California, the curse of a stubborn high-pressure ridge that jus= t=20 won't budge. ?????As air conditioners from Redding to Chula Vista lumber to life, manage= rs=20 of the state's power grid in Folsom gulp their third and fourth cups of=20 coffee, stare at a bank of computers and begin to fret. ?????Demand is jumping. Supply is static, Canada and Arizona have nothing t= o=20 sell. It's looking tight. ?????Thirty minutes later, the picture is gloomier. A brush fire shuts down= =20 transmission lines near Fresno, squeezing supply in the Central Valley. In= =20 the Bay Area, the unusual heat drives demand well past projections. ?????By noon things look bleak. Operators of the Diablo Canyon nuclear powe= r=20 plant near San Luis Obispo have cut output by 80%. The trouble? Chunks of= =20 kelp have lodged in one of the plant's seawater intake valves, creating a= =20 clog like one that plagued the facility in January. ?????With a chorus of groans, the grid's keepers scour the market for power= =20 to offset the Diablo loss. No luck. As the mercury climbs and the Golden=20 State economy roars into full swing, electricity consumption ticks upward,= =20 minute by minute. And when managers of a power plant near Long Beach cut=20 output because of a cracked turbine, everyone knows what it means. ?????Alert the utilities. It's lights out, California, for the fourth day i= n=20 a row. ?????Dr. J. Michael Leary dreads blackouts--not personally, but=20 professionally. Leary is an emergency room physician in the desert city of= =20 Rancho Mirage. When air conditioners go on the blink there, the=20 victims--scores of them, mostly old folks--wind up in his ER. ?????In a normal year, 75% of his emergency patients are geriatrics.

When blackouts= =20 hit, they are most at risk. ?????""It's as if you lived in Maine and they turned the heat off in January= ,""=20 Leary said. ""This is an extreme environment we live in. The effects can be= =20 devastating."" ?????Many desert seniors are on fixed incomes and live in mobile homes, som= e=20 of them poorly insulated boxes that turn into ovens under the brutal summer= =20 sun. Take away the air conditioning and the humans inside start baking, qui= ck. ?????For Leary, the specter of continual, back-to-back blackouts in=20 July--and, some predict, in June and August too--conjures images of an=20 82-year-old man, living alone in one of those mobile homes, taking medicati= on=20 for heart disease.

Leary and others at= =20 Eisenhower Medical Center will be waiting, armed with ice packs, cooled IVs= =20 and ventilators. ?????""I am very, very worried,"" the doctor said. ""I think we'll see a great= =20 toll in human suffering, even mortality."" ?????California's tomato processors are no less anxious. They wash, cook,= =20 peel, chop, mash and can about 1 million tons of tomatoes a week from July = to=20 October--enough to account for half the world's supply. For them, a string = of=20 unexpected power losses could mean economic ruin in a matter of days. ?????The reason lies in the peculiar nature of food processing--a sterile= =20 system instantly contaminated if the power fails and the plant's precise=20 temperature is disturbed. ?????Once a batch of tomatoes is tainted, it must be thrown out--all 50,000= =20 pounds. The plant must then be sanitized, a painstaking process that takes= =20 about 36 hours. ?????""If you get hit by blackouts every third day for, say, two weeks, you'= re=20 starting, stopping, cleaning, restarting--it's a nightmare,"" said Jeff Boes= e,=20 president of the California League of Food Processors.

The state's 400 dialysis centers, where patients=20 without kidney function go to have their blood cleansed every other day, ar= e=20 in the same fix. Few have backup generators, so when an outage hits,=20 technicians must crank the machines by hand. ?????Most Californians, of course, face far more ordinary consequences.

But what if such irritations become a= n=20 everyday fact of life? ?????Hundreds of ""essential"" energy users--including prisons, fire=20 departments and airports--are protected from blackouts, and hundreds more= =20 have applied for exemptions. That means the pool of people bearing the=20 blackout burden is shrinking, so more frequent outages are likely. ?????Blackout predictions vary widely, but at least one forecaster, a=20 consultant for California water districts, anticipates an outage almost eve= ry=20 afternoon of every workday this summer if temperatures are unusually warm. ?????Californians are accustomed to trash compactors, giant-screen TVs and= =20 having the Internet at their fingertips.

If that happens, Californians would be urged= =20 to boil their water until the system can be disinfected from one end of the= =20 pipe to the other. ?????Though rolling blackouts are risky, they remain essentially a controll= ed=20 phenomenon, occurring when and where the grid managers and utilities decide= .=20 Far more frightening--and devastating--are unexpected, cascading outages th= at=20 could shut down the entire Western power grid.

Gray Davis. ?????As early as next week, the order will stop the hemorrhaging of the sta= te=20 budget by allowing Treasurer Phil Angelides to borrow $5 billion to buy=20 electricity. That money is expected to cover power purchases until this fal= l,=20 when the state plans to sell an unprecedented $12.5 billion in bonds to rep= ay=20 the general tax fund and buy future electricity. ?????Angelides said Tuesday that he has already lined up $3.5 billion in=20 loans from two Wall Street firms, and expects to secure at least another=20 billion by next week, when he plans to close the deal and obtain the money. ?????The loan is critical, he said, because without it, electricity purchas= es=20 would completely deplete state coffers as early as October. ?????""In essence, it stops the general-fund bleeding,"" Angelides said. ""Wha= t=20 this interim financing does is take the pressure off the general fund and,= =20 hopefully, avert a cash crisis."" ?????The loan could also ease concerns on Wall Street that California's ris= ky=20 entry into the power business has placed the state budget in a precarious= =20 position. Those concerns were one of the main reasons two major credit rati= ng=20 agencies downgraded the state earlier this year. ?????""We have been looking forward to this day,"" said Ray Murphy, a vice=20 president at Moody's Investors Service, one of the two firms that downgrade= d=20 California's credit rating. ""We view this as a positive first step toward= =20 getting the state out of the power business. We wanted the state to get the= =20 general fund out of the business as quickly as possible."" ?????California has allocated $8.2 billion in taxpayer money for electricit= y=20 since January because the state's private utilities became too saddled with= =20 debt to continue purchasing power on the open market. and massive blackouts= =20 loomed. ?????Under a plan devised by Davis and approved by the Legislature, the sta= te=20 budget is supposed to be reimbursed for the power purchases with the bond= =20 issue, the largest in American history.

Rather, it permits Angelides to use the loan proceeds to assist t= he=20 Department of Water Resources, the state agency buying power, with its futu= re=20 electricity expenses. ?????If the bond issue is further delayed, Angelides estimated, the loan=20 would gives California another four to six months before it would begin to= =20 run out of money. Furthermore, the loan closes a potential loophole that=20 existed in the long-term contracts Davis had signed to stabilize the cost o= f=20 electricity, which would have let power suppliers walk away from the deals = if=20 the state had not secured a source of financing by next month. ?????But Republicans warned that by entering into a bridge loan deal withou= t=20 knowing when the bonds would be sold, Davis and the Democrats were incurrin= g=20 major risks that could further drive up the price tag of the crisis. ?????The loan carries a blended interest rate of about 4.5%, but if it is n= ot=20 repaid by Oct. 31, the rate jumps to 7%.

Copyright 2001 Los Angeles Times=20 State Joins Challenge to Bush on Air-Conditioner Standards=20 Regulations: U.S. rolled back Clinton rule from 30% increase in efficiency = to=20 20% on manufacturers' urging.=20 By JENIFER WARREN, Times Staff Writer=20 ?????California and two other states joined environmentalists Tuesday in=20 suing the Bush administration over its decision to weaken efficiency=20 standards for home air conditioners. ?????The lawsuit caps weeks of criticism heaped on the administration after= =20 it rolled back a rule requiring manufacturers to increase the efficiency of= =20 air conditioners 30% by 2006. ?????That rule was adopted by President Clinton during his final days in=20 office and after years of research and debate. California and other=20 states--including Texas--endorsed it as a way to substantially cut energy u= se=20 and improve air quality. ?????But after reviewing the rule at the industry's behest, Bush=20 administration officials in April sliced the mandated increase to 20%. The= =20 higher standard, they said, would have made home coolers too expensive,=20 especially for the poor. ?????Conservationists and consumer groups blasted the policy change, callin= g=20 it shortsighted at a time when California and other states are enduring an= =20 energy crunch. ?????In California, residential air-conditioning accounts for about 15% of= =20 the peak energy demand. Weakening efficiency standards, critics say, will= =20 require as many as 60 new power plants nationwide, four in California. ?????""This is a time when we need to conserve electricity and reduce our=20 dependence on the large energy generators and importers,"" state Atty. Gen.= =20 Bill Lockyer said in an interview. ""Weakening this standard is precisely th= e=20 wrong message at precisely the wrong time."" ?????In their lawsuit, Lockyer and the attorneys general of New York and=20 Connecticut allege that federal law bars the U.S. Department of Energy from= =20 softening an appliance efficiency standard. A separate but similar suit was= =20 filed by the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Consumer Federation of= =20 America and another nonprofit group. ?????Joe Davis, the Energy Department's deputy spokesman, said there would = be=20 no immediate comment on the suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan. He= =20 added, however, that ""we believe all of the actions of our decision-making = in=20 the air conditioner standards are well within the law."" ?????When Clinton's rule was issued in January, his outgoing energy=20 secretary, Bill Richardson, said the payoff in power savings and cleaner ai= r=20 would be one of the administration's greatest environmental achievements. ?????But a trade association representing air conditioner manufacturers=20 challenged the new rule, arguing that it would dramatically increase costs = of=20 the units--priced between $2,000 and $4,000--and thus discourage people fro= m=20 replacing old ones. ?????The Department of Energy sided with the industry group in April.=20 Officials said Clinton's proposal would have added $335 to the price of a n= ew=20 air conditioner, while the lower, 20% standard would boost prices only abou= t=20 $213. ?????Others, however, say those figures do not take into account the=20 economies of scale gained when manufacturers increase production of the mor= e=20 efficient units. When Congress passed the first efficiency standard for air= =20 conditioners in the late 1980s, ""industry said the sky was falling, and tha= t=20 it would increase the cost of air conditioners by $700,"" said Andrew Delask= i,=20 executive director of the nonprofit Appliance Standards Awareness Project. = In=20 fact, he said, U.S. Department of Commerce data showed no price jump. ?????Dan Reicher, the assistant secretary of Energy under Clinton who overs= aw=20 development of the stricter standards, added that high-efficiency air=20 conditioners ""are not some exotic, untested technology."" ?????""There are lots and lots of air conditioners already meeting the=20 standards--between 5% and 10% of the units sold today,"" he said. ?????Although most manufacturers support the Bush rollback, the second=20 largest maker of air conditioners--Houston-based Goodman Global Holding,=20 which produces the Amana brand--opposes it, saying any higher upfront costs= =20 would be recovered by consumers in lower utility bills. ?????On Tuesday, the company's president, John Goodman, issued a statement= =20 supporting the lawsuit, saying the tougher standard would ""give consumers a= n=20 enormous cost saving, U.S. energy consumption will drop and our environment= =20 will benefit from reduced air pollutant emissions and greenhouse gases."" ---=20 ?????Times staff writer James Gerstenzang in Washington contributed to this= =20 story. Copyright 2001 Los Angeles Times=20 New Price Caps Not a Deterrent, Power Firms Say=20 Regulation: Producers are unhappy with the federal action but say it is=20 unlikely to discourage them from constructing new plants.=20 By NANCY VOGEL and THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, Times Staff Writers=20 ?????The expanded electricity price limits approved by federal regulators= =20 could squeeze big energy traders but will probably not discourage power pla= nt=20 construction in California, electricity producers said Tuesday. ?????Power plant owners and marketers said they had not had time to digest= =20 the 53-page order and thus could not say exactly how it would affect=20 California and the 10 other Western states it covers. ?????But the companies generally asserted Tuesday that the order would not= =20 deter them from investing in the vast, power-starved Western region--though= =20 they have often raised such a prospect in arguing against price controls. ?????Whatever its long-term effects, Monday's order by the Federal Energy= =20 Regulatory Commission appeared to have an immediate effect in dampening=20 prices in California's volatile daily, or spot, market. ?????The order does not take effect until today, but the prospect of new=20 measures aimed at limiting prices appeared to tame markets Tuesday.=20 Californians used more electricity at the late-afternoon peak than on any d= ay=20 this year, yet market prices hovered around $100 a megawatt-hour. ?????That is well below the average of $284 a megawatt-hour that the state= =20 paid for electricity from January through April, with prices soaring as hig= h=20 as $1,900 at times of tight supply. ?????""All the markets in the West have come down,"" said Mike Wilczek, senio= r=20 power markets reporter for Platts, the energy market information division o= f=20 the McGraw-Hill Cos. ""It's bearish news."" ?????Nevertheless, several generators minimized the effects of the FERC=20 order, contradicting earlier warnings from some industry sources and=20 officials of the Bush administration who consider price limits to be=20 impediments to future investment in power plants. ?????""Calpine will have no problem operating under this order,"" said Joe=20 Ronan, vice president of regulatory affairs for San Jose-based Calpine Corp= .,=20 which has three power plants under construction in California and plans to= =20 build at least three others. ?????The federal order lasts only until September 2002, he said, and becaus= e=20 it sets prices based on the cost of running the most expensive, inefficient= =20 power plant in the market, it should guarantee the owners of modern plants = a=20 profit. ?????Another company planning major investments in California, Duke Energy= =20 Corp. of North Carolina, said it will not be seriously affected by the=20 federal order because it has sold the output of its four California plants= =20 well into the future. ?????""We've already forward-sold 90% of our generation for 2001 and 70% for= =20 2002,"" company spokesman Pat Mullen said. ?????Reliant Energy Inc. of Houston, which owns five power plants in=20 California, was not so sanguine about the federal order, but it has not=20 backed away from plans to install more generators. ?????""We remain committed to California, as hard as it is to do business he= re=20 today,"" spokesman Richard Wheatley said. ""We have plans that are on the=20 drawing boards for at least one, possibly two projects."" ?????On Monday, Reliant Chief Executive Joe Bob Perkins called the FERC=20 action ""more of a political response"" than an acknowledgment of the gap=20 between electricity supply and demand in California. ?????""Price caps don't work,"" Perkins said, and he warned California=20 consumers against assuming that the energy crisis is over simply because=20 wholesale electricity prices have recently dropped to their lowest levels i= n=20 a year. ?????Prices are falling because of mild weather, not price controls, he sai= d. ?????""Without sound economics that increase available supply and reduce pea= k=20 demand . . . consumers can only hope for favorable weather and look forward= =20 to [rolling blackouts],"" Perkins said. ?????Energy analyst Frederick Schultz of Raymond James & Associates in=20 Houston called the FERC order ""a nonevent to the California generators""=20 because so much of their power is now being sold through long-term contract= s. ?????However, every long-term deal reduces the size of the electricity=20 market, which supplies about 20% of California's needs. And that, in turn,= =20 limits trading opportunities for such firms as Enron Corp., which profit on= =20 the daily market's ups and downs, Schultz said. ?????Enron representatives did not respond to calls for comment. ?????The federal order imposes round-the-clock price curbs on wholesale=20 electricity sold in 11 Western states that are connected by transmission=20 grids. ?????Under the order, traders say, market prices will probably hover around= =20 $100 a megawatt-hour, depending upon the price of the natural gas that fuel= s=20 most of the state's electric generating plants. Though that is well below= =20 recent market prices, it is higher than the average of about $32 a=20 megawatt-hour that California utilities paid in 1999, before the state's=20 deregulated market spiraled out of control. ?????The FERC order dictates that the price for spot market electricity=20 across the West will be based on the cost of producing one megawatt-hour of= =20 power at the least-efficient plant selling to California grid operators. Ma= y=20 31, when a previous FERC order based on a similar formula took effect, the= =20 price set was $127 a megawatt-hour. ---=20 ?????Vogel reported from Sacramento, Mulligan from New York. Copyright 2001 Los Angeles Times=20 Wednesday, June 20, 2001=20 The FERC's Action Is Good, Bad,Ugly=20 By PETER NAVARRO ?????The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's new wholesale price caps wi= ll=20 save the Western states literally tens of billions of dollars in electricit= y=20 bills. As wonderful as that sounds, the FERC order still allows wholesale= =20 generators to extract enough windfall profits to drive the region into=20 recession.=20 ?????The FERC's approach may also perversely lead to more air pollution and= =20 natural gas shortages.=20 ?????Let's look at what the FERC did right. First, the order approved Monda= y=20 establishes price caps on a 24/7 basis rather than simply during power=20 emergencies--a long overdue reform.=20 ?????Second, the order protects the entire West, not just California. This= =20 regional cap will end ""megawatt laundering,"" whereby in-state generators so= ld=20 power across California lines and then resold it back into the state to eva= de=20 caps.=20 ?????Third, the order closes the ridiculous broker loophole that made the= =20 FERC's previous price caps Swiss cheese. Before, generators could redirect= =20 their sales from the market to energy brokers who were exempt from the pric= e=20 caps.=20 ?????So where did the FERC go wrong? The problem may be traced to the two= =20 competing methods of imposing price caps and the all-important concept of= =20 ""economic rent.""=20 ?????Economic rent, in the wholesale electricity market, is the market pric= e=20 of electricity minus the producer's cost, where cost includes not just labo= r=20 and fuel but a ""fair profit"" on the invested capital as well. In traditiona= l=20 regulation, this fair profit is calculated very simply as the market cost o= f=20 the money borrowed to build the power plant.=20 ?????Under this definition, if the producer's cost is a nickel a kilowatt= =20 hour and he can sell it for 35 cents--as producers in the West have been=20 doing--the producer can extract 30 cents of economic rent from consumers.= =20 ?????In California, the extraction of such economic rent through market=20 manipulation has taken place on a grand-theft scale. In 1999, California's= =20 electricity bill was about $7 billion. Last year, it was almost $30 billion= =20 for roughly the same amount of electricity. This year, California's bill is= =20 well on its way to $50 billion annually.=20 ?????To stop this rip-off, Gov. Gray Davis proposed ""cost-based"" price caps= .=20 Such caps are calculated on a plant-specific basis. Each generator is allow= ed=20 to recover its cost of production, including the fair profit, but not a pen= ny=20 more.=20 ?????Thus, for example, a newer, highly efficient plant generating power at= a=20 nickel per kilowatt hour would collect a nickel. The oldest, least efficien= t=20 plant that generated power for 20 cents would be allowed to collect 20 cent= s.=20 ?????By setting different prices for different plants, the economic rents a= re=20 driven to zero. Yet each generator still has a fair profit incentive to=20 produce. From a public policy perspective, it's the best of all possible=20 worlds. And it was categorically rejected by the FERC. Instead, the FERC se= ts=20 a single price for all generators based on the cost of the ""least efficient= =20 plant.""=20 ?????The obvious problem with this umbrella pricing rule is that it still= =20 allows generators to extract billions in economic rent from consumers.=20 ?????In our previous example, and under the FERC's rule, the least efficien= t=20 plant still collects 20 cents a unit to recover costs. However, the most=20 efficient plant producing power at a nickel-per-kilowatt also collects 20= =20 cents rather than a nickel and thus extracts a full 15 cents of economic=20 rent.=20 ?????Thus, under the FERC's rule, wholesale generators still will be able t= o=20 capture tens of billions of dollars more from consumers and businesses than= =20 under Davis' cost-based rule.=20 ?????The FERC's approach is still subject to the same kind of strategic=20 gaming that has been the hallmark of this crisis. Generators will ensure th= at=20 during peak times, when the price cap is being established, the most=20 expensive possible plant is in operation--whether it needs to be or not. Th= is=20 will peg the price at the highest level.=20 ?????In addition, the FERC provides generators with a perverse incentive to= =20 run their least efficient units more often. Since these least efficient=20 plants are also the highest polluting, the result will be dirtier air.=20 Moreover, the excessive running of these plants may also put a strain on=20 already stretched natural gas supplies. These least efficient plants use up= =20 to 40% more natural gas to produce a unit of electricity.=20 ?????The bottom line: The FERC ""done good."" But it could have done a lot=20 better. And the way things stand now, there still is a danger that higher= =20 electricity costs could push California and the rest of the West--and=20 eventually the nation--into a nasty recession.=20 - - - Peter Navarro Is an Associate Professor of Economics and Public Policy at U= c=20 Irvine.

Both the=20 California Power Exchange Market Monitoring Committee and the committee I= =20 chair pointed out important shortcomings in FERC's analysis of the Californ= ia=20 market and argued that its remedies would most likely harm, rather than=20 enhance, market performance.=20 At this time, FERC also did not order refunds for the unjust and unreasonab= le=20 prices, even though it acknowledged the prices reflected the exercise of=20 market power, which is the ability of a producer to force prices higher. Th= e=20 Federal Power Act requires refunds under these circumstances. But FERC said= =20 it was unable to find specific instances of firms exercising market power.= =20 This makes no sense. If FERC finds that prices indicate market power, then= =20 the generators who bid those prices are exercising market power.=20 Following the implementation of these remedies, conditions in the Californi= a=20 market deteriorated far beyond what had been predicted by the two market=20 monitoring committees. Even though January and February are the lowest dema= nd=20 months of the year, average wholesale electricity prices were almost 10 tim= es=20 higher in 2001 than they were during the same two months of 2000 and almost= =20 double the average price during the summer of 2000. In January, March and= =20 May, California experienced several days of rolling blackouts and had syste= m=20 emergencies almost every day during January and February of 2001.=20 IN April, FERC made another round of market rule changes designed to lead t= o=20 just and reasonable prices. However, in response to growing pressure from= =20 Congress, less than 10 days after these remedies were implemented, FERC=20 enacted its most recent order.=20 Before Congress declares victory, it should verify that FERC's most recent= =20 plan achieves the following two goals.=20 First, the plan should guarantee that the average price of wholesale=20 electricity paid by California over the next two years is equal to the=20 average price that would occur in a competitive electricity market, with=20 California's current supply and demand conditions and fuel costs. The Feder= al=20 Power Act requires not just a high probability of just and reasonable rates= ;=20 it requires that they occur with certainty.=20 The second goal is to alter the incentives faced by all market participants= =20 so that it will no longer be profit-maximizing for a firm to withhold=20 electricity from the market in order to drive up prices.=20 FERC's most recently implemented plan does not achieve either of these goal= s,=20 although it does come closer than any previous attempts.=20 One solution satisfying both of these goals has been proposed to FERC. In a= =20 December report to FERC, the Market Surveillance Committee of the Californi= a=20 ISO proposed a one-time regulatory intervention. This intervention would=20 require that each generator serving California sign a forward contract=20 guaranteeing that California consumers can purchase 75 percent of the=20 generator's expected output over the next two years at a specified=20 competitive benchmark price. Once a firm has signed these forward contracts= ,=20 it is free to sell all remaining energy in the western U.S. wholesale marke= t=20 at whatever price it can obtain.=20 The obligation to provide power under the contracts, and the incentive to= =20 sell 25 percent of power at unrestricted prices, would prevent generators= =20 from withholding power.=20 Unless FERC implements a solution satisfying these two goals, Congress shou= ld=20 require FERC to suspend the market-based pricing authority for all supplier= s=20 in the Western U.S. for the next two years and order all sales during this= =20 period at cost-of-service prices. This will guarantee that FERC meets the= =20 statutory mandate of the Federal Power Act in California.

Gray Davis (D) nevertheless seems heartened abou= t=20 the latest developments in the power crisis that has engulfed his state and= =20 threatened his political career.=20 On his first trip to Washington in months, Davis will detail California 's= =20 plight Wednesday in testimony to a Senate committee newly led by sympatheti= c=20 Democrats -- one important reason for his optimism.=20 But he has others: Conservation is taking hold in the state, and prices for= =20 power on the daily spot market are dropping. California has managed to avoi= d=20 rolling blackouts so far this month, in part because it has been spared a= =20 heat wave.=20 Federal regulators, under pressure even from Republican lawmakers, decided= =20 Monday to impose more controls on prices that energy suppliers can charge= =20 California . Two new power plants are scheduled to begin producing=20 electricity in weeks.

''This is a market-based mitigation plan that now will extend to 11= =20 Western states.''=20 In fact, it bore some resemblance to a proposal made by 10 leading economis= ts=20 who urged a middle ground between fixed prices and a deregulated electricit= y=20 market. Mr. Davis used their proposal to support his position in favor of= =20 limited price restraints when Mr. Bush visited California .=20 The White House shift from outright opposition to price controls to its mor= e=20 nuanced position today exemplifies how Mr. Bush has tempered his embrace of= =20 completely unfettered markets in recent weeks. He didn't have much choice.= =20 As the threat of blackouts loomed, demands for action rose from officials o= f=20 both parties and from consumers in the West. It was almost possible to hear= =20 sighs of relief at the White House today that the Federal Energy Regulatory= =20 Commission -- an independent body in the Energy Department -- had moved to= =20 turn down the political heat.=20 In fact, while some House Democrats are still pressing for firmer caps on= =20 prices, Senators Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California , and Gordon H.= =20 Smith, Republican of Oregon, withdrew a bill that would have placed strict= =20 price controls on electricity sold in Western markets.=20 Senator Feinstein said the White House could call yesterday's regulatory=20 action ''mitigation'' or anything else it pleased.=20 ''A rose is a rose by any other name,'' she said today.=20 And a free market is not always free. Two weeks ago the administration said= =20 it would rescue steel companies and steelworkers who have long complained= =20 about unfair competition from South Korea, Taiwan, China, Brazil, Germany,= =20 Russia and Ukraine. The White House defended the action by saying it was th= e=20 only way for the industry to adjust to a new competitive environment.=20 Last month, with no major announcements at the White House, the Bush=20 administration voted for International Monetary Fund aid to two countries,= =20 Turkey and Argentina, that (like California ) had made some economically=20 disastrous political decisions.=20 In each case, Mr. Bush's economic orthodoxies were tempered by political=20 realities.=20 The California crisis was one thing when it involved a Democratic governor = in=20 a state Mr. Bush lost by a million votes; it was another, one of his aides= =20 conceded today, when congressional Republicans from around the West were=20 warning Mr. Bush that blackouts and sky-high prices could blow up in his=20 first year in office.=20 ''We heard from a lot of members of Congress who feared that Republicans=20 would be tarred with worsening the problem, even though it happened on Gray= =20 Davis's watch,'' the political aide said. ''The president took that on=20 board.''=20 Similarly, the steel decision was partly about enforcing laws against=20 ''dumping'' foreign products in the market -- and partly about Mr. Bush's= =20 desire to convince labor unions not to block his trade agenda. Like=20 Californians coping with higher energy prices, the steelworkers need time t= o=20 adjust to a new world, the administration said.=20 ''Open markets improve the lives of people by increasing opportunity, choic= e=20 and economic freedom,'' Robert B. Zoellick, Mr. Bush's trade representative= ,=20 said in an interview today. ''But compassionate conservatism also recognize= s=20 the reality that the effects of rapid change fall harder on some communitie= s=20 and industries,'' which, he said, need ''vital breathing space to adapt to= =20 change.''=20 While Mr. Bush expressed deep reservations about I.M.F. bailouts during the= =20 presidential campaign, the situation seemed a bit more complicated once he= =20 got to Washington. The State and Defense Departments feared that if Turkey= =20 were engulfed in economic chaos, and blamed the United States for failing t= o=20 come to its aid, its leaders might be less inclined to let American fighter= =20 jets use its territory to mount missions over Iraq.=20 So given the choice between letting the Turkish people pay a high price for= =20 political mistakes -- Californians take note -- and weakening American=20 pressure on Saddam Hussein, Mr. Bush decided that economic niceties were le= ss=20 important than political consistency. Mr. Bush chose the Pentagon over the= =20 Treasury.=20 Administration officials said these actions did not represent a retreat fro= m=20 let-the-markets-prevail orthodoxy.=20 Lawrence B.

On the question of retroactive ratemaking, it is my understanding that you are correct. PG&E probably won't rebill, but will need to put in place an adjustment to the going forward PX Credit to ""collect"" the overpayment of Negative CTC. All of this means that the impact of the FERC refund is less than 100c on the $ for the Negative CTC.

It is not clear to me which variable represents hourly ISO imbalance energy costs, but I assume its ""Est RT$"". If I am right, that variable would be affected by the mitigated market price (MMP) for CAISO imbalance energy. My comments are: The FERC is able to only order refunds to jurisdictional entities and, given appeals, it may take years before the full extent of thre refunds are known. Therefore there will be a significant difference between the change in the mitigated market price (MMP) as declared by FERC and the PX credit. That is, a 10% reduction in the MMP should not be construed as having a 10% effect on the PX credit, assuming it can be recalculated at all. Specifically, only some of the ""HC"" or ""Est RT$"" costs can be adjusted per FERC refund orders. Also, the PX credit is a tariffed rate. I do not believe the PU code allows for retroactive adjustments to tariffed rates unless there was an explicit cost tracking account (e.g. a balancing A/C). To my knowledge, no such account exists here. Finally, I do not see a relationship between MMPs and (1) block forward costs on any date and (2) PG&E and/or DWR's procurement costs for the net short position post January 19. So, those PX credit costs should be unaffected by any FERC refund order. Alan Comnes -----Original Message----- From: Steffes, James D.

What's worse, Lockyer has indicated tha= t=20 he believes that rape is an appropriate part of the system of punishments h= e=20 administers.=20 ?????Should it matter that Lay is a businessman? Imagine the outcry if the= =20 head of Enron were female. What would Lockyer's fellow Democrats have said = to=20 that?=20 ?????Should it matter that Lay is chairman of an electricity generator? Doe= s=20 the nature of his business justify threats to escort him to his own rape?= =20 Lockyer told the Los Angeles Times that he had singled out Enron's chairman= =20 because the Houston-based company is the world's largest energy trader.=20 ?????So apparently singling out a man for a heinous threat is OK because he= 's=20 the chairman of the world's largest energy trading company.

By Thomas Buckley The Press-Enterprise LAKE ELSINORE A new group has raised its objections to Lake Elsinore's proposed hydroelectric plant and the power lines that might carry its electricity to San Diego County. On Thursday, the Elsinore Valley Municipal Water District board set aside for further study later this month a motion by Director Gary Kelley to ensure that both the lines and the actual power plant that make up a $450 million proposal from Enron North America proceed together. But residents of La Cresta, a mountaintop community near where the lines might run, did not care whether the plant and lines happened together. Many of them do not want the lines to be there at all. ""We are resolved to keep power lines out of the Cleveland National Forest and the San Mateo Wilderness Area,"" said La Cresta resident Bill Stockmar. ""Our constituents and the local residents impacted by the proposed project are outraged and respectfully demand immediate intervention to stop this project at the planning level."" As it stands now, the power lines from the hydroelectric plant would run from Temescal Canyon to Camp Pendleton along the ridge line of the Elsinore Mountains just west of the lake. Those lines could run in a narrow strip of forest land just west of the La Cresta community. Enron project manager Rob Bakondy said the final determination of where the lines might run is not set, but he said the power lines could be built at least a year before the plant itself. Besides serving the hydroelectric plant, the power lines could be used to replace lines San Diego Gas and Electric wants to build through Murrieta and Temecula to bring power to San Diego. The water district also announced it is considering financing and building the lines itself. District General Manager John Rossi said Wednesday that it was too early to say exactly how the lines would be built, but that the district's building or owning the lines, or both, in cooperation with Enron is ""one possibility."" Board President Kris Anderson said it is too early to tell whether it would benefit the district to become so directly involved in the project. But he said the district would be able to borrow the approximately $50 million needed to build the lines at a lower interest rate than a private company could get. That difference, Anderson said, could mean extra dollars for the district. How Governor Davis' proposal to purchase thousands of miles of transmission lines from the ailing utilities will affect the project is not yet clear, said Enron spokeswoman Kathy Russeth. The timing of the construction of the project, if it is approved by state and federal regulators, will not be finally known until a contract between Enron and the water district has been agreed upon. That is expected to happen by the end of May. GOP in a fix over power crisis Leaders seek solutions that won't undercut past support for deregulation By Daniel Borenstein TIMES POLITICAL EDITOR California Republican Party leaders are trying desperately to politicize the state's electricity crisis by blaming Gray Davis, but it seems that the harder they try the more popular the Democratic governor becomes. The latest GOP push will come today when party leaders, meeting in Sacramento for the start of their three-day state convention, hold a hastily organized workshop on energy. ""We should be explaining to California that Gray Davis was asleep at the switch last year,"" said one of the scheduled speakers, Republican strategist Dan Schnur. ""But that message can only work if it's coupled with a proposal for an alternative solution."" So far, that hasn't happened. For all the complaints about Davis, Republicans are moving even slower. Looking to 2002, when Davis will stand for re-election, the GOP has run radio ads attacking the governor for delays. But the party has yet to distinguish itself with a solid plan of its own. ""If Republicans are able in the next couple of months to articulate a clear plan, which is different from the Democratic plan, yes, we can use it as a political message,"" said Stuart DeVeaux, spokesman for the California Republican Party. ""Are Republicans in Sacramento going to come up with a plan that articulates a future for our energy problem? I'm not telling you it's going to be revealed this weekend. It's my hope it will be articulated this weekend."" Republicans are caught in an ideological quagmire. Pushing for re-regulation of electricity conflicts with the party's basic tenet of less government interference. Conversely, arguing for full deregulation puts Republicans at odds with a solid majority of Californians. A Los Angeles Times poll taken Feb. 14-15 found that 60 percent of Californians want to go back to a regulated electricity industry, while 25 percent are opposed. The GOP problem is exacerbated because there is no easy policy solution to the energy mess, said Jack Pitney, government professor at Claremont McKenna College. ""It's difficult to see how we get out of this situation without considerable cost. If there were a silver bullet, somebody would have found it by now."" Republicans have attacked Davis for his plan to buy power lines from private utilities. ""Everybody agrees there's $1 billion or $2 billion in deferred maintenance,"" said GOP consultant Sal Russo, another speaker at the party's convention today. ""We need to be in this business like a hole in the head."" But the Times poll found that Californians, by a 52-36 margin, favor the idea. Moreover, Davis' job approval rating has climbed this year. In January, 49 percent approved and 25 percent disapproved. In February, it was up to 57-26. Californians give Davis better marks for handling the electricity crisis than they give President Bush. Republicans are going to have difficult time laying the political blame on Davis. ""It's 'Murder on the Orient Express.' Everybody did it,"" Pitney said. ""Although you can make a case that Davis was slow in reacting, no one can seriously pin him with the primary blame for the problem."" The deregulation bill passed the Legislature in 1996 with the strong support of both parties and a Republican governor, Pete Wilson. Senate Minority Leader Jim Brulte, R-Rancho Cucamonga, is considered one of the Republican Party's top strategists. He was also one of the leading proponents of the deregulation bill. For all of those reasons, Garry South, Davis' political strategist, said he does not fear a GOP attack on electricity. ""If the Republicans want to get into a full-out firefight over how this mess came about, I'm more than willing to play. They don't have a very good story to tell."" For now, Davis' political strength is stable. But the 2002 primary elections are still more than a year away, and the general election is a political eternity from now. ""If this isn't resolved, there is nothing to guarantee that there won't be a voter backlash against the government,"" said political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe. ""And right now the government in California is the Democratic Party."" That's the message the Republicans want to drive home. But if they can't come up with their own alternative, they might have a hard time playing the blame game. Davis says state has tentative deal for Edison grid Updated: Feb. 23, 2001 - 4:42 p.m. LOS ANGELES -- After a week of intense closed-door negotiations with utility representatives, Gov. Gray Davis said Friday he had reached an ""agreement in principle"" with Southern California Edison to buy the utility's power lines for an estimated $2.7 billion. The deal also requires Edison International, the parent company of Edison, to sell cheap power to the state for a decade. ""This is the framework of a good, balanced deal,"" Davis said. ""It's not a final deal. There's a lot of work to be done, But we're making progress."" The governor said he did not expect customer rates to increase as a result of the deal. Edison did not immediately return calls seeking comment. The state has been in talks for a week to buy a total of 26,000 miles of transmission lines from Edison, Pacific Gas and Electric and Sempra Energy, which operates San Diego Gas & Electric. The total cost of the lines could range from $4.5 billion to $7 billion. The effort is intended to help restore the financial health of the state's two largest utilities, PG&E and Edison, both of which are near bankruptcy. The $2.7 billion price for the Edison lines amounts to 2.3 times the estimated book value, Davis said. The utilities say they have lost nearly $13 billion since June, trapped between soaring wholesale power prices and state-imposed rate caps for consumers. The tentative plan announced by Davis would allow Edison to issue bonds for a substantial portion of its losses. Davis said the state is making good progress in its talks with Sempra and ""some progress"" with PG&E. Thursday, Davis said he will not sign off on any grid buyout without all three utilities' participation. ""I do not believe we can make a satisfactory arrangement without 60 percent of the transmission grid, and that would require cooperation with PG&E,"" he said Friday. PG&E spokesman Ron Low said Thursday night that talks had ended with no resolution that day. ""These are complicated problems that will not be solved overnight,"" Low said. ""There are clearly some issues where we are very far apart."" Still, PG&E chief executive officer Robert Glynn Jr. said Friday the meeting with Davis was a ""milestone in the resolution of California's energy crisis"" and said he was willing to meet further to discuss the utility's proposal. ""Each utility's issues and opportunities in this crisis are different, and we believe that PG&E has proposed a detailed solution that balances ratepayer and shareholder interests,"" Glynn said in a statement issued Friday before the governor's news conference. The company said it would have no further comment. The tentative agreement also calls for: Edison parent Edison International to make payments to the utility of about $420 million. Edison International to commit the entire output of its Sunrise Mission power project at low, cost-based rates for 10 years. Davis said that arrangement could save ratepayers $500 million over the next two years. Edison to provide cost-based rates from generating plants it owns for another 10 years. Edison to drop its lawsuit against the California Public Utilities Commission claiming that imposed rate caps were illegal under federal law. ""This entire transaction, which I believe is fair and balanced for both sides, will be accomplished within the existing rate structure,"" Davis said. ""We will not be asking any more of consumers to allow this transaction to come to pass."" Davis said negotiations will continue in the coming days. Consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield called the governor's plan ""an outrageous giveaway"" and predicted that if lawmakers didn't halt it, voters would revolt. ""The most outrageous part of this isn't even paying 2.3 times what the lines are worth, but then allowing the parent companies that siphoned off billions of dollars to pay only the tax payment they already owe,"" Rosenfield said. The Public Utilities Commission already regulates how much the utilities can charge for power their own plants generate, Rosenfield said. --By Leslie Gornstein, Associated Press Writer - Utilities Search for Long-Term Fix During Breather State purchase of power lines under discussion Friday,?February 23, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle Sacramento -- A break in the weather and a break in the energy crisis coincided yesterday, as California enjoyed its first day in more than a month without a power alert. With the short-term picture for power improving, representatives of the state's three troubled utilities met separately with Gov. Gray Davis and his staff to work on a longer-range fix for the power crisis that would include state purchase of the firms' transmission lines. Trouble loomed in at least one set of talks, however, as Pacific Gas and Electric Co. said it was ""very far"" from reaching a deal. The California Independent System Operator, which coordinates the flow of electricity through the state's power grid, removed all power alerts at about 9 a.m. yesterday. Spokeswoman Lorie O'Donley said that with springtime approaching and weather improving, and with some power plants coming back to full output from maintenance, the overall picture is brightening. ""We're optimistic,"" she said. ""We're coming into the spring season, the majority of generators have had their maintenance completed. But everything is dependent on the weather and temperature."" The last day California had no power alerts was Jan. 13. Since then, there have been two days of rolling blackouts in Northern California and many other days of Stage 3 alerts -- when power reserves dip below 1.5 percent of available capacity. The mildest alert, Stage 1, is declared when reserves are between 5 and 7 percent of capacity. The supply of power has been helped by warmer temperatures in other Western states, cutting demand there, and by an increase in generators on line in California, O'Donley said. Last week, when the state was still in Stage 3 alerts, 10,500 megawatts were offline in California. Yesterday, there were 8,200 megawatts offline, a difference that provides enough power for a couple million homes. O'Donley warned that the supply picture in California is still tight, and conservation still necessary. But the focus of attention was turning to Sacramento and Davis' talks with the utilities. Davis announced a plan last week for the state to purchase 26,000 miles of utility-owned transmission lines in exchange for backing bonds that allow the utilities to repay the almost $13 billion in debt they say they owe. While Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric have indicated willingness to sell their lines, PG&E has refused to comment on the proposal. It is not clear if PG&E is unwilling to sell or simply trying to strike a harder bargain. The utility had accumulated more debt than its Southern California counterparts, and also owns the largest part of the transmission line grid. Talks between Davis' staff and PG&E did not start until late yesterday afternoon, and indications were that they were more difficult than negotiations involving the other two utilities. ""They're just on a different page,"" Michael Peevey, the former Edison president who is Davis' chief negotiator, told Bloomberg News. PG&E spokesman Ron Low said, ""These are difficult problems that cannot be solved overnight. There are clearly some areas where we are very far apart."" Davis hopes to make an announcement with at least one of the utilities before leaving today for the four-day National Governors Association meeting in Washington, D.C. The union that represents some 11,000 PG&E employees, meanwhile, called on Davis to negotiate state ownership of two power plants under construction in which PG&E holds large stakes. Jack McNally, business manager of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 1245, in Walnut Creek told Davis in a letter that a transmission line takeover would be a ""grand experiment"" fraught with danger. Acquiring the two prospective power plants, in Kern and San Diego counties, would do more to address energy shortages than taking over transmission lines that need hundreds of millions of dollars in maintenance, union officials said. Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio countered that state acquisition of transmission lines ""would not affect one union job,"" as the state would simply lease the grid back to the utilities. Maviglio predicted union jobs would increase with investment in new capacity and system upgrades. Chronicle staff writers Patrick Hoge and Robert Salladay contributed to this report. State's energy price tag increases Published Friday, Feb. 23, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News BY DION NISSENBAUM Mercury News Sacramento Bureau SACRAMENTO -- California's energy crisis took another big bite out of the state budget Thursday when finance aides to Gov. Gray Davis announced that the cost of buying energy may top $3 billion by mid-March. In a move that raised new alarms for lawmakers, the governor's finance team for the third time this month asked for $500 million to buy electricity in the coming weeks while Davis tries to work out a deal to bail out the state's near-bankrupt utilities. That, combined with money spent last month to buy energy, could drain the state coffers of $3 billion by St. Patrick's Day. The request for more cash came on the same day that California spent its first day in weeks without an official energy emergency and Davis held critical talks with the heads of Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. The talks are aimed at rescuing the two companies and Southern California Edison from financial collapse. While Davis had expressed hope last week of working out a deal by today, sources said that an agreement still remains elusive. Until a compromise can be hammered out, the state is being forced to pay upward of $50 million a day from the general fund to buy electricity. State leaders expect that the money will eventually be repaid to the general fund under a $10 billion bond package. But lawmakers are growing increasingly concerned about the short-term impact on the state fiscal plan. Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San Francisco, said the latest request for more money could create ``greater concern and anxiety'' among lawmakers and added that the energy crisis was going to make it harder to fund other programs, such as support for abused children. ``It's going to be a bleak year for other budget priorities,'' said Migden, who is chairwoman of the powerful Assembly Appropriations Committee. Earlier this week, the state's independent financial analyst warned that the energy crisis could eat into state money the governor wants to spend on other things such as the environment and public safety. While lawmakers have so far bitten their tongues about the growing power price tag, Migden said the Legislature might be hesitant to allow the costs to go any higher. ``I can't imagine another infusion after this being required,'' Migden said. ``I think this has to be the last request because we're going to hit fundamental core programs.'' Waiting for bailout plan California stepped in to buy the energy last month after PG&E and Southern California Edison lost the financial wherewithal to do it themselves. At the time, state leaders reluctantly agreed to buy the energy for a short period of time as part of a larger plan for California to sign long-term contracts with power generators. But those negotiations have failed to produce much energy so far, and Davis said earlier this week that the power producers are hesitant to sign any deals until California agrees to a bailout plan for the utilities. On Thursday, one power producer -- Williams Cos. -- announced that it had signed a 10-year contract with the state to provide up to 1,400 megawatts of power to California. In a bid to work out the bailout plan, Davis and his advisers met Thursday and were to meet again today with top executives from all three electric utilities in financial trouble. The Democratic governor wants to buy 26,000 miles of high voltage transmission lines owned by the three companies in exchange for helping the utilities pay off $13 billion in debts. The utilities are being asked to protect thousands of acres of wilderness lands they own, hang onto power plants that provide the state with its cheapest electricity, and drop explosive lawsuits that could allow the companies to dramatically raise customer rates. But sources said talks have bogged down on the transmission line deal, which PG&E has been reluctant to accept. Alternative energy helps out While talks slogged along in the governor's office, state lawmakers announced that another key piece of the puzzle needed to solve the energy crisis was falling into place. State Sen. Jim Battin, R-Palm Desert, and Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Santa Cruz, said that alternative energy producers had agreed to dramatically lower their prices in a deal that could save California $3 billion to $4 billion. Those energy producers, nearly 700 wind, solar and natural gas-fired plants, provide about a third of the state's energy. Paying for power still a big question POWER CRISIS PG&E doesn't like the plan the PUC proposed to collect electricity costs By Mike Taugher TIMES STAFF WRITER Three weeks after Gov. Gray Davis signed into law the state's centerpiece for stabilizing energy costs, big differences remain over how the solutions will be implemented and who will pay for them. The plan, outlined in legislation known as AB1X, was intended first to stop the financial bleeding of California's two largest utilities by asking the state to buy enough unsecured power to keep the lights on. Next, the state would enter long-term contracts for less expensive power that would eventually lessen the need for more costly, last-minute electricity. But the state has balked at buying the entire portfolio of last-minute electricity that is needed, and a disagreement emerged Thursday over what portion of consumers' bills should be used to reimburse state coffers. Meanwhile, progress on completing contracts has been slow, although two were signed Thursday. A spokesman for Davis said more contracts for relatively low-cost power would be signed once the state bought the utilities' transmission lines and other assets, because then the utilities could pay their past-due bills. The governor said last week that he expected a deal with the utilities by today, but that might not happen. ""Clearly, there's been challenges getting long-term contracts, but we've turned the corner,"" said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio. ""We've got three in the bank and 10 more once we get these deals (with the utilities) done."" Also Thursday, the Public Utilities Commission was poised to allow the state to collect the entire amount that customers pay specifically for electricity. But Pacific Gas & Electric Co. said it is entitled to deduct other costs from customers' payments before reimbursing the state. That would reduce payments from PG&E to the state by about half, according to the company. The PUC proposal was in response to a request from the state Department of Water Resources that it be allowed to start collecting money so that energy companies would be more willing to sell power to the agency. The two Republican-appointed commissioners of the PUC blocked the move, which needed four of five commissioners' approval to reach the agenda. ""DWR's (action) is exacerbating a problem AB1X was meant to alleviate,"" said Commissioner Richard Bilas. ""It is pushing the utilities closer to bankruptcy."" PG&E spokesman John Nelson said the proposal brought by PUC President Loretta Lynch would have been unfair to the utilities because AB1X allows them to deduct expenses for buying electricity and generating energy at their own power plants before reimbursing the state. ""All of those costs need to be paid going forward. Otherwise, you still leave the utilities to bleed,"" Nelson said. That stance appeared to be at odds with the office of Assemblyman Fred Keeley, the Boulder Creek Democrat who wrote AB1X. ""For PG&E to think it can keep money for electrons it never even owned is astounding to us,"" said Guy Phillips, a Keeley aide. While nothing has gone smoothly, Phillips and others expressed optimism that the state's biggest effort to date to fix the energy crisis would work. ""We think those will be sorted out,"" said Phillips, who acknowledged there has been much confusion about what lawmakers intended in AB1X. For example, Keeley's office said lawmakers wanted the water resources agency to make up the entire amount of electricity that the state's two largest utilities had not secured ahead of time. The high cost of this last-minute electricity -- and the utilities' heavy reliance on it -- is what drove PG&E and Southern California Edison to the brink of bankruptcy. But the water agency has balked at buying electricity offered at prices it calls ""unreasonable."" While state officials have refused to say how much electricity it has left to utilities to purchase, the state is paying about $55 million a day to keep electricity flowing. And that amounts to about 90 percent of the electricity purchased on behalf of the utilities on the same day it is needed, according to Phillips. The state's reluctance to buy all of the so-called real-time electricity has led to fears that the utilities will continue to run up debt and that power companies will not collect money owed to them. That dispute has landed in federal court, where a Sacramento judge is forcing three major power suppliers and a marketing company to continue selling power in the state. If a settlement is not reached today, U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell is expected to decide whether to extend his order, to modify it or to drop it. Staff writer Andrew LaMar contributed to this story. Lowenthal returns utility money By Will Shuck From our Sacramento Bureau SACRAMENTO Assemblyman Alan Lowenthal, D-Long Beach, this week joined a small group of legislators who returned campaign contributions to California utility companies and other energy firms. He sent $5,000 back to Southern California Edison and $500 to Sempra Energy, parent company of Southern California Gas. It was a small portion of the more than Lowenthal $500,000 Lowenthal had raised in 2000 for his re-election campaign. He said he returned the money, as did nine other Assembly members, at the urging of the consumer advocacy group Global Exchange. ""We think it's fantastic that he has recognized that in the eyes of the public there is a very serious potential conflict of interest,"" said group spokeswoman Medea Benjamin. ""We applaud him for wanting to ensure the integrity of the legislative process."" While Benjamin says it's critical that lawmakers not be tainted by energy money during the state's power crisis, others wonder where the line should be drawn. ""In the real world of politics it costs money to run for office and you have to get that money somewhere,"" said Paul Schmidt, a political science professor at Cal State Long Beach. ""To say that you can only make decisions on things involving individuals that haven't given you any money would result in paralysis of government."" Benjamin and other consumer advocates say the power crisis calls for special consideration. ""There are not many cases in which they're actually voting whether a company will survive with billions of dollars of taxpayer money or go bankrupt, as they're doing with the utility companies,"" Benjamin said. Lowenthal agreed. ""I thought it was an appropriate request,"" he said. ""These are unique circumstances, and I just think it's in the public's best interest that I return that money."" Dan Walters: A power grab by politicians (Published Feb. 23, 2001) Slowly, but inexorably, control over the generation, acquisition and distribution of electric power in California is being shifted from professional utility managers and independent regulators into the hands of politicians. The 1996 utility ""deregulation"" scheme enacted by the Legislature was an initial foray into politicization. Legislation granting the governor more control over the makeup of the Public Utilities Commission was another. But the current power supply/price crisis has led to even more direct political influence over -- or interference with -- electric service. One hastily enacted bill, for example, gives the governor direct control of the now-misnamed ""Independent System Operator,"" which operates the statewide power grid. More political intrusion is in the works, from a state takeover of the intercity power transmission grid to the creation of a state power authority that would buy, generate and sell electricity directly. And while local public utilities function well, a state power agency might operate on the whims of professional politicians. The Legislature, for example, wants appointments to the board that would direct a state power authority, and big state power projects would be subject to the same kind of pork-barrel mentality that distorts other public works appropriations. Where power plants were to be built, or where high-voltage lines would be strung, might well depend on who could, and could not, bring political influence to bear, rather than what the system needed to work efficiently. Clues to the potential pitfalls of a state-operated power system are found in the approaches of Capitol politicians to the current crisis. There is, for example, the unspoken goal of avoiding big power rate boosts until after the November 2002 election -- even if it means running up billions of dollars in debts to do it. Would future rates charged by a state power authority be raised or lowered to enhance the prospects of the dominant party or an incumbent governor? There's no evidence in past performances to indicate they wouldn't be. And then there's the knotty question of who would get vital power supplies in the event of shortages -- a situation that is already looming and could become worse in future months. Emergency legislation already gives the state the right to sell power as it pleases, without competitive bidding or even public notice. There's nothing, really, to prevent politically influential power customers such as big industrial enterprises from cutting their own supply deals with politically directed state officials. And whose juice would be cut off if shortages mean blackouts? Approximately 45 percent of current power customers are effectively exempt from rolling blackouts because they are connected to circuits (called ""blocks"") that also include vital services, such as hospitals, fire and police agencies, water supply systems and communications centers. The Capitol, not surprisingly, is in one of those noninterruptible blocks. With the threat of further blackouts looming, legislation is being drafted to designate which customers will suffer and which will not -- thus taking that authority out of the hands of utilities and regulators. And that, in turn, is generating pressure from lobbyists from all sorts of interest groups to place their clients on protected lists. Should farmers be cut off, or biotechnology facilities, or computer chip plants, or schools? When politicians control any process or system, one can be certain that they will always make expedient political decisions, regardless of the long-term or wider consequences. Thus, we may someday regret allowing the Capitol's self-serving politicians to get their hands on our electric power system. Discount Urged Near Power Plants Senator urges electricity rate break for neighbors of generators Friday,?February 23, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle As California officials propose building 32 new ""peaker"" power plants across the state by July, one legislator from plant-rich eastern Contra Costa County thinks residents should get a discount on their power bill for having a generator in their backyard. The proposed bill would provide a little payback for residents of state Sen. Tom Torlakson's district, which is home to a half-dozen plants and has three more in the construction pipeline. Under the bill introduced yesterday by Torlakson, D-Antioch, people living within a 20-mile circle around a power plant would receive a 20 percent discount on their electricity bill and be exempt from blackouts. The legislation was partially inspired by San Jose officials' rejecting a proposal to build a 600-megawatt power plant in the Coyote Valley, as well as Gov. Gray Davis' plan to build 5,000 megawatts of new generating capacity by July 1. ""It's a question of fairness,"" Torlakson said. ""People in communities who are shouldering the burden for having plants in their backyard should get some benefit from it."" Torlakson said consumers who lived in communities without plants could pick up the tab for the discounts. ""But the utilities would have to figure that out within their rate system,"" he said. A PG&E spokesman said yesterday that the company does not comment on pending legislation. While consumer advocates, environmentalists and power generators were lukewarm to the proposal yesterday, many admit that the state has not thought about how to -- of even if they have to -- offer communities a little incentive to approve a power plant within their borders. However, the state has allocated $30 million for plants that get online by July 1. ""As far as incentives, I'd think most communities would see the value of the employment they'd get and the increase to the tax base,"" said Larry Hamlin, the governor's recently appointed project manager for the plant-building campaign. A spokesman for California's Environmental Protection Agency, which permits plants, said the plan might be a ""worthwhile idea for making power plants more palatable to Californians."" Michael Shames, head of Utility Consumer Action Network in San Diego said the bill was attacking a ""not in my back yard"" problem that doesn't exist. ""Many San Diego communities are clamoring for plants in the hope that they would bring stability to the market,"" he said. James Peters of Mirent, the Atlanta-based company formerly known as Southern Energy, said the plan wouldn't encourage generators to build the number of plants needed to solve the energy crisis. Already, communities like Pittsburg have cut deals with power generators before letting them build. In exchange for letting the Calpine Corp. build two large plants in town, Pittsburg received the lifetime option to purchase 100 megawatts of power at below-market rates. Next week, a Pittsburg group is going to begin gathering signatures demanding that city leaders use the estimated 26 megawatts it would take to light residences and businesses to give local residents a break on bills. The group will hold an organizational meeting at 7 p.m. Tuesday at the Los Medanos Community Hospital, 2311 Loveridge Rd. in Pittsburg. At last, power alerts are lifted: Enjoy respite because crisis far from resolved, experts say By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer (Published Feb. 23, 2001) As oddly as it arrived, California's electric emergency lifted Thursday morning. At 9 a.m., the Independent System Operator, which controls most of California's grid, ended a Stage 1 alert. It was the first time since Jan. 13 that the state hadn't been under a power emergency, declared when low supplies threaten grid stability. The alerts included 32 straight days of Stage 3 emergencies, the black clouds that gather before rotating outages. The clouds cleared on a day when predicted peak use was low -- but not the lowest it has been for the last five weeks. Many power plants were back on line after repairs -- but more plants had been operating during at least one Stage 3 day. So what happened? A little luck, a little planning and maybe a little group psychology, said those who have closely watched recent gyrations of the state's electric roller coaster. ""It is a roll of the dice,"" said Gary Ackerman, head of the Western Power Trading Forum, which represents plant owners and marketers. ""If it continues for the next three or four weeks I wouldn't be too surprised. That'll be our respite. Enjoy it."" The end of a 40-day string of emergencies could mean a few more lights in store aisles or a little less worry about running an electric furnace. Some speculated it might also mean lower wholesale prices. But major changes are not likely in the steady rain of conservation calls that have fallen on Californians since the north state was twice plunged into rotating blackouts last month. ""I hope people don't just go back to wasteful ways,"" said Mike Florio of The Utility Reform Network, a consumer group. Now that the emergencies have dissipated, ""we don't have to talk about imposing hardships on people, but prudent use of energy is an idea we're going to have to live with for a long time,"" he said. At the ISO, longer days and slightly warmer weather was credited with decreasing peak demand for electricity. Supplies are up within the state, and power imports from the Pacific Northwest have risen significantly, said Jim Detmers, who manages grid operations. Plus, in one of the biggest changes, the state Department of Water Resources has begun getting more power supplies lined up at least a day in advance, he said. Since the department stepped in to buy power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities, it has often managed to line up about 70 percent to 75 percent of what the state needed to supplement utility-controlled supplies, according to Detmers. That meant grid operators had to scramble to buy the rest on very short notice. But starting last Friday, the state began to schedule about 90 percent of its purchases at least one day in advance. ""The operators are able to enter a day with a lot more confidence about being able to make it,"" Detmers said. ""You don't have to search to find those megawatts at the last minute."" Closely in sync with increased purchases by the state, the ISO dropped from a Stage 3 emergency to Stage 2 on Friday, and then slid to a Stage 1 Wednesday. The stages are based on how much reserve power is left for unexpected crises; a Stage 3 is declared when reserves slip below 1.5 percent. For their part, power buyers at the water resources department weren't sure what has made the difference over the past few days. ""It's certainly not that people are lining up to sell us power at cheap prices,"" said Jim Spence, the department's director of emergency operations. ""We're just buying whatever we can, and it turned out that it was easier to make ends meet."" He said he couldn't make any prediction about how long that would last. The string of power emergencies has been unpredictable from the start, erupting in winter, when California's hunger for electricity traditionally declines and supplies are usually so flush that plants close for tune-ups. Consumer advocates and power traders blamed finances for the emergencies, rather than a fundamental lack of supply, as fears of utility bankruptcies triggered a descent into market chaos and high-stakes political maneuvering. But basic supply shortages are expected to move to the forefront by summer, when temperatures rise and demand soars. Meanwhile, the brief respite -- whatever the reason -- brought palpable relief to those charged with keeping the power grid stable. ""When we found out yesterday during the board meeting that we were only in Stage 1, we broke out in applause,"" said Florio, who sits on the five-member ISO board. The change also could be good news for consumers, who may one day be paying higher rates for the wholesale electricity now being purchased by the state. ""Getting out of a Stage 3 typically means prices are going to ease,"" Florio said. ""When you're even in a Stage 1, that's a signal to everybody, 'They're short, that means we can hold them up now.' "" Davis' deadlines on energy much easier set than met By Emily Bazar Bee Staff Writer (Published Feb. 23, 2001) Exactly one week ago, Gov. Gray Davis sounded hopeful, optimistic even, when he predicted that the state and its debt-ridden utilities would forge an agreement by today on a plan to save the companies from financial doom. Problem is, it won't work out that way. Negotiations between state officials and the investor-owned utilities have produced no comprehensive agreement to announce today. Davis' predictions during the energy crisis have been wrong before. For weeks, he has set deadlines for agreements and legislative action that haven't been met. On deadline days, even when there's little substantive progress to report, Davis often holds news conferences anyway -- many of them on Friday afternoons after financial markets close. The Democratic governor's office scheduled an ""announcement"" for today in Los Angeles, even though one utility representative said agreement is far away. Davis' actions have fueled speculation that he's trying to force consensus by setting artificial deadlines and putting a spin on the news, and tarnishing the state's credibility in the process. ""I can't see how you would negotiate such a complex deal, like the purchase of the transmission grid, in such a short period of time. It doesn't seem realistic,"" said Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, an association of wholesale generators. ""I guess the people I represent have turned it off. They have stopped listening. They hear it and say, 'OK, sure. Here's another photo op.' "" Last Friday, Davis told a gathering of reporters that state officials and the utilities would agree by today on a rescue plan for the utilities. ""I believe we'll have agreement before next week is out, on exactly what should go in a piece of legislation,"" he said at the time. ""And hopefully, that legislation will be passed by the end of the following week."" Legislative veterans said his comments were ill-advised and unrealistic. Davis met into the night Thursday with top officials of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., but no agrement was reached. ""These are complicated problems that will not be solved overnight,"" said PG&E spokesman Ron Low. ""On some issues, we are very far away from agreement."" Sources said PG&E has been unwilling to negotiate sale of its transmission lines, which Davis has said is a necessary component of a deal. More progress was reported with the two other near-bankrupt companies -- San Diego Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison -- although sources said talks with them were far from concluded. Davis has been setting specific deadlines for himself and the Legislature for months: In November, the governor promised to present a comprehensive ""plan"" by Dec. 1 to stave off a full-blown energy crisis, but ended up offering only a modest slate of proposals. Davis called Feb. 12 a ""drop dead"" date by which he hoped to cement a deal between lawmakers and the utilities. There's no deal yet. Davis told reporters that he and the state's legislative leaders would reach a ""consensus agreement"" on the proposal to take to utilities by last Friday. It didn't happen; he made the announcement alone. Leon Panetta, a White House chief of staff under former President Clinton, said it's important that the governor set deadlines because the nature of politics is to delay. However, he cautioned against missing deadlines. ""You have to be careful that you keep the deadlines you establish, because the more that you establish and not meet, the more that begins to lose its value as a political tool,"" Panetta said. The governor can't continue to indefinitely set deadlines without facing consequences, cautioned Steven Fetter, managing director of the Global Power Group at Fitch, a credit-rating agency based in New York. At some point, he warned, creditors and power suppliers may push the utilities into involuntary bankruptcy, which would trigger an official deadline that can't be ignored. The dispute would be tied up in court at a judge's discretion. ""Eventually, there is going to be a real deadline,"" Fetter said. ""The problem is it's probably not a deadline that will be set by Gov. Davis. It's a deadline that will be set by the banks and the (electricity) suppliers."" In several cases when deadlines haven't been met, Davis has held a news conference regardless, unveiling little new information and scant detail. On Jan. 26, for instance, the governor promoted the broad framework of a plan to save the utilities rather than a detailed plan that had been anticipated. One prong of the plan: ""Aggressively promote energy efficiency, conservation and demand reduction among consumers, businesses and public entities."" Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said that the governor continues to set deadlines because it's important to show that the state is making progress, particularly to Wall Street. He added that it's not the governor's fault the deadlines have been missed. ""Many of the dates have been blown away by factors no one has been able to foresee or have control over: court decisions, actions by creditors, weather, you name it,"" Maviglio said. ""The governor sets deadlines that continue to move the ball forward and he has been successful at doing that."" Many of these announcements came after 2 p.m. on Fridays, triggering suggestions that the governor has attempted to spin the facts and manipulate the markets. Timing announcements after the close of East Coast financial markets is commonly used by politicians who don't want to send stocks soaring or tumbling by making an announcement, Panetta said. ""You want people to evaluate what's happening so there isn't a panic reaction to a news flash going over the wire,"" he said. But market analysts say that ever since PG&E and Edison stocks plummeted in early January, the governor's statements haven't significantly affected their performance. ""There has been so much news that has been so negative for the companies that I don't think it makes much of a difference,"" said Ed Schuller, a senior vice president for the full-service brokerage firm Sutro & Co. ""It's beyond that point now."" GOP Sees Power Crisis as Davis' Achilles' Heel Republicans line up to run for governor Friday,?February 23, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, politically wounded by the state's power woes, has become the target of a growing pack of Republicans looking to turn him out of office. ""Four months ago, Davis looked on track to get re-elected by a voice vote,"" said Dan Schnur, a GOP strategist. ""But the energy crisis has exposed vulnerabilities that have encouraged others to look at the (2002 governor's) race."" The governor's backers, however, are confident California voters will recognize Davis is dealing with a problem that has been brewing for years, through previous Republican administrations. ""If the Republicans want to have a full-out firefight over who brought this (energy crisis) down, we're ready for it,"" said Garry South, the governor's top political adviser. ""It's a fight they can't win."" With the primary election still more than a year away, no one but Davis is a sure bet to leap into the contest, but at least three names will be circulating when California Republicans meet in Sacramento this weekend for their state convention. Secretary of State Bill Jones, Los Angeles investor Bill Simon Jr. and actor Arnold Schwarzenegger all have made noises about challenging Davis, but so far their incipient campaigns have been more talk than action. Simon's effort might be the farthest along, but he also has the longest way to travel. A political unknown, the 49-year-old Simon runs his family's investment company and has been active in a number of charitable organizations in Southern California. Simon, whose father was treasury secretary under President Richard Nixon, has brought in veteran GOP consultant Sal Russo to study a possible run for governor. ""Bill Simon feels we need a governor who's prepared to lead and not one who's focused on fund-raising or the next political office,"" Russo said in a jab at Davis. Simon was an assistant U.S. attorney in New York, but founded William E. Simon & Sons with his brother and late father in 1988. The $2 billion private investment firm owns a number of companies and has also invested heavily in South of Market real estate in San Francisco. Wealthy political outsiders don't have an enviable record in recent California elections. Republican Michael Huffington spent $29 million to lose a 1994 Senate race to Dianne Feinstein. Darrell Issa dropped around $13 million in a losing race for the 1998 GOP Senate nomination. Al Checchi spent about $38 million of his own money to lose the Democratic primary to Davis in 1998. While Simon likely would be spending plenty of his own money on a governor's bid, he's working to get outside support, both political and financial, before committing to the race, Russo said. With the state's problems mounting and the economy increasingly shaky, the time may be ripe for a political unknown, he added. ""When things start going bad, people are willing to look outside for a new face, someone who will get things done,"" Russo said. Jones is anything but a political outsider. A veteran legislator from the Fresno area, he is now serving his second and last term as California's secretary of state. He managed to hang onto his job during the GOP's 1998 electoral debacle, which cost the party every other constitutional office. While Jones has long talked about a run for governor, he's still playing coy. ""We have not made any decision and probably won't make one until early March,"" said Rob Lapsley, one of Jones' top advisers. ""Right now we're putting together information for Bill to make a decision."" While Jones' role as the state's top GOP officeholder makes him an obvious choice to challenge Davis, he's made a number of political enemies over the years, many of them in his own party. His surprise decision last year to switch his support from George W. Bush to Arizona Sen. John McCain in California's presidential primary won him no fans among Bush supporters and could hurt his attempts to raise money for a gubernatorial bid. Money is a major problem for Jones, who listed $118,000 in his campaign fund last month, compared with nearly $26 million for Davis. Some of his opponents have suggested that fund-raising woes may force Jones to run for an office other than governor. ""Right now, we're focused on the governor's race,"" Lapsley insisted. The real Republican wild card is Schwarzenegger, the movie action hero who would be instantly recognized by nearly every California voter. While Schwarzenegger's publicist told The Chronicle last month that he had no plans to get involved in next year's governor's race, the Austrian-born star was on the telephone to a Los Angeles Times columnist days later, talking about his love for politics and his political ambitions. Fame, however, has its drawbacks, as the 53-year-old Schwarzenegger has found. An article in Premiere magazine entitled ""Arnold the Barbarian"" accused him of groping women on movie sets and generally boorish behavior, while the supermarket tabloids have him on the cover this week, suggesting that his marriage to Maria Shriver is on the rocks. South, Davis' political adviser, gleefully sent copies of the Premiere article to reporters across the state, suggesting that ""the piece lays out a real 'touching' story -- if you get what I mean."" Whoever ends up with the GOP nomination still will face an uphill battle against Davis, a popular governor and a ""take no prisoners"" campaigner. ""I've been predicting since Day One that the GOP would find some moneybags candidate to throw against Gray,"" South said. ""That's why we've kept our political and fund-raising operation going since election day."" Pressure Is on Utilities to Accept Grid Sale Energy: Gov. Davis wants accord today, but Edison executive says company might prefer bankruptcy. By DAN MORAIN and NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writers ?????SACRAMENTO--His credibility at risk and California's energy future on the line, Gov. Gray Davis on Thursday turned up the heat on the state's utilities to accept today a series of tentative rescue accords that would put the companies' transmission systems into public hands. ?????How far the utilities are willing to bend to the governor's intensified pressure was unclear late Thursday. Given Davis' mandate, a top executive of Southern California Edison said his company is now being forced to seriously contemplate whether it might fare better in Bankruptcy Court. ?????""We are weighing two very unpalatable alternatives,"" he said. ?????Two alternatives facing the utilities are either to sell their electrical transmission systems to the state at a price they consider too low or gamble in Bankruptcy Court that they could hang onto their valuable assets. ?????After nearly a week of negotiations, Davis administration officials said they hoped to announce today a partial deal that would calm the utilities' jittery creditors and help subdue California's runaway electricity market. ?????State officials said Thursday they were close to agreements with Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric but remained at odds with the state's biggest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, which has balked at giving up its transmission grid. ?????""These are complex issues that cannot be resolved overnight,"" said PG&E spokesman Ron Lowe. ""There are clearly some areas where we are very far apart."" ?????On Thursday, Edison Chairman John Bryson conferred with members of his utility's board of directors. But by evening, the company's top executives still had not decided whether to acknowledge that an agreement is near. ?????Although the utility has begun to contemplate the protections of bankruptcy, it is unclear when, or if, such a dramatic action would occur. ?????Davis is believed to be offering roughly $7 billion for the utilities' transmission grids. The companies could use the cash to restructure their debt, which resulted from the utilities' inability to pass along their soaring wholesale electricity costs to ratepayers. ?????Davis has significant political and fiscal reasons for wanting to make an announcement today. He is scheduled to arrive in Washington for the National Governor's Assn. conference this weekend, meet with U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham on Sunday, and attend the Democratic Governors Assn. annual fund-raising dinner Monday night. ?????Davis, a prodigious fund-raiser, is chairman of the Democratic Governors Assn., and the dinner is expected to raise more than $5 million. Of that amount, Davis' political organization raised in excess of $1 million, said Garry South, his chief political advisor. ?????Any progress Davis can cite could help improve his national political standing. But his aides say it's especially important to be able to show at least a semblance of an agreement when he travels to New York on Wednesday to confer with Wall Street analysts. ?????On Thursday, those analysts reacted exuberantly to early hints from the governor's office that settlements with the utilities might be announced. ?????The recently anemic stocks of Edison International and PG&E Corp. soared on the New York Stock Exchange on a day when most utility stocks closed lower. ?????Edison jumped $1.50 per share, or 11.15%, to close at $14.95 while PG&E gained $1.49, or 11.41%, to $14.55 per share. ?????""That suggests that someone thinks something good is happening in Sacramento,"" said analyst James D. von Riesemann of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. ?????But some analysts fear investor enthusiasm might be hasty. ?????""I'm concerned that the governor's optimism may not coincide with all the parties at the table and it may not coincide with the Legislature,"" said Paul Patterson, utility analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. ?????Davis met Thursday with Steve Baum, chairman of Sempra, the parent company of SDG&E. Administration officials are confident that an agreement can be reached. But the San Diego company is the smallest of the state's three major private utilities, and its debt is far smaller--$605 million, compared to the combined $12.7 billion that Edison and PG&E say they have amassed. ?????""[Baum] is willing to listen,"" said Sempra spokesman Doug Kline. "" . . . We're on the record as stating that we are willing to consider the sale of those [transmission] assets if it helps solve the crisis."" ?????PG&E executives had been scheduled to start meeting with Davis at 11 a.m. Thursday. But in what was seen a slight against PG&E, Davis' aides did not summon negotiators for the Northern California utility, including company Chairman Robert Glynn, until after 3:30. ?????Although the parties continued to wrangle over details, there was progress Thursday on the sidelines. ?????State officials announced they had signed a long-term contract for a relatively small amount of electricity with a major energy supplier--an achievement that was perhaps more symbolic than substantive. ?????Tulsa-based Williams Cos. said it had agreed to a 10-year deal to sell power to the Department of Water Resources. By April, the company will provide at least 175 megawatts--enough electricity to supply 175,000 homes--at times of the day when demand for electricity soars. Such peak supplies will increase through next summer and reach 900 megawatts by 2006, according to Williams. ?????The agreement is only the second such long-term contract since Davis signed a bill Feb. 1 putting the Department of Water Resources into the power-buying business for many years to come. ?????At least 10 other power suppliers have reached understandings with the state, Davis said Wednesday. But those companies refuse to sign deals, the governor said, until the state finds a way to help California's two biggest utilities pay off their billion-dollar debts. ?????""As soon as we revitalize the utilities,"" the governor said, ""I think you'll see a lot of movement on long-term contracts."" ?????Another small but important piece of the state's energy plan emerged Thursday when legislation was introduced by Sen. Jim Battin (R-La Quinta) to slash the rates paid to alternative energy producers--a move expected to shave $3 billion or more in annual costs charged to the big private utilities. Reducing the amount paid to producers of renewable energy such as solar, wind and biomass power is considered a crucial step in keeping expected consumer rate hikes down. ?????And, after 40 days of dangerously low electricity supplies, the state got a reprieve Thursday morning when grid officials lifted the state's ""electrical emergency"" status for the first time since Jan. 13. ?????So far, the state has spent nearly $2 billion buying electricity on behalf of the utilities, according to the Department of Finance, which informed the Legislature on Thursday that it will release another $500 million for electricity purchases. --- ?????Times staff writers Nancy Rivera Brooks, Nancy Cleeland and Mitchell Landsberg in Los Angeles and Julie Tamaki and Jenifer Warren in Sacramento contributed to this story. Energy Firms Won't Pay All of Monster Debt PUC reverses, taxpayers could foot the bill Christian Berthelsen, Chronicle Staff Writer Friday,?February 23, 2001 Under a ruling yesterday by state regulators, California taxpayers could be on the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars in power purchases the state has made in behalf of two troubled utilities. The California Public Utilities Commission voted unanimously to absolve Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison of responsibility for any costs above the revenue they collect from ratepayers. The ruling reversed a position taken earlier by the commission, which had said the utilities were responsible for making up the difference between the state's costs and their own revenue. John Tremaine, a PG&E spokesman, said the funding needed to make up the difference could come in the form of a surcharge imposed on customers who use 130 percent of the baseline amount of electricity. That is one option under a bill passed last month by the Legislature, he said. But Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, said the governor does not believe the money will come from ratepayers' electric bills. The costs, Maviglio said, could be covered by the $10 billion bond measure the state recently issued to cover power purchases. As California tries to resolve its power crisis, state officials are working out the precise way that should be done. Under the state's deregulation plan approved in 1996, the utilities have been forced to absorb skyrocketing wholesale electricity costs while being prevented by law from passing the increases on to customers through higher rates. Since the California Department of Water Resources began buying power last month, details showing how it will be repaid, how much or by whom have not been established. Yesterday's PUC decision was an attempt to begin setting the repayment criteria. A precise accounting of how much money is at stake is impossible to determine at this point, officials said, because PG&E declines to release ratepayer revenue figures, and the state is refusing to say exactly how much it has spent buying power. Officials estimate the state will spend $2.3 billion by the beginning of March and Davis authorized the expenditure of $500 million more yesterday. The state's Department of Water Resources became the buyer of record on Jan. 17 when the two utilities' credit was so damaged that they were no longer able to buy power. Both utilities had opposed the commission's previous position that they be responsible for all power costs. The PUC's shift yesterday was summed up by Commissioner Richard Bilas, who said he could not support holding the utilities responsible for the revenue shortfall. ""The DWR is not about to go bankrupt; the utilities are,"" he said. Yet consumer advocates downplayed the commission's ruling yesterday. Nettie Hoge, executive director of The Utility Reform Network, said the ruling only dealt with the narrow issue of who has to account for the revenue shortfall, and did not reach an overarching decision about who, ultimately, will be financially responsible for it. ""This is not a huge deal,"" she said. The state has been buying the lion's share of its power in the real-time market run by the Independent System Operator since the demise of the longer- term California Power Exchange, said Jesus Arredondo, a spokesman for the exchange. The state has been paying premium prices because it is buying in a market that was designed to handle last-minute emergencies. The governor's office has been seeking cheaper, long-term power contracts with only modest results. Small electric producers OK big price cut By Ed Mendel STAFF WRITER February 23, 2001 SACRAMENTO -- Legislators said yesterday that small generators who produce about 30 percent of the state's power have agreed to cut their power prices in half, an important step toward easing the electricity crisis. Negotiations continued on what Gov. Gray Davis has called the final step: the state purchase of the transmission systems of the three investor-owned utilities in exchange for paying off their huge debt. Meanwhile, the amount that the state is spending to buy power for the customers of the utilities grows. Officials gave notice that an additional $500 million will be needed in 10 days, bringing the total to $2.6 billion. But for the first time in nearly six weeks the state did not declare an alert yesterday due to power shortages. More power was available from other states, and some power plants that had been shut down for maintenance resumed operation. Two legislators, Sen. Jim Battin, R-Palm Desert, and Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, said they introduced legislation that sharply reduces the prices paid to small generators after weeks of difficult negotiations. ""Ultimately, this bill will reduce the cost of energy to the state and its ratepayers by billions of dollars,"" said Battin, who represents eastern San Diego County. About half of the small generators use ""renewable"" technologies such as solar, wind, geothermal and biomass. The rest is ""co-generation,"" when fuel is used for industrial purposes and electricity is generated as a by-product. The small generators have grown to produce nearly a third of California's power under a two-decade-old federal ""qualifying facilities"" program, which requires utilities to buy their power. Battin and Keeley said that under the bill, SB 47X, the average price for these QF contracts could drop from the current 17 cents per kilowatt-hour to about 8 to 8.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. ""We believe that the rates are at least that low, if not lower,"" said Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers, which represents small and large generators. The small generators support the bill because it will give them a stable price for five years, avoiding ups and downs and the possibility that state regulators might make a more unfavorable price cut. Much of the current price formula is based on the price of natural gas at the California border, which has soared this winter. The legislation spreads the price bench mark over a five-year period. ""We encourage the Legislature to take quick action to approve SB 47X as quickly as possible to help stabilize the electricity crisis,"" Smutny-Jones said. He said one of the side agreements to the legislation is the creation of a portfolio of long-term contracts to purchase natural gas for some co-generators, lowering their production costs. The legislation was applauded as ""a major step forward"" by a group of small generators who formed a creditors committee last week and threatened to take the utilities into bankruptcy. ""We call on the Legislature and the governor to act on it immediately,"" said Chris Thompson, a spokesman for the group. Thompson said Southern California Edison continues to collect money from ratepayers, as the state buys power for its customers, but is not paying anything to the small non-polluting generators. A spokesman for a geothermal generator in El Centro, which filed a lawsuit seeking $45 million from Edison for power provided since November, welcomed the legislation for giving generators stability and ratepayers cheaper power. But Vince Signorotti, a spokesman for CalEnergy, said it would be ""premature"" to consider dropping the lawsuit. Battin and Keeley said that payment of the small generators depends on the governor's attempt to negotiate the purchase of the transmission systems of Edison, Pacific Gas and Electric, and San Diego Gas and Electric in exchange for payment of their debt. As part of the governor's plan, the utilities would agree to provide low-cost power for five to 10 years from their generators, which provide about a third of the state's power. Davis aides are attempting to negotiate long-term contracts with generators for the remaining third of the power required by the state, sharply reducing the cost of buying power on the expensive spot market. But the governor said this week that many generators are reluctant to sign long-term contracts until they know how the utilities will pay their debt for previous power purchases. The state called off all power alerts yesterday for the first time since mid-January, rescinding a Stage 1 alert declared Wednesday. Grid operators made the change after increased power supplies became available. ""The supply situation this week has gradually been improving,"" said Lorie O'Donley, a spokeswoman with the California Independent System Operator, which manages most of the state's power supplies. However, she said the improvements shouldn't deter consumers from conservation. ""It is good news to be out of electrical emergencies but we just want to remind everybody that we are looking at a long-term power supply situation here,"" she said. ""And the high-demand summer is just around the corner. So we would ask that people continue with their conservation efforts."" In San Francisco yesterday, state power regulators decided unanimously that the Department of Water Resources is responsible for buying any power that cash-strapped utilities are unable to generate or buy on their own -- no matter what price wholesalers are charging. But the PUC voted 3-2 against taking action that would have allowed the DWR to receive a portion of ratepayer revenues from the utilities to help cover the cost of buying electricity. The state, through the DWR, was authorized by a recent law to buy power for the utilities. Edison and PG&E have such low credit ratings that no power companies will sell to them. SDG&E's rating is much better, but its debt also was mounting. The DWR purchases that portion of electricity beyond what the utilities provide through their own generating plants and through existing long-term contracts. But the DWR has refused to buy power beyond a certain price. That means more last-minute power purchases on the expensive spot market. The utilities and the state had disagreed over how the DWR will be reimbursed -- whether through state bonds or ratepayer dollars -- and the extent of its power-buying role. The author of the bill authorizing the long-term contracts, Assemblyman Keeley, said the legislation's intent was to fully cover the one-third of the power that utilities purchased on the spot market, either through extended contracts or through the state ISO.

I have summarized the main visibility we received. There were several more ""freebies"" in the end, but they are not accounted for in the following: We had a total of 40 thirty-second commercials that ran on NBC and TNT (the Turner Network). We also had 8-10 billboards which said ""This portion of Wimbledon was brought to you by Enron, a leading energy and broadband services company."" The broadcaster who announced the match also gave us plugs by saying, ""Watch this on the net at www.wimbledon.net, streamed by Enron."" There was a banner floating across the bottom of the page saying that as well. Additionally we received ad time and billboards on ESPN, CNNsi and several other networks. We had banners streaming on up to 10 websites, including www.msnbc.com, www.cnnsi.com and www.wimbledon.net. There was also a static banner on the Wimbledon Channel, no matter which site you watched it on (Wimbledon, CNNsi or MSNBC). All the banners took you to a jump page we created, located at www.enron.net/wimbledon. At Wimbledon we had 12 courtside seats and 24 grounds passes. I was also told that we had a small paid contract with FastTV.com to stream the archived site. We released a press release on our services with IBM, IMG, TWII and Wimbledon several days into the event; and EBS sent out an email to top clients/potential clients directing them to the site. Business Week is also releasing a profile on Enron in their upcoming eBiz section, which features the Wimbledon Club as a customer. Please let me know if you have any questions I can answer.

<22207429.1075851975919.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,House Energy Committee Passes First Energy Package,"Late this morning, the House Energy and Commerce Committee adoped the committee print, as amended, of an energy package that addresses conservation, clean coal, renewables, hydro, nuclear, and boutique fuels. The vote was 50 to 5 to report the bill. Other committees -- Ways and Means, Science, and Resources -- also moved their energy bills this week. Thus, the House is on track to consider a merged package before the start of the August Recess on August 3rd. As to electricity, during the several days of debate this week both Chairmen Tauzin and Barton reaffirmed their intention to next move to electricity issues. Mr. Barton's staff advised me this morning that the subcommittee he chairs will hold a hearing on Friday, July 20th on all electricity issues other than transmission. While Mr. Barton has publicly held out hope of marking up an electricity bill this month, sources on and off the committee do not see this timetable as realistic. On the Senate side, the majority staff is working on an electricity ""white paper"" that may be circulated for comment next week. Below is a recap of action on amendments of interest to Enron: 1. Last night, on a largely partisan vote (with Democrats Hall, Green and John voting with the Republicans) the Committee rejected an amendment by Rep. Jane Harman (D-CA) (that was to have been offered by Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA)) that would have retroactively amended the FERC refund date and essentially ordered refunds regardless of amounts owed to power sellers. 2. First thing this morning the Committee, again on a largely partisan basis (with Democrats Hall, Green, John and Towns), rejected a Waxman amendment to impose cost-of-service rates on all power in the West (other than generation added after 1/1/01). (Originally, Mr. Waxman was going to offer amendment to impose cost-of-service rates only on those who do not supply all available power during an emergency, but he ended up offering basically what he had pursued in subcommittee on the old ""Californa Only"" bill.) 3. The Committee adopted an amendment by Rep. Shadegg to amend the Natural Gas Act to make it clear that a natural gas ""transportation facility"" shall not be added to the National Register of Historic Places until FERC has abandoned the facility. Apparently there have been some instances of ""old"" pipelines being considered as ""historic places"" under federal law. The House Resources Committee added a similar amendment to its package yesterday. 4. By voice vote, the Committee rejected a Waxman Amendment to require the president to propose and implement a plan to bring U.S. greenhouse gases down to 1990 levels. There was strong opposition voiced by many Republicans and Democrats to this amendment. 5. By mixed vote of 24 to 29, the Committee defeated a Waxman Amendment to set cost and performance goals for renewables, including wind power, and authorize federal funds to assist with commercial project costs (up to 50 percent).",Company Business/Strategy

Venki Venkateshwara DATE: March 27, 2001 California Power Crisis Update (No. 10) DEVELOPMENTS THIS WEEK, 3/23/2001 The weeks highlights include: ? Continued indications that the issue of market power and possible remedies for it is likely to remain a high profile issue in California and elsewhere (both retroactively and prospectively) ? An ironical situation with respect to QFs in which QF power under contract is effectively being released into the market at higher prices ? A court order requiring Reliant to continue to sell power to the ISO even if it is not being paid in a full and timely manner ? Another Stage 3 emergency and rolling blackouts Market power There are continued indications that the issue of market power will not be settled simply. This week there was a lengthy and politically influential front page story in the New York Times about FERCs passive approach to policing generators (Critics Say U.S. Energy Agency Is Weak in Oversight of Utilities). The story was by Jeff Gerth and Joseph Kahn. (Jeff Gerth's 1992 story on the Whitewater deal is viewed by journalists to have been the origin of what eventually became a multi-year investigation of Bill Clinton.) The key issues are familiar: ? Does market power exist to a degree that warrants remedies such as price caps, refunds, and so on? ? If so, what is the basis for asserting that market power exists and what is the remedy? (See the discussion in the New York Times article on the ""good hours"" vs. ""bad hours"" approach and the associated political decision not to deal with ""good hours""). ? Can market power be used as leverage to eventually settle generator bills in California at something less than 100 cents on the dollar. (The California ISO filed a complaint claiming $6 billion in overcharges this week.) The QF irony Through the 1990s, QF contracts were projected to be the source of stranded costs because they were priced ""way above market."" In recent months, in California, they look like a bargain (although some are not such great bargains because a portion of their price is tied to gas). You would think that the utilities would request QFs to maximize their output. But credit problems have created an ironical situation. The facts: ? PG&E and Edison have not been paying the QFs fully and promptly for some time. ? The QFs form a creditors committee and threaten to push PG&E and Edison into bankruptcy. (Some gas-fired QFs had to shut down because they did not have money to pay for the gas.) ? Last week's court decision allows MidAmerican/CalEnergy to essentially sell its power to others even though the QF contract ""dedicates"" the output to the purchasing utility. ? CalEnergy does so immediately, selling to El Paso. The Reliant Order A court ordered Reliant to continue to sell to the ISO, when requested, regardless of whether Reliant had been paid fully and promptly for past deliveries to the ISO. Reliant announced it will appeal the order. This is somewhat of a contrast to the QF situation except that the circumstances governing the 2 situations are probably different. The QF contracts pre-date the ISO and are with the utilities and most likely make no reference to providing power during emergencies. In fact, many QF contracts have the opposite provision: authority for the utility to cut takes during so-called ""light load"" periods. Stage 3 emergency and rolling blackouts--again There was another Stage 3 emergency in California ? with rolling blackouts this week. This prompted everyone to wonder why this was happening in March. Among the factors: ? Increased demand from summer-like temperatures ? Cutbacks in imports ? Loss of 1400 MW due to a transformer fire at an Edison plant ? Loss of about 3100 MW from QF plants that were forced to shutdown because they could not afford gas bills (VV) MARKET COMMENTARY (For easier printing of all the articles in this section use the file at the end of the section) Critics Say U.S. Energy Agency Is Weak in Oversight of Utilities By JEFF GERTH and JOSEPH KAHN 03/23/2001 The New York Times Page 1, Column 1 c. 2001 New York Times Company WASHINGTON, March 22 -- The pressure was intense when federal regulators met privately last month to debate remedies for soaring electricity prices in California. Officials of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency whose mandate is to ensure ''just and reasonable'' electricity rates nationwide, had evidence that a few companies had been selling electricity to California at prices far above the cost of generating it. The agency faced an imminent deadline to challenge those prices or let the companies possibly pocket hundreds of millions of dollars in unfair profits. An internal memorandum laid out two choices. The agency could audit and punish ''bad actors,'' the companies that were exploiting the market. Or it could identify ''bad hours,'' when electricity shortages were most acute and spiking prices were arguably nobody's fault, and order refunds for only the most exorbitant prices. ''It may be easier to identify bad hours than bad actors,'' the memorandum said. The commission took the easier way. It decided not to investigate reports of abuses by companies, but issued an order that could require them to refund to the state utilities up to $124 million collected during a relatively few ''bad hours'' in January and February. That is hundreds of millions of dollars less than California might have claimed, since the most potential overcharging occurred during ''good hours,'' when power was more plentiful but prices were often just as extreme. The order ignored those hours. Today, in a criticism of the agency's lack of aggressiveness, California regulators estimated that generators had charged $6.2 billion above competitive levels over 10 months. They urged the agency to dig deeper, hoping it would demand more refunds or other stiff remedies. But the agency's track record -- one of complacency in the eyes of state officials -- leaves California regulators skeptical that Washington will confront the big power producers. The small, obscure agency, tucked behind the rail yard of Union Station here, has largely soft-pedaled its role as the electricity industry's top cop, even though it has wide authority to keep power companies in line. To keep rates reasonable, it can impose price caps, strip companies of the right to charge market rates, force them to return excessive profits and even suspend deregulation altogether. Instead, the agency has largely left it to private companies to pry open the $250 billion electricity industry, which has historically been controlled by monopoly utilities and state officials. The agency's defenders, including its chairman, Curt Hebert Jr., a fierce advocate of unfettered markets, say that its largely hands-off approach reflects the delicate balancing of competing interests -- a commitment to protect consumers while not stifling market forces. But politicians, utility executives, energy economists and local regulators say California's rolling blackouts and skyrocketing electricity prices are the signs of a market running amok. They accuse the agency of standing aside as companies manipulate their way to windfall profits. The agency's critics, who include one of its own commissioners and numerous staff members, say that its enforcement mission has been blunted by free-market passions and the influence of industry insiders in its ranks. When the agency began its first national investigation of high electricity prices last year, it named a newly recruited industry insider, Scott Miller, to lead the effort. Mr. Miller and his colleagues said in their report that there was ''insufficient data'' in California to prove any profiteering by generating companies. Yet his own former employer, PG&E Energy Trading, was at the time a subject of a civil antitrust investigation by the Justice Department that focused on electricity market abuses in New England. The agency has given state regulators a lead role in monitoring local power markets. Yet even as these regulators have urged the agency to be more aggressive in investigating suspicions that companies have abused their power in California, New England, the Midwest and the mid-Atlantic, they have frequently been ignored or rebuffed. Critics say that the agency began deregulation before it was ready or willing to make sure the markets worked effectively. They accuse it of showing favoritism to industry -- allowing companies, for example, to ignore requirements to file detailed reports of market transactions that are critical to proving accusations of market abuses. ''We need to wake up to the fact that this is a dysfunctional market that is being gamed and manipulated by those who participate in it,'' said William Massey, a commissioner of the agency who has become one of its leading critics. The agency's inaction, the critics say, leads to ''gaming'' -- jockeying for profits that does not necessarily involve illegality -- and outright market manipulation. Consumers and utilities are the victims, paying billions of dollars more for electricity than if the markets were truly competitive. Agency officials acknowledge that enforcement of market rules to curb gaming and manipulation had not been a high priority in previous years. But they defended their recent California order as proof that they intend to keep markets free of abuse. They add that the agency is also pressuring two generators to refund almost $11 million for possibly manipulating the California market last spring. Agency officials and some outside analysts say that poorly conceived deregulation plans by states, a shortage of power plants, rising natural gas prices, and even the weather have had more impact on electricity prices than abuses by companies or any failings by the agency. They say the agency must balance the competing interests of generators, local regulators and utility companies if it is to keep deregulation on track. ''We're trying to craft a system that gives breathing room to develop a market, but not so much room that undue market power punishes consumers,'' Mr. Hebert said. Fight Over Deregulation Today's debate traces back to the 1930's, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt backed legislation to break up utility monopolies. The Federal Power Act of 1935 gave the Federal Power Commission a mandate to ensure ''just and reasonable'' electricity rates. The Federal Power Commission was abolished in 1977 and replaced by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, an independent agency with 1,200 employees that also oversees oil pipelines and the natural gas market. The president appoints the chairman and four commissioners -- two Democrats and two Republicans with staggered terms of five years. Two Republican seats are currently unfilled. The deregulation of the electricity markets began in the late 1980's, after the agency had begun opening the gas markets. By 1996, the commissioners issued a landmark order that forced utility companies to open their transmission lines to other utilities and electricity wholesalers. The commission and many private economists expected that by prying open protected markets, electricity prices would immediately fall. That possibility set off a deregulation frenzy, most prominently in California, New York, New England and the mid-Atlantic states. Generating companies rushed to expand in the new, borderless market. But the agency's balancing act has grown more difficult as electricity deregulation has spread nationwide. Congress has forced it to trim its staff in recent years. Officials complain that investigating abuses in electricity markets strains their resources. And as the California crisis has worsened, the commissioners have begun sparring publicly among themselves about what to do. This week, Mr. Massey, a Democratic commissioner, and Mr. Hebert (pronounced AY-bear), a Republican, sat side by side before a House panel and argued diametrically opposed positions. Mr. Hebert said high prices in California ''were sending the right signals to get supply there.'' Mr. Massey called the prices that generators were charging ''unlawful'' and said that his agency, by not reining them in, ''is simply not doing its job.'' The agency's leadership has been in flux for months. Congressional and industry officials in Washington say President Bush is considering replacing Mr. Hebert, whom he named to the top post less than two months ago, with Pat Wood, who runs the Texas public utility commission. A White House spokeswoman had no comment on the reports. Though Mr. Hebert's positions are not far from those of the Bush administration, his relations with California leaders may have made his position tenuous. Mr. Hebert, a Mississippian who is a close ally of the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, has warred with California politicians who have proposed new solutions to the crisis there. Mr. Hebert, who has served as a commissioner since 1997, has often taken the most ideologically free-market position of any commissioner. He flatly rejects the idea of price caps on electricity as hopelessly ineffective and contrary to market forces. When Gov. Gray Davis outlined a plan to have the state buy transmission lines to relieve utility companies' debt, Mr. Hebert's response was dismissive. ''It's not in the interest of the American public,'' he pronounced. Even as new electricity markets opened in the summer of 1999, they started producing nasty shocks. The mid-Atlantic region experienced some early volatility. As the turmoil grew, economists began raising the alarm about a phenomenon called ''market power,'' the ability of energy traders in the new national market to sustain prices above the competitive level. Proving such abuses is difficult, because it requires comparing tens of thousands of separate electricity transactions with the costs of the generators that initiated them. Joseph Bowring, who heads the market monitoring unit of the nonprofit entity that operates the mid-Atlantic transmission system, said that power companies there had exercised some market power. But only the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, not local regulators, had the authority to collect the data to determine how much market power had been exercised and whether it had been abusive or not, he said. Mr. Bowring said he talked to agency officials about doing so. In the end, Mr. Bowring and several agency officials said, the agency chose not to investigate. The decision roiled some agency officials. Ron Rattey, a veteran agency economist, wrote a memorandum last June describing the staff as ''impotent in our ability to monitor, foster, and ensure competitive electric power markets.'' The staff, the memorandum said, did not even enforce a requirement that power companies file detailed quarterly reports listing essentially every sale they make. Such data would have been useful to Mr. Bowring. Local-Federal Clash Local regulators who want to ensure competitive prices often have to act on their own. Monitors in New England have intervened about 600 times since 1999 to correct prices they determined had been caused, at least in part, by market manipulation. The federal agency has sometimes chastised them for interfering too much. The industry, not surprisingly, shares that view. One vocal critic was Mr. Miller. Before the agency recruited him last July to head its division of energy markets, he was director of policy coordination for the national energy-trading unit of PG&E Corporation, the California holding company whose assets also include Pacific Gas and Electric, the California utility. Although the utility has lost billions of dollars during California's crisis, Mr. Miller's former unit has become one of the most profitable new energy traders nationwide. PG&E Energy Trading, by several estimates, is now the second-largest seller of electricity in New England. The company has had a rocky relationship with regulators. They intervened several times in 1999 and 2000 to retroactively cancel auctions they said produced excessive profits for PG&E and other companies. Mr. Miller denounced the practice, though he acknowledged in public testimony that his company sometimes charged ''very high'' prices when it could. ''One person's predatory pricing is another person's competitive advantage,'' Mr. Miller said at a public hearing on deregulation in Texas in 1999. New England regulators too often acted as ''judge, jury and executioner'' when overseeing the market, he said. One year later, Mr. Miller and his new colleagues at the federal agency got a chance to examine New England's problems from the regulators' perspective. Their Nov. 1 report attributed New England's frequent price gyrations to technical and regulatory flaws. As Mr. Miller's team was preparing its report, the Justice Department, whose threshold for stepping into possible industry wrongdoing is far higher than the agency's, began looking into whether price spikes in New England pointed to unlawful monopoly power or collusion, people contacted by the department during that inquiry said. One subject of the civil inquiry is possible price manipulation in one of New England's ancillary services markets, people contacted by the department said. They said the department was examining whether PG&E and two other companies tried to corner that market for several months early last year. PG&E confirmed that the Justice Department had contacted it, but denies wrongdoing and says it has cooperated with the department's requests. Mr. Miller has declined to comment on his role at PG&E or at the agency. His supervisors defended his work and said they had detected no conflict of interest between his work at PG&E and his duties at the agency. Those duties brought Mr. Miller to California last August. With electricity prices there soaring, he and his colleagues sat down with several utility executives at the agency's San Francisco office. One executive, Gary Stern, director of market monitoring for Southern California Edison, wanted the agency to stop what he suspected were market abuses by power generators. He provided a road map to help investigators figure out how power companies traded power contracts -- and whether they had manipulated the markets. But when Mr. Miller and his team approached 11 generators and marketers -- including his old employer -- a few weeks later, they did it their way. They asked eight questions, many of them imprecise, like: ''Describe your strategy for bidding generation resources into market.'' This question, Mr. Stern said in a recent interview, ''was equivalent to asking a suspected burglar how he spent his day.'' Some agency officials also thought the team should probe deeper. Mr. Rattey recommended that Mr. Miller seek the quarterly pricing reports that marketers were supposed to file. But his suggestion was not adopted, agency records show. Daniel Larcamp, Mr. Miller's supervisor, said ''there might have been more information that could have been obtained'' in the California inquiry. But he said the commission gave the staff only three months to finish, making it impossible to collect and analyze the reams of data involved. For Mr. Miller, agency documents show, the investigation was so time-consuming that he had no time to fill out the financial disclosure form required of new federal employees. Mr. Miller submitted his form in late January, after a reporter requested it. Agency lawyers approved the form, but only after he provided additional information about his job and compensation from PG&E. The lawyers said Mr. Miller's participation had been permissible because PG&E was not the subject of the investigation. When the staff report was issued on Nov. 1, it found high prices and problems in the design of the California market. But while the companies ''had the potential to exercise market power,'' the commission said, there was ''insufficient data'' to prove that they did. Some marketers saw the report as an exoneration. ''This has been looked at several times, most notably by the FERC and nobody has found any evidence of market manipulation and profiteering,'' Rob Doty, the chief financial officer of Dynegy Inc., told a reporter earlier this year. California Inquiry The agency has recently shown signs of wanting to apply pressure on generators. But its early efforts show how it is treading on new and uncertain turf. When the California crisis grew severe last December, the commission issued a refund order, a shot across the bow for generators charging high prices. It required them to submit detailed data any time they sold electricity in California for more than $150 per megawatt hour, considered at the time a fair estimate of the highest costs any of them faced. It also told generators that for the next several months, they could be forced to give refunds if the agency found that they had charged excessive prices. The commission also said that it would examine bidding practices and strategies for withholding generating capacity to ferret out any efforts to artificially raise prices. When the agency's own 60-day deadline for examining market data in January approached, however, it became clear that staff members had not made any detailed examination. Instead, staff members said, the agency scrambled to forge a last-minute compromise that would allow it to issue a statement opposing high prices in the state without a time-consuming investigation. During this scramble, a senior staff member, Kevin Kelly, suggested focusing on bad hours instead of bad actors. ''Our attempts to find illegal behavior or legal 'misbehavior' by sellers ('bad actors') always seems to fail,'' his memorandum said. It said that the agency could more easily blame high prices on acute shortages during the most critical hours. The suggestion won the day. The commission decided to limit its order to the hours when California declared a Stage 3 emergency, when supplies are critically low. Mr. Stern of Southern California Edison and several private-sector economists have attacked the economic logic of that order. They said that the commission has focused on times when prices might be legitimately high. The bigger worry: Generators can and often do sustain artificially high prices when supplies are not as tight, they say. Mr. Massey, the Democratic commissioner, dissented from the decision for those reasons. Because most high-priced transactions in January and February did not occur during bad hours, he argued, the commission effectively chose to bless as ''just and reasonable'' the hefty profits generators are making from the California crisis. ''The problem with my agency is that we're so carried away with the rhetoric of markets that we've gotten sloppy,'' Mr. Massey said. ''We're talking about electricity. It's the juice of the economy, so it's got to be available and reasonably priced.'' Williams defends pricing of electricity 03/23/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. TULSA, Okla. (AP) - Williams Cos. Inc. says it can justify the rates it charged for wholesale power, despite accusations from federal regulators that it sold over-priced electricity to California. Federal regulators claim Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co., a unit of Tulsa-based Williams, owes California more than $40 million in refunds for power it sold to the state's Independent System Operator. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission says that Williams is one of several power providers responsible for $124 million in overcharges from transactions in January and February. The Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power grid, claims the state was overcharged $6.2 billion by 21 wholesale power providers, including Williams, between May and February. Williams says the rates it charged California were fair and were based on production costs and market conditions. ""Williams is confident that it performed within the guidelines established by the ISO,"" said Williams spokeswoman Paula Hall Collins. ""We felt like we had worked within the regulations set up by ISO."" According to the commission, power prices levied by Williams in January and February exceeded federal price ceilings based on the cost of natural gas and other market conditions. However, the price ceilings were established after the ISO accepted Williams' power prices, Collins said. The commission will review Williams' explanation and either accept the justification or order the company to pay refunds. Allegheny Energy makes big California connection 03/23/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. HAGERSTOWN, Md. (AP) - Allegheny Energy Inc. said Thursday it has agreed to sell $4.5 billion worth of power to California's electricity-purchasing agency over the next 10 years. The company said the contract call for Allegheny to provide up to 1,000 megawatts that the Hagerstown-based company has secured from western generating plants through its new energy trading division, Allegheny Energy Global Markets - formerly Merrill Lynch Global Energy Markets. ""This is a win-win for both the state of California and Allegheny Energy. It provides a long-term source of fixed-price energy and should help to stabilize prices in California,"" said Michael P. Morrell, president of the Allegheny Energy Supply division. Allegheny Energy is the parent of Allegheny Power, which delivers electric energy and natural gas to parts of Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia. Williams plans expansion of pipeline to help power Calif. 03/23/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - The Williams Cos. plans to expands its Kern River pipeline, which runs through Utah, to provide more natural gas for generating plants in California. Williams' gas pipeline unit in Salt Lake City said Thursday that it plans to construct nearly 700 miles of additional pipeline that will run parallel to its existing Kern River line. Construction on the $1 billion project is expected to begin next year and is scheduled for completion in May 2003, said Kirk Morgan, director of business development for Kern River pipeline. ""Shippers are seeking more access to natural gas from the Rocky Mountain basin, where producers are aggressively stepping up production,"" Morgan said. The new pipeline is expected to deliver about 900 million cubic feet of natural gas per day to markets in Utah, Nevada and California. Most of the gas will be used for generating plants planned in California. If all of the pipeline's capacity were used to generate electricity, it could produce about 5,400 megawatts. ""That is enough to light around 4.5 million homes,"" Morgan said. The original Kern River line was completed in 1992. It enters Utah from Wyoming then crosses into the Salt Lake Valley near Bountiful. It turns south near the Salt Lake City International Airport then runs the length of the state before passing into southern Nevada and winding up near Bakersfield, Calif. It currently transports 700 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. Williams, based in Tulsa, Okla., recently filed an emergency application with federal regulators to install additional pumping stations on the line to increase its capacity by 135 million cubic feet per day. That $81 million pumping station project should be completed by July 1. During the 2002 construction period, the Kern River project will employ between 1,500 and 1,800 people. The company estimates annual property taxes it pays to Utah counties will increase from $3.5 million to about $7 million. Questar will be one of the customers on the new pipeline, Morgan said. The utility wants to supply additional gas to southern Utah cities, including St. George and Cedar City. ""Our own pipelines serving southern Utah are at full capacity so this is an opportunity to transport additional gas into those areas from company-owned supplies in Wyoming,"" said Questar Gas spokeswoman Audra Sorensen. Calif Energy Commission OKs 3 Pwr Plants Worth 2,076 MW 03/23/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) (This article was originally published Thursday) LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California Energy Commission Wednesday approved three power plants worth 2,076 megawatts, two of which are scheduled to come on line by the end of 2002, a CEC spokesman said Thursday. The plants approved include BP Amoco PLC (BP) unit ARCO Western Energy's 500 megawatt Western Midway Sunset Project, slated to come on line in October 2002; Caithness Energy's 520 MW Blythe Power Plant, to come on line by Dec. 31, 2002; and Thermo Ecotek's 1,056 MW Mountainview Power Plant, scheduled to come on line in April 2003. All three of the new plants will be natural gas-fired combined-cycle plants. The $550 million Mountainview plant will be located in Southern California, near San Bernadino. The $300 million Western Midway-Sunset plant will be located in central Kern County, while the $250 million Blythe plant will be located in the city of Blythe in Riverside County. The latest approvals bring to 13 the total number of plants approved since April 1999 by the CEC, a spokesman said. Those plants will supply 8,405 MW to the state, which has seen rolling blackouts and spiking wholesale power prices in the last six months, in part due to lack of supply. -By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872; jessica.berthold@dowjones.com Some CalEnergy Power Could Be Sold Outside Calif - CEO 03/23/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) (This article was originally published Thursday) LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Some of CalEnergy Operating Corp's power could end up being sold outside of California, though that is not the company's intent, CalEnergy Chairman and CEO David Sokol said in a conference call Thursday. CalEnergy, an affiliate of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co, which is majority owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire-Hathaway (BRKA), was given legal authority Thursday to suspend 270 megawatts of power delivery to Edison International (EIX) utility Southern California Edison and sell on the open market, because SoCal Edison has not paid its bills since November. CalEnergy stopped supplying power to SoCal Ed immediately following the court ruling. ""We stopped supplying power at 1 PM (PST) and have been selling to parties that will pay since then....We are selling it to marketers; our current marketing agent is El Paso Corp (EPG) and they will sell it for us,"" Sokol said. Sokol added that while it was his company's intention to have its power sold to California, that could not be guaranteed. ""We leave the energy selling to El Paso....We've directed them that we would like the power to stay in California but we can't stop them,"" from selling out of state, Sokol said. Wholesale prices on the open market are about $400-$500 a megawatt-hour, three times more than what the company had received under its contract with SoCal Ed. The court's ruling did not address the $45 million SoCal Ed still owes CalEnergy for November and December power, and Sokol said that his company's separate lawsuit on that matter sought to attach the utility's assets as payment for that debt. Sokol said the court's ruling had ""significant implications"" for the entire community of small, independent generators, known as qualifying facilities or QFs, who have not received payment from SoCal Ed. ""Edison's own lawyer said it best....that every QF in the state will begin to mitigate if the judge allowed us (to sell on the open market),"" Sokol said. Sokol said his company was prepared to push SoCal Ed into involuntary bankruptcy Friday if CalEnergy hadn't won the case, but said he couldn't speculate whether other QFs may be more or less inclined to do so as a result of the court outcome. A group of renewable power suppliers, owed more than $100 million from SoCal Ed, said late Wednesday they want state lawmakers to release them for their supply contracts with PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric and SoCal Ed until the utilities are restored to financial stability. The utilities claim close to $13 billion in undercollections due to an inability to pass high wholesale power costs to customers under a rate freeze. In a statement, SoCal Ed said it opposed CalEnergy's bid to suspend its QF contract because the utility believed Gov. Gray Davis and state regulators are close to resolving ""very legitimate financial concerns of CalEnergy and other QF suppliers."" SoCal Ed said it was concerned that CalEnergy's request to sell to third parties would lead to a major supply shortage in California. The utility said it has informed the QFs that it is working to resolve the issue without giving unfair advantage to one class of creditors. While many of the state's large power suppliers have been paid by on a forward basis for the power they sell into California, the QFs, which make up one-third of the state's total power supply, haven't been paid by SoCal Ed since November. PG&E has made partial payments to its QFs. -By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872, jessica.berthold@dowjones.com (Jason Leopold contributed to this article.) California and the West Judge Frees Small Firm From Edison Contract KEN ELLINGWOOD; DAN MORAIN TIMES STAFF WRITERS 03/23/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition A-3 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company El CENTRO -- California's balance of electrical power shifted slightly Thursday when an Imperial County judge temporarily freed a small geothermal energy producer from its contract with Southern California Edison, allowing it to sell power on the open market. The ruling by Superior Court Judge Donal B. Donnelly could lead to a mass exodus by hundreds of small energy producers that have been selling power to the state's financially troubled utilities for months without getting paid. At the same time, it may have staved off plans by a group of the small generators to send Edison into involuntary bankruptcy as early as today. In Sacramento, energy legislation pushed by Gov. Gray Davis passed in the state Senate but foundered in the Assembly. The measure was intended to ensure that the state gets repaid for the electricity that it has been buying on behalf of Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric, which say they lack the cash and credit to purchase power. The bill also was supposed to guarantee that the small, alternative energy producers--which together provide nearly a third of the state's power--get paid. But Assembly Republicans opposed it, saying it hadn't been given sufficient scrutiny. The impact of the small producers was made clear in Imperial County, where Edison's failure to pay CalEnergy, the county's biggest property taxpayer, had outsize implications. CalEnergy had put county officials on notice that it was about to miss a $3.8-million property tax payment. The uncertainty had prompted the tiny Calipatria Unified School District to postpone a bond issue for badly needed school repairs. Among CalEnergy Chairman David Sokol's first acts after the judge's ruling Thursday was to promise Imperial County Supervisor Wally J. Leimgruber that the company would pay its property taxes on time. ""That is great news,"" Leimgruber said. Within hours of its court victory, CalEnergy had stopped transmitting geothermal power to Edison and begun selling it to El Paso Energy, a marketing company that purchased the energy at prevailing rates and resold it on the spot market. Some of the more than 700 other small energy producers in the state said they were considering similar action against Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric. ""We absolutely need the right to sell to third parties,"" said Dean Vanech, president of Delta Power, a New Jersey company that owns five small gas-fired plants in California and is owed tens of millions of dollars by Edison. Sokol praised the Imperial County judge and said his company simply wanted the authority to sell its power ""to a credit-worthy company that, in fact, pays for the power."" An Edison spokesman said the company was disappointed with the ruling, but sympathized with CalEnergy and other small producers because ""California's power crisis has placed [them] in financial distress, just as it has placed utilities in financial distress."" Edison expressed concern that the ruling would prompt CalEnergy and other small producers to sell their power out of state. Sokol said CalEnergy had specifically told El Paso Energy that it hoped its power would remain in California, ""but if someone wants to pay a higher price out of state, we can't stop them."" Sokol said that Edison still owes CalEnergy $140 million and that the company--along with seven other small producers--had been prepared to file a petition in federal bankruptcy court in Los Angeles today forcing the utility into involuntary bankruptcy. He said his company no longer intends to do so, and he believed--but wasn't certain--that the other companies would shelve their plans. Edison filed papers Thursday with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission showing that it owed $840 million to various small electricity producers, many of which rely on renewable energy sources such as geothermal steam, solar energy or wind. The alternative energy producers--and utilities--strenuously objected to the legislation considered in Sacramento on Thursday. The bill, spelling out how the utilities are to pay the state and the small producers, passed the Senate on a 27-9 vote, the exact two-thirds margin required. But it stalled in the Assembly on a 46-23 party-line vote, well short of two-thirds. ""When I was a citizen back in Lancaster, I heard these stories about pieces of legislation that were cooked up late at night, that . . . were cut and pasted together and were rammed through by the Legislature,"" Assemblyman George Runner (R-Lancaster) said. ""That's exactly what we have before us."" The alternative electricity generators, including oil companies, warned that they would lose money under the Davis proposal, while representatives of Edison and PG&E, which have amassed billions in debt in the worsening energy crisis, said the legislation would push them deeper into the hole. ""There isn't enough money,"" Edison attorney Ann Cohn testified at a Senate hearing on the bill Thursday. ""It is a very simple question: Dollars going out cannot be greater than dollars coming in."" The bill, AB 8X, combined several proposals. First, it sought to clarify earlier legislation by spelling out that Edison and PG&E must pay the state all money collected from consumers for electricity that the state has been buying. Additionally, the bill would turn over to the California Public Utilities Commission the thorny issue of how much to pay alternative energy producers for their electricity. Wind, solar and geothermal producers might agree to the prices offered by the administration. But most of the alternative energy producers, including Chevron and British Petroleum, use natural gas to generate electricity through ""cogeneration,"" a process of creating steam for both electric generation and heat. With natural gas prices high, they contend, they would lose money at the prices Davis is offering. * Ellingwood reported from El Centro, Morain from Sacramento. Times staff writers Mitchell Landsberg in Los Angeles and Jenifer Warren, Nancy Vogel and Carl Ingram in Sacramento contributed to this story. (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Power Points Background The state Legislature approved electricity deregulation with a unanimous vote in 1996. The move was expected to lower power bills in California by opening up the energy market to competition. Relatively few companies, however, entered that market to sell electricity, giving each that did considerable influence over the price. Meanwhile, demand has increased in recent years while no major power plants have been built. These factors combined last year to push up the wholesale cost of electricity. But the state's biggest utilities--Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison--are barred from increasing consumer rates. So the utilities have accumulated billions of dollars in debt and, despite help from the state, have struggled to buy enough electricity. * Daily Developments * Overcharges by major electricity suppliers were estimated at $6.3 billion, up from the $5.5 billion first thought, California's power grid operator said. * Electricity producers denied that they have profiteered and argued that Cal-ISO's figures don't take into account all their costs. * A Superior Court judge's ruling Thursday freeing a small producer from its contract with Edison could lead to a mass exodus by small energy producers that have been selling to the utilities without getting paid. * Verbatim ""If these guys have such high costs ... how come they're making so much money?"" --Gary Stern, Edison's director of market monitoring and analysis, referring to power producers Complete package and updates at www.latimes.com/power Grid Operator Says California Paid Too Much for Power By Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal 03/23/2001 The Wall Street Journal A2 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) California's electric-grid operator said power suppliers may have overcharged the state and its utilities by $6.2 billion, or a total of 30%, in a 10-month period, and has asked federal regulators to step up their policing of electricity markets. Meanwhile, a California state judge handed down a decision involving small power producers that could result in more electricity being made available in the energy-starved state, but likely at greater cost to the state government. The $6.2 billion figure was contained in a market analysis by the California Independent System Operator filed yesterday with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The ISO says it isn't seeking a refund -- for the May through February period -- because its analysis lacked important market data. For example, it estimated costs for 21 suppliers based on published prices for natural gas, not on specific data showing what each generator actually paid for the fuel. ""We don't know how much gas actually was purchased at spot-market prices,"" said Anjali Sheffrin, the ISO's head of market analysis. Charles Robinson, general counsel for the ISO, said FERC needs to become ""more aggressive about market-power mitigation."" The ISO's filing, he said, was intended to push the agency in that direction, since FERC is responsible for policing deregulated electricity and natural-gas markets. He said that if the FERC doesn't act, the state of California may find ways to discipline the market, such as through the state attorney general's office. The attorney general has been investigating the state's electricity market for many months but hasn't brought any court action. Dynegy Inc., a big owner of power plants in California, said it will provide additional information to FERC supporting its position that the prices it has charged for power have been ""just and reasonable."" The Houston company was one of 13 energy suppliers that the FERC this month ordered to pay refunds totaling $124 million or ""show cause"" why it should be excused. Dynegy said the FERC analysis was flawed, because it used ""inaccurate"" prices for natural gas and pollution credits. While big power producers such as Dynegy came under attack, small power producers won a potentially significant victory in a state court in Southern California's Imperial County. A judge granted 10 geothermal plants operated by the CalEnergy Co. unit of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co., a unit of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., of Omaha, Neb., permission to suspend deliveries of electricity to Southern California Edison Co. and instead seek other buyers. These plants, known as ""qualifying facilities,"" are under long-term contract to Edison and other utilities but haven't been paid for months. Edison, a unit of Edison International, of Rosemead, Calif., says it has been unable to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in power bills to CalEnergy and others because it has been driven to the brink of insolvency by the state's failed utility-deregulation plan. While the CalEnergy case involves only about 320 megawatts of power, the repercussions could be far greater. Collectively, hundreds of qualifying facilities, or QFs, produce as much as 30% of California's electricity needs. QFs totaling 3,000 megawatts cut their production in recent weeks for lack of payment. This loss of output was a significant cause of the blackouts that hit California this week. Observers believe the CalEnergy court decision could give other QFs an opportunity to sell power in the open market, presumably to the state government that now is California's biggest energy buyer. An hour after the court decision yesterday, some 400 megawatts of power came back into the market, the ISO said. However, additional QF power sales on the open market could substantially increase the state's tab. Already, the state has allocated more than $4 billion for electricity purchases. Separately, Edison said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that its unpaid power bills could contribute to a write-off of as much as $2.7 billion for 2000. Because of uncertainty caused by the energy crisis, the company hasn't yet reported year-end earnings. Power regulators debate who should be exempted from blackouts By KAREN GAUDETTE Associated Press Writer 03/22/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - State power regulators said Thursday they are working to exempt all California hospitals, regardless of size, from rolling blackouts. The Public Utilities Commission met with representatives from hospitals and investor-owned utilities after Los Angeles lawyer David Huard filed an emergency motion with the PUC on behalf of more than 500 hospitals throughout the state. Under PUC rules, hospitals with more than 100 beds are exempt from losing electricity during power emergencies. But during rolling blackouts Monday, at least a dozen hospitals from Long Beach to Clearlake were forced to use their backup generators. Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison Co. say they blacked out those hospitals specifically because they have backup generators. Both utilities said the temporary blackouts were part of their overall efforts to spread the burden of blackouts over more of their customers. Linda Ziegler, director of business and regulatory planning for SoCal Edison, said the utility is following state law and will implement new guidelines if the PUC changes them. But hospitals say there is a 10-second lapse before emergency generators kick in, which could harm patients in the midst of delicate surgical procedures such as organ transplants or brain surgery. ""You wouldn't fly a plane with only your emergency backup systems in place,"" said Ann Mosher, a spokeswoman for California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco. ""Backup generators are just that, they're not designed to keep the hospital up and running at full capacity."" Ziegler said that power still goes out for reasons beyond the energy crisis, from incidents like lightning or a knocked-down power pole. ""If it's a serious problem for the hospital it's certainly something they should be address just from an ongoing basis,"" she said. The exemption would cover all hospitals within the territory of the state's investor owned utilities PG&E, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric. Hospitals within the range of municipally owned utilities, such as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, are separately regulated. For more than two decades, prisons, hospitals with more than 100 beds and emergency services such as fire and police departments have been classified as ""essential"" services, and are exempted from blackouts by order of state power regulators. After rolling blackouts began darkening the state in January, many other public service groups began seeking relief from power interruptions, including transit systems, schools and water districts. --- On the Net: http://www.cpuc.ca.gov Federal Judge Orders Reliant To Keep Selling Pwr To Calif 03/22/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP)--A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction Wednesday ordering a major electricity wholesaler to continue selling to California despite its fear that it will not get paid. U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. said Californians were at risk of irreparable harm if Reliant Energy (REI) stopped selling power to the Independent System Operator, which oversees the state's power grid. The ISO buys last-minute power on behalf of utilities to fill gaps in supply. Damrell dismissed Reliant's attempt to force the state Department of Water Resources to back the ISO's purchases for the state's two biggest utilities. The state has been spending about $50 million a day on power for Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, both denied credit by suppliers after amassing billions of dollars in debts. The judge said he had no authority to force the DWR to pay for that power. Gov. Gray Davis has said the state isn't responsible for purchasing the costly last-minute power ISO buys for Edison and PG&E, despite a law authorizing state power purchases on the utilities' behalf. ISO attorney Charles Robinson said the ruling gives ISO operators ""a tool to assist them in keeping the lights on in California."" ""Had the decision gone the other way, one could expect other generators to simply ignore emergency orders,"" Robinson said. Damrell's preliminary injunction will remain in effect until the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rules on the matter. Damrell denied the ISO's request for preliminary injunctions against three other wholesalers - Dynegy Inc. (DYN), AES Corp. (AES) and Williams Cos. (WMB) - which agreed to continue selling to the ISO pending the FERC ruling. Spokesmen for Reliant, Dynegy, AES and Williams were out of the office Wednesday night and didn't immediately return calls from The Associated Press seeking comment on the ruling. The ISO went to court in February after a federal emergency order requiring the power sales expired. The judge then issued a temporary restraining order, requiring the sales, but dropped it after the suppliers agreed to continue sales to California pending his Wednesday ruling. The ISO said it would lose about 3,600 megawatts if the suppliers pulled out, enough power for about 2.7 million households. One megawatt is enough for roughly 750 homes. Grid officials said Reliant's share alone is about 3,000 megawatts. Reliant said the amount at issue actually is less than a fourth of that, because most of its output is already committed under long-term contracts. Reliant, which currently provides about 9% of the state's power, worries it won't get paid due to the financial troubles of PG&E and Edison. PG&E and Edison say that together they have lost about $13 billion since June due to soaring wholesale electricity costs that California's 1996 deregulation law bars them from passing onto customers. Calif Small Pwr Producers To Shut Plants If Rates Capped By Jason Leopold Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 03/22/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Many of California's independent power producers late Wednesday threatened to take their small power plants offline this week if state lawmakers pass legislation that would cap the rates the generators charge for electricity they sell directly to the state's three investor-owned utilities. At issue is a bill that would repeal a section of the state's Public Utilities Code, which links the 688 so-called qualifying facilities' electricity rates to the monthly border price of natural gas. Lawmakers, however, are poised to pass the legislation. State regulators are then expected to approve a measure that would restructure the fluctuating rates the QFs charge PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric, Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison, and Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric from $170 a megawatt-hour to $69-$79/MWh, regardless of the price of natural gas. Whereas each of the 688 QF contracts differed, largely because natural gas prices are higher in Southern California than Northern California, the state wants the QFs to sign a general contract with the utilities. The cogeneration facilities, which produce about 5,400 megawatts of electricity in the state, said the rates are too low and they won't sign new supply contracts with the utilities. ""For $79/MWh, natural gas would have to be $6 per million British thermal unit at the Southern California border,"" said Tom Lu, executive director of Carson-based Watson Cogeneration Company, the state's largest QF, generating 340 MW. ""Our current gas price at the border is $12.50."" Other gas-fired QFs said the state could face another round of rolling blackouts if lawmakers and state regulators pass the legislation, which is expected to be heard on the Senate floor Thursday, and allow it to be implemented by Public Utilities Commission next week. Lu, whose company is half-owned by BP Amoco PLC (BP) and is owed $100 million by SoCal Ed, said the proposals by the PUC and the Legislature ""will only make things worse."" David Fogarty, spokesman for Western States Petroleum Association, whose members supply California with more than 2,000 MW, said the utilities need to pay the QFs more than $1 billion for electricity that was already produced. State Loses 3,000 MW QF Output Due Of Financial Reasons The QFs represent about one-third, or 9,700 MW, of the state's total power supply. Roughly 5,400 MW are produced by natural gas-fired facilities. The rest is generated by wind, solar power and biomass. About 3,000 MW of gas-fired and renewable QF generation is offline in California because the power plant owners haven't been paid hundreds of millions of dollars from cash-strapped utilities SoCal Ed and PG&E for nearly four months. Several small power plant owners owed money by SoCal Ed have threatened to drag the utility into involuntary bankruptcy if the utility continues to default on payments and fails to agree to supply contracts at higher rates. The defaults have left many of the renewable and gas-fired QFs unable to operate their power plants because they can't afford to pay for the natural gas to run their units. Others continue to produce electricity under their contracts with the state's utilities but aren't being paid even on a forward basis. The California Independent System Operator, keeper of the state's electricity grid, said the loss of the QF generation was the primary reason rolling blackouts swept through the state Monday and Tuesday. Gov. Gray Davis, recognizing the potential disaster if additional QFs took their units offline, held marathon meetings with key lawmakers Monday and Tuesday to try and hammer out an agreement that would get the QFs paid on a forward basis and set rates of $79/MWh and $69/MWh for five and 10 year contracts. He also said he would direct the PUC to order the utilities to pay the QFs for power they sell going forward. ""After next week the QF problem will be behind us,"" Davis said Tuesday. ""We want to get the QFs paid...the QFs are dropping like flies...and when that happens the lights go out."" But this just makes the problem worse, said Assemblyman Dean Florez, D-Shafter, a member of the Assembly energy committee. ""I don't know how we are going to keep the lights on,"" Florez said in an interview. ""Many of these congenerators are in my district. They said if the legislation doesn't change they are going offline. This compounds the issue of rolling blackouts, especially now when we need every megawatt."" Davis, who didn't meet with people representing the QFs, said he was handing the QF issue to the PUC because lawmakers failed to pass legislation that would have set a five-year price for natural gas and allow the QFs to sign individual contracts with the utilities. In addition, SOCal Ed opposed the legislation, saying the rates should be below $50/MWh. Some renewable power producers said they aren't vehemently opposed to the new rate structure because it guarantees them a higher rate than what was originally proposed. QFs Want Third Party Supply Contracts John Wood, who represents the SoCal Ed Gas Fired Creditors Committee, one of a handful of groups that have formed since January to explore options on getting paid by the utilities, said his group of gas-fired QF creditors want to be released from their supply contracts and sell to third parties. ""Under our plan, we would be permitted to sell electricity to third parties (including the state Department of Water Resources) until a resolution to the crisis can be accomplished,"" wood said. Hal Dittmer, president of Sacramento-based Wellhead Electric in Sacramento, which is owed $8 million by PG&E, has 85 MW of gas-fired generation units offline. Under the state's plan, Dittmer said he risks going out of business. ""I can't buy natural gas for what I would be paid under this decision,"" he said. ""The state needs to quit kidding themselves that they don't need to raise electricity rates. All of this is being driven by an artificial construct that California can avoid raising rates."" -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; jason.leopold@dowjones.com Power Strain Eases but Concerns Mount Energy: Officials say summer prices will be high, and a state report shows that contracts with generators are far short of goals. DAN MORAIN; JENIFER WARREN TIMES STAFF WRITERS 03/22/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition A-3 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO -- California's fragile electricity system stabilized Wednesday, but a Davis administration report suggested troubles ahead because the state could be forced to buy most of its power for the coming summer on the costly and volatile spot market. After two days of statewide blackouts, power plants that had been shut down were cranked up. Unseasonable heat tapered off. The operators of the statewide power grid relaxed their state of emergency. But plenty of ominous signs remained. Many small producers remained shut down, skeptical about Gov. Gray Davis' plan for utilities to pay them. State Controller Kathleen Connell issued a sharp warning about the high cost of the state's foray into the power business and announced that she will block an administration request that she transfer $5.6 billion into an account that could be tapped to pay for state purchases of electricity. And a report from the administration summarizing contracts between Davis and independent power generators showed that the state has signed contracts for only 2,247 megawatts of electricity, significantly less than the 6,000 to 7,000 megawatts previously claimed. While there are agreements in principle for the full amount, the report notes that generators can back out of the contracts for a variety of reasons, including the state's failure to sell bonds to finance power purchased by July 1. The Legislature has approved plans to sell $10 billion in bonds, but none have yet been issued. ""We are exposed enormously this summer,"" Senate Energy Committee chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) said after looking at the report. ""We owe the people the truth about how difficult this summer is going to be. We don't have a power fairy."" Perhaps most significant, the report suggests that the contracts fall significantly short of Davis' stated goal of buying no more than 5% of the state's summer needs on the spot electricity market, where prices can be many times those of long-term contracts. After reading the report, Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who studies the California electricity market, said the numbers suggested that the state's long-term contracts will cover less than half of what the state will need this summer. ""We're definitely short this summer, next summer and the summer of 2003,"" he said. California was forced to start buying electricity in December--at a cost of $50 million a day--because producers refused to sell to Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric. The two utilities amassed billions of dollars in debt when prices for wholesale power soared on the spot market. Vikram Budhraja, a consultant retained by Davis to negotiate deals with generators, said the report represents a ""work in progress."" He said the state may yet sign new contracts. However, Wolak said the contract figures confirm what he and others have been dreading: that summer is going to be rife with rolling blackouts unless serious steps to cut demand are taken immediately. Wolak and other experts say large industrial customers must be switched to real-time meters and pricing to persuade them to use the bulk of their energy at times of low demand. The head of the Energy Foundation, a San Francisco-based nonprofit that promotes sustainable sources of power, made the same proposal to Davis on Wednesday. ""The government need not ask customers to swelter in the dark this summer,"" foundation President Hal Harvey argued in a letter. He also proposed a crash campaign to boost sales of efficient appliances and lightbulbs. He said the state needs to take over the utilities' contracts with alternative energy providers to ensure they stay in business, and sign new contracts for 1,500 megawatts of new wind power--the cheapest, fastest and cleanest source of new supply. Davis had proposed a formula Tuesday to force private utilities to pay the alternative producers, some of which have not been paid since November. But some of them warned Wednesday that Davis' plan offers them little incentive to turn on their generators. Alternative energy producers supply more than a quarter of the electricity consumed in California. Many producers generate electricity from wind, sun and geothermal sources. But most of them generate power using natural gas--and the cost of natural gas has been soaring. Several natural gas users said Davis' plan, which caps rates, won't cover their fuel costs. Davis assumes that the price of natural gas will fall. But small generators say they don't have sufficient purchasing power or sophistication to gamble on future prices. The Public Utilities Commission is expected to approve Davis' proposal next week. It offers producers two choices: 7.9 cents a kilowatt-hour if they agree to supply power for five years, or 6.9 cents a kilowatt-hour over 10 years. ""The price of natural gas is higher than that,"" said Marty Quinn, executive vice president and chief operating officer of Ridgewood Power LLC, which owns three natural gas-fired co-generation plants. ""If we operate, we'll lose money."" Ridgewood is not operating, having been cut off by gas suppliers. The company sued PG&E last month seeking overdue payments and release from its contracts with the utility. A hearing is scheduled in El Centro today in another lawsuit filed by a small energy producer, an Imperial Valley geothermal producer that sued Edison for refusing to let it break its contract and sell on the open market. CalEnergy says Edison owes it about $140 million for energy sold since November. A company spokesman, Jay Lawrence, said CalEnergy was going ahead with its suit despite Davis' proposal. ""We've had promises before,"" he said. In other developments: * A federal judge in Sacramento on Wednesday ordered Reliant Energy of Houston, a major producer, to continue selling power to California during emergencies, despite the company's argument that it may not be fully reimbursed. The order will remain in effect for 60 days or until the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decides a related case. * Connell said the state budget surplus has shrunk to $3.2 billion because the state has spent roughly $2.8 billion on electricity. She criticized the administration for withholding basic information about state finances, and said she will begin an audit on Monday of the Department of Water Resources, which is responsible for purchasing power. Davis' aides said Connell took her action because the Democratic governor endorsed one of Connell's foes this week in the race for Los Angeles mayor, former Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa. A Connell aide scoffed at the notion. * Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said she ""never has had a response"" from President Bush after writing him last month for an appointment to discuss the California energy crisis. In a wide-ranging lunch talk with reporters in Washington, she deplored the fact that ""huge, huge profits are being made"" in the California crisis, and said ""an appropriate federal role"" would be to guarantee a reliable source of power until the state can get nine new generators online. * Times staff writers Mitchell Landsberg in Los Angeles and Robert L. Jackson in Washington contributed to this report.

Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey), Senate Energy Committee chairwoman CPUC Must Address Rates In QF Repayment Order - SoCal Ed 03/21/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Any order from the California Public Utilities Commission requiring utilities to pay small, independent generators going forward must determine how that could be done within the existing rate structure, a spokesman for Edison International (EIX) utility Southern California Edison said Wednesday. The utility was responding to a PUC proposed decision that would require utilities to pay small generators, called qualifying facilities, $79 a megawatt hour within 15 days of electricity delivery. The decision will be voted March 27 by the CPUC. ""We're still reviewing (the decision) and should have more to say in a day or two. To the extent that the commission orders us to pay going forward of course we will. But it needs to address how we will pay the QFs,"" a SoCal Edison spokesman said. SoCal Edison and PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric Co. are struggling under nearly $13 billion in uncollected power costs due to an inability to pass high wholesale power costs to customers under a rate freeze. Gov. Gray Davis Tuesday blasted the utilities for not having paid their QF bills in full since December. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. has made some partial payments to QFs, but SoCal Edison has paid nothing. Together, they owe the QFs about $1 billion, but the order doesn't address that debt. An Edison executive said, in reaction to the governor's sharp comments, that the company simply doesn't have the money to pay creditors. ""The root problem here is there just isn't enough money in the current rate base to pay our bills,"" said Edison Senior Vice President of Public Affairs Bob Foster. ""We understand the financial distress (the QFs) face; we are facing financial distress ourselves."" The proposed PUC order would also require the state's investor-owned utilities to offer the small generators five- and 10-year contracts for power for $79/MWh and $69/MWh, respectively. The QFs ""may be able to live with"" the PUC proposal, but the five- and 10-year contract prices may be inadequate if natural gas prices at one of the California borders are high, said Jan Smutny-Jones, president of the Independent Energy Producers Association. Natural gas prices into California are currently higher than anywhere in the country. But some say the proposed decision may not be enough to prevent the QFs from filing involuntary bankruptcy proceedings against the utilities for the money they are still owed. ""There's still a lot of skepticism. To say our position has changed based on the CPUC decision or the governor's announcement is not accurate. A lot still has to happen,"" said Jay Lawrence, a spokesman for a renewable creditors committee. -By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872; jessica.berthold@dowjones.com -0- 22/03/01 01-27G State Says It's Accelerating Plan to Buy Power Utilities' Grid Government: Talks with Edison are reported near completion, but agreement with heavily indebted PG&E has a way to go. RONE TEMPEST; DAN MORAIN TIMES STAFF WRITERS 03/21/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition A-22 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO -- As blackouts hit California for a second day Tuesday, a key consultant to Gov. Gray Davis said negotiations to buy the power grid owned by the state's largest utilities ""are proceeding at an accelerated pace."" Wall Street consultant Joseph Fichera said talks with Southern California Edison could be wrapped up within days, although those with PG&E are much less advanced. The administration and PG&E have not reached even an agreement in principle, he said. PG&E, which has more debt than Edison, says its transmission lines are more extensive than those of its Southern California counterpart. The state wants to buy the utilities' transmission lines and other assets for about $7 billion to provide cash to the utilities, help stabilize the electricity supply and ease the power crunch that has plagued California for months. To research the grid purchase, Fichera said, the state has had to pore over 80,000 documents just to assess the utilities' liabilities. ""We are working at a good pace,"" said Fichera, chief executive of the New York firm Saber Partners. "" . . . If we get to a deal-breaker, it might be longer."" By making Fichera, who is also a consultant to the Texas Public Utilities Commission, available to reporters Tuesday, the Davis administration was clearly trying to reassure the public that progress is being made on the governor's plan to pull the state out of the crisis. Since mid-January, when the big utilities' credit failed and suppliers stopped selling to them, the state has spent nearly $3 billion buying electricity from a handful of large suppliers in Texas, Oklahoma, Georgia and North Carolina. Not a cent has gone to the hundreds of alternative energy suppliers in California who provide about a quarter of the state's electricity. The Monday and Tuesday blackouts occurred partly because many of the cash-strapped alternative suppliers, including solar, biomass and wind power units, cut their normal supply to the system in half. They say Edison and PG&E have not paid them since November; the utilities say they are out of cash. Assemblyman Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek) said the plight of the alternative suppliers has dragged on because of the complexity of dealing with ""almost 700 individual contractors."" Another delaying factor, said Keeley, who with state Sen. Jim Battin (R-La Quinta) worked for almost three months to come up with a legislative plan to lower the small producers' prices, was ""the huge enmity . . . manifested between the utilities and the qualifying facilities. These people just don't like each other."" This week's blackouts provided two painful lessons for the Davis administration: * When it comes to electricity, size doesn't matter--every kilowatt counts. During peak use, a small wind power facility in Riverside County can make the difference between full power and blackouts. * There is no such thing as a partial solution. Unless the whole energy equation is balanced, the parts don't work. For the Davis plan to work, several key elements need to come together or utility customers will almost certainly face rate increases above the 19% already set in motion * The cost of power purchased by the state must be reduced through long-term contracts with the big out-of-state producers. These contracts, the details of which the Davis administration has kept confidential, are still being negotiated by Davis consultant Vikram Budhraja of the Pasadena firm Electric Power Group. The administration says it has concluded 40 contracts with generators, about half of which have been signed. According to the most recent statistics released by the Department of Water Resources, which buys power for the state, current prices are still well above the rate state Treasurer Phil Angelides says is necessary for a planned $10-billion bond offering to succeed. The bonds, set for sale in May, will be used to reimburse the state for the money it will have spent by that time to buy electricity. The state is currently spending at a rate of $58 million a day to buy power. If prices stay high, the $10 billion in bonds will not cover the state's power purchases by the end of the summer. Angelides says he cannot proceed with bridge financing for the bonds until the Public Utilities Commission devises a formula to guarantee that a portion of utility bills will be dedicated to bond repayment. Angelides has estimated that, under the January law that put the state in the power buying business, the state must be reimbursed $2.5 billion annually, and that $1.3 billion is needed to service the debt. PUC Administrative Law Judge Joseph R. DeUlloa is expected to announce his ruling on the reimbursement rate later this week, leading to a PUC vote on the matter as early as next week. * The rates charged for electricity by the alternative producers, known as qualifying facilities, must be cut at least in half, down from an average of more than 17 cents per kilowatt-hour. In his news conference Tuesday, Davis said he will ask the PUC to set QF rates at 6.9 cents for 10-year contracts and 7.5 cents for five-year contracts. Meanwhile, PUC Chairman Loretta Lynch, a Davis appointee, said Tuesday that the commission will vote next week on a proposed order requiring Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric to pay the QFs for electricity in the future. Lynch said a recent PUC assessment showed that the utilities have enough cash on hand for that. ""We are trying to make sure the folks providing the power get paid,"" Lynch said. ""The qualified facilities have demonstrated that they haven't been paid and that it is impairing their ability to provide power."" The utilities contend that if they pay the small providers what they owe them, there will not be enough money left to pay other creditors. ""There is not enough money in the current rate structure to pay the [alternative producers], pay the [Department of Water Resources] and pay the utilities for their generation,"" said John Nelson, a spokesman for PG&E. * The utilities must sell to the state the power they produce themselves, mainly from hydro and nuclear sources, at a rate only slightly above the cost of producing it. This is tied to the ongoing negotiations between the Davis administration and the utilities to restore the near-bankrupt utilities to solvency. * Times staff writers Julie Tamaki, Miguel Bustillo and Tim Reiterman contributed to this report. Davis OKs Subsidy of Pollution Fees Smog: As part of secret deal to get long-term energy contracts, state would pay for some of the credits that allow excess power plant emissions. Critics renew call for full disclosure. DAN MORAIN TIMES STAFF WRITER 03/21/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition A-23 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO -- As part of his closed-door negotiations to buy electricity, Gov. Gray Davis has agreed to relieve some generators from having to pay potentially millions of dollars in fees for emitting pollutants into the air, Davis said Tuesday. Davis announced two weeks ago that his negotiators had reached deals with 20 generators to supply $43 billion worth of power during the next 10 years. However, the Democratic governor has refused to release any of the contracts or detail various terms, contending that release of such information would hamper the state's ability to negotiate deals with other generators and therefore ultimately would raise prices Californians pay for electricity. Sources familiar with the negotiations, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the agreement reached with Dynegy Inc., a power company based in Houston, is one that includes language requiring that the state pay the cost of credits that allow emissions. Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel declined to discuss the company's deal with the state. ""We couldn't get them to sign contracts; it was a sticking point,"" Davis said of the decision to pay the fees of some generators. ""We had to lock down some power so we were not totally dependent on the spot market."" The fees in question are part of an emission trading system known as RECLAIM. Under the system, companies are allotted a certain amount of allowable pollution. If their operations pollute more, companies are required to purchase credits on an open market. Currently the credits cost about $45 per pound of pollution--an amount that can lead to a bill of well over $10 million a year for a power plant. The South Coast Air Quality Management District, which regulates pollution in the Los Angeles Basin, is considering steps to significantly lower the cost of the system--a step that could considerably cut the state's potential cost, Davis said. Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) defended the decision to cover the power company's costs. ""It is a question of whether it brings down the price of power,"" she said. ""If it brings down the price of power, I don't have a problem with it."" Nevertheless, word that the contracts could bind the state to pay pollution fees caused some critics of Davis' policy to renew calls for Davis to reconsider the secrecy surrounding the power negotiations. The payment provision underscores the fact that the contracts involve more than merely the prices the state will pay for its megawatts, the critics note. ""The Legislature should have known about it,"" said Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco). ""It is going to cost taxpayers money. It makes you wonder. . . . This was a policy issue that was never discussed with the Legislature."" V. John White, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club, who also represents alternative energy producers, called the contract proposal ""a horrible precedent."" ""Until we know exactly what the state has agreed to and how much of a subsidy this represents, we can't determine how serious the breach of principle this is,"" White said. Another critic of the secrecy of the negotiations, Terry Francke, general counsel for the California First Amendment Coalition, said the provision in question ""raises the possibility that there are other [concessions]"" that have not yet come to light. In the summer, when demand for power is highest, some generators probably will exceed pollution limits set by regional air quality management districts. To avert blackouts, state officials might ask the companies to keep plants running. In such cases, some sources familiar with aspects of the contracts said, the contract language could be interpreted to suggest that the state would cover any fines--although Davis said Tuesday the state will not cover the cost of fines. A recent Dynegy filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission underscores the rising cost of pollution-related measures. The company, which is partners with NRG Energy in three California plants in El Segundo, Long Beach and Carlsbad in San Diego County, said its ""aggregate expenditures for compliance with laws related to the regulation of discharge of materials into the environment"" rose to $14.3 million in 2000, from $3.6 million in 1999. A South Coast Air Quality Management spokesman said Dynegy's facilities appear to be fairly clean--although Sierra Club lobbyist White said Dynegy has been seeking a permit at one of its plants to burn fuel oil, which is dirtier than natural gas. Davis said he intends to ""make this information public,"" but he added that ""we do not want to put the public's interest in jeopardy by asking them to pay higher prices."" ""Nobody likes the notion that [the administration is] not being fully forthcoming,"" Davis said. ""But I also have a corollary responsibility that I don't stick these generators with a higher rate."" FERC ORDERS WILLIAMS ENERGY AND AES TO EXPLAIN THEIR REFUSAL TO MAKE CERTAIN RMR UNITS AVAILABLE TO CALIFORNIA ISO LAST YEAR 03/21/2001 Foster Electric Report 5 (c) Copyright 2001, Foster Associates, Inc. Following a preliminary, non-public investigation, FERC directed AES Southland Inc. and Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Co. (IN01-3) on March 14 to show cause why they did not violate section 205 of the Federal Power Act (FPA) by failing to provide power to the California ISO from two reliability must-run (RMR) generator units during a period in April and May 2000. The investigation responded to a matter referred by the Cal-ISO. If a violation is found, Williams Energy and AES could be required to refund excess profits of $10.9 million (as calculated by FERC) and face restrictions on their market-based rate authority for a year. The show cause order involves two generation units (Alamitos 4 and Huntington Beach 2), owned and operated by AES. Williams Energy markets all output from the Alamitos and Huntington Beach plants, including the two units at issue here, pursuant to a tolling agreement filed with the Commission. The Cal-ISO designated the two units as RMR units that it could call on when necessary to provide energy and ancillary service essential to the reliability of the California transmission network. The Cal-ISO makes both a fixed payment to the RMR owner or operator to compensate for the RMR unit's availability and a variable payment for the RMR unit's output (if the unit is not otherwise participating in the market). Williams Energy and the Cal-ISO executed RMR agreements, filed as rate schedules with the Commission, allowing the Cal-ISO to dispatch units ""solely for purposes of meeting local reliability needs or managing intra-zonal congestion."" The ISO may dispatch a non-RMR unit if the designated RMR unit is not available. Under its RMR agreement with the ISO, Williams is paid the greater of its contract price or marginal cost for operating RMR units. However, if a non-RMR unit has to be dispatched because a designated RMR unit is unavailable, Williams will be paid its bid price, not the RMR contract price. During the April to May 2000 period, the Cal-ISO sought to dispatch both Alamitos 4 and Huntington Beach 2 as RMR units to provide voltage support. However, according to the FERC order, Williams Energy refused to make Alamitos 4 available from April 25 through May 5, and to make Huntington Beach 2 available from May 6 through May 11, ""for reasons not directly related to the necessary and timely maintenance of the units."" Consequently, the Cal-ISO was forced to dispatch non-RMR units at a higher cost, namely, Williams Energy's bid price for service provided by the replacement units. By contrast, if the RMR units had not experienced outages and been available from April 25 through May 11, Williams Energy would have received either (1) the market revenues only from the respective units, which would have resulted in no payments for RMR output from the ISO to Williams Energy, or (2) Williams Energy's variable cost for operating the RMR units less the market revenues from the respective units' output. Accordingly, FERC observed, Williams Energy had ""a financial incentive to prolong any outages of Alamitos 4 and Huntington Beach 2 in April and May 2000."" The bid price for the non-RMR units was at or near the Cal-ISO's then-effective bid cap of $750/MWh, FERC continued. Therefore, Williams Energy received payments from the Cal-ISO of more than $11.3 million, or about $10.3 million greater than the estimated average variable operating cost of the non-RMR units (approximately $63/MWh) during the period in question. This indicates a refund amount, including interest, of nearly $10.9 million. The information in this order and a non-public appendix, the Commission declared, suggests that AES declared outages at the two RMR units and maintained Huntington Beach 2 in a manner inconsistent with good utility practice, and that Williams Energy took action to extend the outage at Alamitos 4 and to make Huntington Beach 2 unavailable for ""pretextual reasons."" Based on this information coupled with Williams Energy's financial incentive not to make the Alamitos 4 and Huntington Beach 2 units available, FERC found serious questions about whether (1) AES and Williams Energy violated applicable RMR contracts and tariffs on file with the Commission pursuant to FPA section 205 when they refused to make Alamitos 4 and Huntington Beach 2 available for dispatch by the Cal-ISO; (2) whether Williams acted inconsistently with its market-based rate authority and the market monitoring information protocols of the Cal-ISO's tariff regarding the unavailability of the RMR units during the period at issue; and (3) whether AES violated a tolling agreement on file with the Commission pursuant to section 205. The Commission identified two remedies for these potential violations: a refund by Williams Energy and/or AES of revenues received greater than the amount that would have collected from the ISO if the RMR units had been available, and a condition on Williams Energy's market-based rate authority. Specifically, for a one-year period, if an RMR unit were not available when dispatched by the Cal-ISO, a non-RMR unit dispatched in its place would only receive payment according to the terms of the applicable RMR contract. In other words, Williams Energy would not receive the bid price for operation of the substitute, non- RMR unit. The Commission directed Williams Energy and AES to show cause, within 20 days, why they should not be found to have committed the above-described violations and why the specified remedies should not be imposed. Further, to ensure procurement of all relevant information, the Commission instituted a formal, non-public investigation into the operation, maintenance and sales of power from the Alamitos and Huntington Beach plants in 2000 and 2001. Calif Consumers Failing To Conserve Pwr Despite Blackouts 03/20/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- California consumers haven't been conserving enough electricity to relieve strain on the power grid and reduce demand in the state, a spokesman with the Independent System Operator said Tuesday. The ISO said that despite two straight days of statewide rolling blackouts, consumers aren't using less electricity, which means additional megawatts will be taken off the grid. As a result, blackouts could last longer and impact additional communities, the ISO said. ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said Monday ""conservation in California is no longer an option,"" but consumers in the state aren't heeding the call to reduce consumption. Conservation efforts during rolling blackouts Monday and Tuesday were far less than Jan. 17 and Jan. 18, when blackouts swept through Northern California due to transmission constraints. Jim Detmers, the ISO's vice president of operation, said consumers saved the state about 1,000 megawatts of electricity, enough power for 1 million houses. The ISO said conservation efforts Monday were about 500 MW or less. ""We would be very happy if we saw the same amount this time,"" Detmers said. The state's Energy Commission said consumers think it's no longer important to save electricity until blackouts are imposed. ""People have been saving generally, but it isn't a big bump from hour to hour,"" a spokesman for the Energy Commission said. Gov. Gray Davis launched a massive conservation campaign this month, promising consumers a rebate on their summer electricity bill if they save at least 20% of electricity, compared with last summer. The governor said he believes conservation this summer will amount to possibly saving 5,000 MW and averting the chance of rolling blackouts. -By Jason Leopold; Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; jason.leopold@dowjones.com Gas Co.'s Success Opens Debate Southern California energy supplier has reaped millions of dollars in state incentives for keeping down its costs. Though consumers get a share of the windfall, regulators are asking whether they should get more of the bonus, which is expected to be huge this year, as a form of price relief. The natural gas provider says it deserves to keep its reward. TIM REITERMAN TIMES STAFF WRITER 03/18/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition C-1 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company SAN FRANCISCO -- While consumers suffer soaring energy bills and the big electric utilities lurch toward insolvency, the news is not all dire at Southern California Gas Co. Through vigorous deal making, the Sempra Energy subsidiary has consistently beaten the volatile natural gas market during the last year, and the company stands to reap millions of dollars in savings through a state incentive program that rewards utilities for keeping costs down. For several years, the utility has been splitting the savings 50-50 with ratepayers whenever the company's gas costs fall slightly below market levels. Those savings, Gas Co. executives acknowledged, have shot to unprecedented heights during the state's power crisis. Now, in this climate of high consumer gas bills and runaway market prices, regulators are taking another look at the program. The question before the Public Utilities Commission: Should Gas Co. ratepayers, who endured huge bill increases this winter, get a bigger share of the savings? The total windfall under the incentive program has in some years exceeded $20 million. But the amount for the last 12 months is expected to multiply many times over, company executives said, partly because the Gas Co. has done so well in the wild market by selling, lending and trading gas as well as buying it. ""The recent market conditions . . . could possibly result in some unintended consequences that result in shared savings of benefits that may be more appropriately allocated entirely to ratepayers,"" the PUC's consumer protection arm, the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, reported Oct. 30, even before the latest upward market spirals. Gas Co. representatives express frustration, saying they have done what the state has requested under its gas-cost incentive program: Buy smarter, and pass the savings along to its 5 million residential and small-business customers. The company contends it has worked hard to keep bills down and should be rewarded for taking risks to obtain gas at the lowest possible cost. ""The PUC, every time we do well, raises the bar on us,"" said Jim Harrigan, director of gas acquisition. ""I don't necessarily agree with it."" By virtue of its purchasing power and storage and pipeline capacity, the Gas Co. has become a big player in the regional natural gas market. In the company's bustling trading room at its Los Angeles headquarters, 15 employees track price movements, pipeline supplies and even the weather via computer, while cutting deals and arranging gas shipments. Although the Gas Co. buys the commodity for its customers, the company also sells to marketers, other utilities and producers. State officials say the number of transactions by the company has risen steeply to 10,000 to 20,000 a year, including gas sales along California's border, where prices have rocketed. The PUC created the cost incentive program for the state's three major gas utilities--San Diego Gas & Electric Co. in 1993, Southern California Gas the next year and PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric Co. in 1997. Like Southern California Gas, SDG&E is a subsidiary of Sempra Energy. The program was designed to give utilities added motivation for obtaining gas at the best price for customers. It replaced lengthy and contentious reviews by the PUC, which assessed whether utilities had purchased gas at reasonable prices and sometimes ordered them to return millions of dollars to customers. An annual audit of the Gas Co. program and a staff evaluation requested by the PUC recently concluded that the program has achieved many of its goals, but it also proposed adjustments that would give customers a greater share of the rewards. ""These incentives were designed in less volatile times,"" said program supervisor Mark Pocta of the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, which conducted the audit. ""There is a question of how much should go to ratepayers and shareholders."" His office also plans to assess whether the Gas Co.'s trading had any negative effects on the gas market, resulting in diminished supplies or higher prices for other utilities and their customers. Under the program, the Gas Co. shares risks and rewards with its ratepayers, but since the program was launched, it has consistently produced awards. If the cost of gas is 0.5% or more below a benchmark based on monthly gas market indexes, the company and its customers split the savings 50-50. California's gas utilities are not allowed to profit on their raw commodity costs; they merely pass along those costs to ratepayers with no markup. The savings under the incentive program are automatically reflected in consumers' monthly gas bills but are not itemized. At the end of the year, the utilities request their share of the savings, and the PUC has routinely granted approval. Then the companies, and thus their shareholders, are paid through customer utility bills. The resulting bill increases typically have been modest, less than 1%. But as the awards increase, regulators say, the effect on customers will become more significant unless the present structure is changed. ""There's no question, when you start to talk about $100 million [or more in savings], and add [the company's award] into rates in a year, it will make a noticeable difference,"" said Los Angeles economist Jeff Leitzinger, president of Econ One, who has done consulting for the Gas Co. Still, he said, ratepayers should bear in mind that they already benefit from below-market gas and transportation costs. In the early years of the program, records show, the Gas Co.'s awards went from zero to $3.2 million, $10.6 million, $2 million and $7.7 million. Last year's award of $9.8 million is awaiting PUC approval. This year's proposed award, covering the period through the end of this month, has not yet been submitted by the Gas Co. But the utility has provided monthly figures and oral updates on a confidential basis to PUC officials, who declined to provide figures. Harrigan of the Gas Co. said the savings are expected to multiply ""many times over,"" largely because the company was well-equipped for the market fluctuations and tried to insulate its customers from high gas prices. ""Any trading company, especially one with assets like we have, has benefited from volatility in the market,"" he said. Harrigan said, however, that he does not believe the company's level of activity has adversely affected the market and that its trading pales in volume to that of unregulated energy companies. Anne Smith, the Gas Co.'s vice president of customer service and marketing, said the utility will not release figures for this year's incentive program until they are filed with the PUC in June. ""I don't want to interrupt that process,"" Smith said, noting that the PUC ultimately will determine the company's award. ""I think they need to focus on what [the Gas Co.] has done for the ratepayers. It has been immense."" Although the typical monthly gas bill has risen to $80 from $50 a year ago, Gas Co. customers tend to have lower rates than those of other California utilities. The company's gas procurement cost in February was 66 cents per therm, or 100 cubic feet. That's more than twice last year's cost but only about half what sister company SDG&E paid for its 740,000 customers in February. It's also much lower than the $1.09 per therm PG&E pays. ""We were as upset about the overall [gas price] increase as anyone else,"" Harrigan said. ""I would rather see the prices of a year ago, even though we managed to do a little better in the [recent] environment."" When it comes to keeping down costs, regulators say, the Gas Co. has advantages over other utilities in the marketplace. For one, the company has so much pipeline capacity at major gas basins that it purchases a relatively small portion of its needs--about 10% to 15%--at the California border, where prices in December briefly rose to the equivalent of $6 per therm, or 20 times those a year earlier. This presents opportunities. ""At the beginning of the month, they forecast a certain amount of gas they have to buy,"" said Pocta of the Office of Ratepayer Advocates. ""If they go out and buy and do not need to use as much because the weather is more moderate than expected, they can either inject the gas into storage or they can make sales at the border."" With gas price run-ups like those seen in the last year, Pocta said, ""there is a question: Should that benefit be shared, or flow entirely to ratepayers?"" Customers, he pointed out, may be entitled to additional benefits because they pay for the interstate and intrastate pipeline capacity and the gas storage that give the company the flexibility to make advantageous deals. ""By the same token, we want [the Gas Co.] . . . to go into the market and generate cost savings that can be passed on to the customers,"" he added. ""We want them to have incentives. The question is how to balance them."" Under deregulation, the Gas Co. adopted the nontraditional role of marketer, according to a PUC Energy Division report in January. The company makes gas sales at various locations. It engages in exchanges. It makes futures transactions to help stabilize costs. ""They look for ways to lower the gas cost,"" said Richard Myers, program supervisor at the Energy Division. ""Before they were lots more risk-averse. Now they feel they can take risks and make money for shareholders, and it is a benefit for ratepayers at the same time."" The incentive programs are tailored to individual utilities, so it is difficult to compare them. Records show that the shared savings at SDG&E, a much smaller utility, declined steadily from $9.2 million in the 1996-97 cycle to $560,000 in 1999-2000. Spokesman Ed Van Herik said the falloff largely represents a drop in gas purchases, especially as the company sold off its own gas-fired electricity-generating plants. He said the company does not yet know how much savings have accrued in the last year. In an annual report to the PUC in February, PG&E said it had no savings under the incentive program and thus it is not entitled to any award for the 1999-2000 cycle. The Utility Reform Network, a San Francisco-based consumer advocacy group, said it will closely watch the PUC's evaluation of the incentive program at the Gas Co. ""We want to make sure, given the dramatic changes in the gas market and prices, ratepayers are not left out of the [additional] benefits,"" TURN attorney Marcel Hawiger said. ""We'll look to see whether the mechanism should be changed."" Severin Borenstein, director of the Energy Institute at UC Berkeley, said the program should be changed to provide more incentive for utilities to enter long-term contracts that would smooth out volatility in the market. ""Unfortunately, under the system,"" he said, ""the only incentive is to beat the [spot] market.""

Delivering the keynote address at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's national energy summit in Washington Monday, Abraham said, ""California is not the only state facing a mismatch between supply and demand,"" what with ""electricity shortages predicted for New York City and Long Island this summer"" and low capacity margins threatening electricity reliability elsewhere across the country. But how likely is it that New Yorkers will face blackouts of the sort confronting Californians? Not very, says energy trade specialist Edward Krapels, managing director of Boston-based METIS Trading Advisors. Krapels, a consultant helping major Northeastern utilities, such as Consolidated Edison, design market-hedging programs, adamantly decried what he said are facile comparisons between conditions in New York and California, there being ""more differences than there are similarities"" between those two industrial cornerstones of the country's economy in respect to energy security management. ""First of all, New York has a more varied portfolio of energy generation sources than California,"" he said. California has hydro, nuclear and gas, but when it lost a lot of hydro, the state needed gas to pick up the slack, and the ""capacity just wasn't there."" In New York's case, the state has oil and coal still in the mix and its overall dependence on gas is much lower than California's, Krapels added. New York avoids making same mistakes Portfolio diversity is one pillar of any effective plan to help New York avoid the same errors made in redesigning California's marketplace. New York's Independent System Operator (ISO), in a new report warning that the state is at an ""energy crossroads"" in terms of its capacity adequacy in the immediate future, argues that a concerted effort is required to arrest declining in-state generation capacity reserve margins, and a strategy must be put in place, whether or not new generation comes on-line, in accordance with current anticipated scenarios. A measure of New York's essential difficulty is that, between 1995 and 2000, statewide demand for electricity grew 2,700 MW, while generating capacity expanded by only 1,060 MW. With no major new generating plants in downstate New York fully approved, the gap is expected to continue to widen. To avoid ""a replication of California's market meltdown"" the New York ISO calculates the state's daily generating capacity needs to grow by 8,600 MW by 2005, with more than half of that located in New York City and on Long Island. Expressing concern this may be too big a burden for the current bureaucratic process to bear, the ISO wants to see a state-appointed ombudsman named to help would-be merchant power plant investors plow through red tape. ""Increasing New York's generating capacity will also lessen the state's escalating and risky reliance on out-of-state sources of electricity,"" the ISO added. ""Since 1999, New York State has been unable to cover its reserve requirements from in-state sources."" Not everyone agrees with that analysis, insofar as it argues for circling the wagons inward. Some analysts believe the ultimate solution lies not in tying in more inwardly dedicated power, but in expanding the marketplace by breaking down inter-jurisdictional barriers. In any case, New York energy regulatory authorities and those responsible elsewhere in the U.S. Northeast, such as PJM (Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland) Interconnection and the New England Power Pool, are in vastly better shape in terms of ""cross-border"" cooperation than California and its neighbors in that efforts are being made among various authorities toward developing an integrated regional electricity market. In California, by contrast, the state's focus?for example, in the case of new gas-fired power plant development?has been to ensure dedicated supply to the California market alone, rather than on a regional marketplace. (Embedded image moved to file: pic05075.pcx) The New York ISO's new broad-based analysis of market-restructuring needs argues that the relatively stronger health of its reformed environment is ""due in large part to the ability of New York's utilities to enter into long-term power contracts."" What needs to be done most, it says, is to move aggressively to build some of the more than 29,000 MW of ""proposed new generation in the siting pipeline."" In the meantime, the 30,200 MW of electricity New Yorkers used on a peak day last summer shouldn't be eclipsed on too many days this coming summer (given early long-range weather forecasts). Demand, however, is expected to increase at an annual average rate of up to 1.4%. So while New York City, the rest of the state and adjacent parts might breathe easy this year, it could be a brief rest from the fray. Meanwhile, a 4% shortfall is still being planned for this summer that is not yet provided for, as authorities hurriedly seek to arrange new generation plants around Manhattan, on Long Island and even on barges offshore. One way or another, whether it is the weather or the politics of siting new energy facilities, it's going to be a hot time in the city. Long-term solutions hit brick wall Meanwhile, attempts at longer-term solutions continue to run into trouble. Last week, Connecticut state regulators came out against a proposal to run a new underwater cable under Long Island Sound that Hydro-Quebec subsidiary TransEnergie U.S. Ltd. wants to build to pump more juice into Long Island Power Authority's load pocket. Despite strong promises from TransEnergie to be diligent in avoiding damage to oyster beds in Long Island Sound, the proposal failed to convince authorities, who were persuaded the pipeline project could lead to diversion of electricity from Connecticut. In similar fashion, private companies wanting to build 10 small independent power plants and temporary generators offshore New York City are running into intense opposition from environmental groups and citizen orga nizations?some of whom have taken their cases to the state assembly in Albany. The David vs. Goliath nature of such controversies has further alerted energy companies to the difficulties of addressing complex energy supply issues that may ultimately devolve to people not wanting things in their backyard, regardless of what the alternative might mean to their fellow citizens or the greater public good. But suddenly, in New York, California's troubles?while still distant in their intensity? may not be so far away. By some estimates, this summer's bills for Consolidated Edison customers could be up as much as one third or more over last year's charges. Letting the time slip when it comes to building new infrastructure isn't going to make the pain go away. NEW YORK: NY-ISO REPORT SAYS STATE NEEDS 4,000 - 5,000 MW OF NEW GENERATION SOON TO AVOID SEVERE SHORTAGES; NY-ISO ALSO ASKS FERC TO EXTEND BID CAP AND TEMPORARY EMERGENCY PROCEDURES 03/21/2001 Foster Electric Report 2 (c) Copyright 2001, Foster Associates, Inc. Raising the specter of an East Coast version of the California crisis, the New York Independent System Operator, Inc. (NY-ISO) is warning of serious electricity shortages, air quality deterioration and stunted economic growth without immediate approval of between 4,000-5,000 MW of new generating capacity in the state. Of this amount, 2,000-3,000 MW is needed to serve New York City. Another 8,600 MW of new capacity will have to be built by 2005, the NY-ISO said in a recent report, Power Alert: New York's Energy Crossroads. ""New York is heading towards a very serious situation unless it acts immediately to get new supply sited within its borders,"" said NY-ISO president William Museler in a statement accompanying the report. ""This report is essentially a caution light at New York's energy crossroads."" Sources in the New York Public Service Commission have downplayed the NY-ISO's warning, asserting that a process for bringing on new generation is well underway, with more than 85 projects in the approval pipeline. In a related development, the NY-ISO asked FERC to approve a proposed tariff amendment (ER01-1517) extending existing bids caps in some of its markets until 10/31/02, and a separate and related amendment (ER01-1489) extending the NY-ISO's so-called temporary extraordinary procedures (TEP) that allow the ISO to make price adjustments and take other corrective actions if it finds evidence of market power abuse. The NY-ISO Report --The NY-ISO likened the situation in New York to that faced by California, where a relentless increase in demand has not been met with an equal increase in supply. The NY-ISO said that between 1995 and 2000, statewide demand for electricity rose by 2,700 MW, while generating capacity increased by only 1,060 MW. With no major new generating plants in downstate New York fully approved for construction at this time and generation demand in the state expected to grow around 1.3 percent annually for the next several years, the NY-ISO said this gap will continue to widen. The inevitable result of this trend is large rate increases for New York's power consumers. The NY-ISO's modeling suggests that ""by 2005, statewide prices are likely to be more than 20-25 percent lower in the case in which new plants are built than in the case where they are not."" In New York City, ""the price to consumers of electric power could be reduced by as much as 28 percent when compared to the case of no new supply or load management programs."" Besides large rate increases, the NY-ISO asserted that a failure to site and build new plants in New York will threaten power reliability in the state and lead to increasing reliance on out-of-state resources. The report said that if no new in-state generation comes on line in the next five years, the state's generation reserve margins will shrink from the current 14.9 percent above peak demand ""to a dangerously low 8.4 percent by 2005."" Pointing to California's situation, the report added that increased reliance on power imports ""can subject electrical suppliers and customers in New York to transmission restrictions and political and economic considerations beyond the control or influence of responsible New York State entities."" To avoid these harsh consequences, the NY-ISO said New York's new siting law, known as the Article X process, needs to be modified. Since the law was passed 18 months ago, the report noted that only two plants have been approved (both upstate) and neither has yet been built. The problem, according to the NY-ISO, is that the siting process ""requires the cooperation of multiple state agencies."" To expedite the process, the report suggested the ""clear designation of a lead agency and the adoption of an `ombudsman program' to expedite and coordinate the work of the agencies responsible for the Article X process must be made."" The NY-ISO added that an expedited approval process would improve the environment because older, more polluting power plants would be replaced by cleaner gas-fired units. On a more positive note, the NY-ISO reported that New York's restructured power market ""is far healthier than that in California, due in large part to the ability of New York `s utilities to enter long-term power contracts. The basic structure of the New York market will also reduce unwarranted price spikes and other market disruptions through mitigation programs which automatically correct price spikes due to market power abuses."" ""Nevertheless, California `s experience raises a caution flag for all New Yorkers,"" the report continued. ""The deregulated market in New York cannot achieve lower costs through competition without an increase in generating capacity similar in magnitude to the recommendations of this report, along with simultaneous efforts to institute greater conservation, better load management and alternative energy supply initiatives. Additionally, closer integration with regional suppliers of power is both inevitable and beneficial."" The report also recommended (1) accelerating conservation, real-time metering and price-sensitive load programs; and (2) upgrading the state's and the Northeast's transmission infrastructure. The Proposed Tariff Amendments -- New York's Article X siting process and continuing tight supplies were also cited in the NY-ISO's request to extend from 4/30/01 until 10/31/02 its $1,000/MWh bid caps. FERC first approved the 1,000/MWh bid caps in July 2000 (see REPORT No.197, pg.6), and subsequently extended them. The NY-ISO's board ""is sensitive to the Commission's concerns about undue intervention in energy markets,"" the filing related. ""Nevertheless, the NY-ISO is submitting this request because it believes that delays in New York state's `Article X' process for licensing and siting new generating capacity is inhibiting supply from increasing to match continued demand growth. . . . Moreover, although the NY-ISO proposes to implement several demand-side measures this summer, it is not yet clear whether they will make demand sufficiently price-responsive to avoid periods of high prices that would not occur if there were an efficient demand-side response."" Thus, the NY-ISO insisted that the requested extension is needed to provide more time for the development of additional generation and to gauge the effectiveness of the NY-ISO's proposed demand-side response mechanisms ""in order to avoid exposing consumers to price spikes that are not a product of the interplay of competitive market forces."" Other problems cited in the NY-ISO's filing which keep New York's power market from being fully competitive include continuing capacity and operating constraints at the state's Central-East interface, and questions over adequate gas supply. ""The NY-ISO remains acutely aware that taking steps to deal with price abnormalities can have undesirable consequences,"" the filing continued. ""Nevertheless, the NY-ISO believes that the $1,000/MWh cap that has been used in the PJM's markets since inception does not appear to have had an adverse impact there. . . . The permanent bid caps in PJM, and the interim bid caps in ISO New England (proposed for extension through the end of 2001) also make continuation of the NY-ISO's bid caps more important in order to maintain uniformity across the Northeastern markets. The NY-ISO also continues to believe that suppliers will not be materially harmed by the continuation of bid caps, which are likely to come into effect very rarely and are set at levels that prevent only artificially high run-ups in prices."" The NY-ISO's request to extend its TEP procedures (which also were previously extended) through 10/31/02 cited similar problems with New York's power markets, but claimed that the NY-ISO ""has made great strides"" toward eliminating market design and software flaws. ""The TEPs were, and remain, an indispensable tool for responding to and correcting market flaws and other instances where the markets are not operating as the NY-ISO and the Commission intended,"" the filing insisted. MASSACHUSETTS: Attorney general says summer poses electricity concerns By JOHN McELHENNY Associated Press Writer 03/19/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. BOSTON (AP) - The state's top consumer advocate warned that Massachusetts may see ""California-type"" electricity blackouts this summer when temperatures rise and residents turn on air conditioners and fans. ""It would be a mistake to feel this is a cold weather problem,"" said Attorney General Thomas Reilly in an interview with The Associated Press. ""Our major problem will come this summer."" State deregulation of the electric industry has been among the factors blamed for local power outages in California, and on Monday, California for the first time suffered rolling blackouts across the entire state. Massachusetts relaxed regulations on its own electric industry in 1998 to attract more companies to stir competition. But that hasn't happened yet, largely because the current high cost of oil and gas make it expensive to produce electricity. ""The promise of deregulation was that there was going to be competition,"" said Reilly, a Democrat. ""That competition in the wholesale market is not happening."" Hot summer weather drives up electricity use as residents turn on air conditioners and fans, and Reilly said a few particularly hot days could strain the grid that provides the region's power. A spokeswoman for the region's power grid said electricity use is expected to rise 1.5 to 2 percent this year, but the region should have enough power because of six new power plants that have begun generating electricity in the past 18 months. ""The situation is unlike California because we have new generation coming on line that is outpacing demand,"" said Ellen Foley, spokeswoman for ISO New England Inc., which manages the grid of 330 generators connected by 8,000 miles of high voltage transmission lines. Still, a particularly hot day and an unforeseen power generation breakdown could prompt ISO to ask residents to conserve electricity, a situation that arose once last summer, Foley said. In order to avoid any power outages and protect consumers, Reilly repeated calls for electric companies to build more power lines and to offer more options for new customers who have signed up since deregulation. Those customers typically pay more than long-term customers. Electric transmission companies should also be allowed to enter into two-year contracts with suppliers, instead of the six-month contracts many have now, to avoid short-term price spikes for consumers, Reilly said. The Attorney General's Office acts as an advocate for consumers. Michael Monahan, a spokesman for NSTAR, which provides electricity to more than 1 million customers, is upgrading some of its power lines and last year built a new line to Cape Cod, but currently has no lines under construction. ""I wholeheartedly concur with the attorney general that it's something we have to focus on,"" Monahan said, but he added, ""The indications I see are that we have an ample supply of electricity."" California's statewide outages were ordered on Monday after a transformer fire, high demand and a lack of electricity imports pushed power reserves to near zero. California partially deregulated its electric industry in 1996, two years before Massachusetts. --- On the Net: Attorney General's Office: http://www.ago.state.ma.us NSTAR: http://www.nstaronline.com ISO New England Inc.: http://www.iso-ne.com NEVADA: Discussion of bill stopping power plant sales to continue Wednesday By JOHN WILKERSON Associated Press Writer 03/19/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) - Lawmakers hit more delays Monday in trying to pass a measure that pulls the plug on the sale of Nevada power plants to avoid California-style energy problems. ""The goal of this bill is only stopping the divestiture of power plants and making sure it's constitutional,"" said Senate Commerce and Labor Chairman Randolph Townsend, R-Reno. ""And that's not as easy as it sounds."" Townsend's comment just before his committee began working on SB253 was prophetic - witnesses kept bringing up the need for more flexibility in the measure. Translation: Don't kill all deals by stopping Reno-based Sierra Pacific Power and Las Vegas-based Nevada Power from selling their Nevada power plants until June 2003 - and possibly until 2006. Pete Ernaut, a lobbyist for Reliant Energy which has been trying to buy a power plant, said unforeseen market changes could make a plant sale before 2003 a deal that would be in the public's interest. ""If you put a two-year moratorium on these plants, all these deals are going to go away,"" he said. ""When the cow leaves the barn, it's difficult to catch."" Townsend had hoped to wrap up committee work on SB253 on Monday. Now it's up for review again Wednesday in the Commerce and Labor Committee. Reliant isn't the only company trying to keep power plant purchases alive. Earlier this month, executives of Pinnacle West Energy told the committee that it's in the public's interest to allow Sierra Pacific Resources to sell its Harry Allen power plant. The Harry Allen plant produces about 72 megawatts out of the 2,900 megawatts of energy that Nevada utilities generate. Pinnacle has plans to expand that to 700 megawatts by 2004. Other provisions not strictly related to the plant divestitures, such as ways in which Sierra Pacific and Nevada Power can recover the cost of undoing the sales contracts, don't have to be included in SB253, Townsend said. Townsend said the other concerns dealing with the energy crisis and utility deregulation can be handled in later bills - but the power plant sale issue must be handled now. Nevada's PUC and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission had directed Sierra Pacific and Nevada Power to sell the plants as a condition of the companies' merger in 1999 under the parent company Sierra Pacific Resources. Critics of the plant sales say the plants generate about half the state's electricity - and if they're sold, the unregulated new owners could sell the power to other states and put Nevada into the energy dilemma California faces of shrinking supply and rising prices. The Southern Nevada Water Authority has presented an analysis stating that rate payers will save from $1.7 billion to $3.5 billion by July 2001 if the power plant sales are stopped. Nevada's Consumer Advocate's Office previously had projected a conservative estimate of $915 million in savings. MAINE: Panel of experts would review impact of energy deregulation By GLENN ADAMS Associated Press Writer 03/19/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) - In the wake of rolling blackouts in California and rate spikes in their home state, Maine's top legislators proposed a study Monday into the effects of deregulation of the energy industry. ""Deregulation of electricity is a new idea and we still have a lot to learn,"" Senate President Michael Michaud said as he called for the analysis. A panel of industry insiders, elected officials and consumers would study issues such as what standard rate consumers can expect and the likelihood of energy shortfalls over the next three years, and whether Maine consumers are vulnerable to anti-competitive activities. In addition, the Blue Ribbon Commission would look into whether changes in Maine's deregulation law are needed to encourage more generating capacity, improve conservation and spur competition. The study is being proposed as consumers remain mindful of a power crisis in California that resulted from high wholesale energy costs, a consumer rate cap and too few power plants in that deregulated state. Maine's deregulation law is designed to avoid such pitfalls, said Rep. William Savage, D-Buxton, House chairman of the Legislature's Utilities Committee. Maine's law does not cap consumer prices, as California's does, and the state has more than enough generating facilities to meet the state's energy needs, Savage said. Since Maine's deregulation law took effect in March 2000, Bangor Hydro-Electric Co. rates have increased 19 percent. The Public Utilities Commission approved a residential standard rate increase as recently as last month. Federal energy regulators are reviewing their decision to allow steep fee increases for utilities and power wholesalers that fail to arrange enough capacity to meet customers' peak load. Gov. Angus King and all four members of Maine's congressional delegation oppose the hike. The PUC has approved standard rate increases for energy delivered by Central Maine Power Co. to medium-sized and large industrial users. On the other hand, some towns and school districts are saving money on energy through deals they can get in the deregulated market. In the meantime, legislation has been introduced in response to some of the changes that have occurred in Maine's deregulated energy industry. One would use some of the money from the sale of power-generating assets to offset an increase in rates paid by large industrial users, said Sen. Norman Ferguson, R-Hanover, Senate chairman of the Utilities Committee. Supporters of the utility study that was proposed Monday said they are not looking to make changes in Maine's deregulation law, but if it needs fixing it could be done during next year's session. The lawmakers' primary interest is to find out how trends in a new environment designed to encourage competition will affect consumers, and to try to identify what consumers can expect in the few years ahead. House Speaker Michael Saxl, D-Portland, said the Legislature ""has a fundamental public policy interest in making sure rate-payers and businesses are protected against exorbitant rate hikes."" Michaud, D-East Millinocket, said he's interested in finding out how future changes in electric prices and availability might affect businesses and consumers in northern Maine. ""The economy in my part of the state is the most vulnerable, and I want to make certain we are leaving no stone unturned in our effort to prevent any shocks to the economy in northern, western and eastern Maine,"" Michaud added. The commission would include House and Senate members from each party, a utility executive, and representatives of energy producers, providers, a large commercial consumer and individual consumers. OREGON: State Senate moves to combat energy crisis 03/16/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. SALEM, Ore. (AP) - In an attempt to avoid a California-like energy crisis, the Oregon Senate approved a bill Friday that would quicken the process of siting power plants that use gas and renewable resources. ""It's important for Oregon. It makes sure that energy will be available to everyone,"" said Sen. Lee Beyer, D-Springfield. The measure, SB843, would shorten the siting process for power plants that use gas and renewable resources, like wind, from a year and a half to a matter of months. The speeded-up process would be in effect for two years. ""If we can act now, we can actually start to solve power supply problems by this summer,"" said Sen. Jason Atkinson, R-Jacksonville California's strict regulations on the construction of new power plants has contributed to its current shortage and legislators took note. Beyer said though California was definitely a wake-up call, the measure is a reaction to the larger power picture in the Northwest. With low rainfall, hydroelectric generators will have trouble meeting demand, Beyer said. Gas-fired and wind plants could come online as soon as this fall and would provide relief. ""We are not in a position to sit back and do nothing about the energy crisis the Northwest and the country are experiencing,"" said Senate Minority Leader Kate Brown, D-Portland. Conservationists, however, caution that lawmakers should be careful not to rush to provide power at the expense of environmental standards. WISCONSIN: Two utilities to add 975 megawatts in plan to avoid energy crisis By The Associated Press 03/22/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Plans of two state utilities to add 975 megawatts to Wisconsin's electric power grid as a way of avoiding an energy crisis similar to California's were questioned Thursday by a consumer advocate who said too many power plants may be in the works. ""Certainly nobody wants to see blackouts like you have in California but there is the danger Wisconsin could be overbuilding,"" said Steve Hiniker, executive director of the Citizens' Utility Board, which represents consumer interests in utility rate cases. He noted that plant construction costs ultimately are born by the utility customers. Alliant Energy Corp. announced its proposal Wednesday - in a filing with the state Public Service Commission - to spend $1 billion to build one coal and two gas-fired power plants. Alliant has proposed building a 500 megawatt coal-fired plant and a 100 megawatt natural-gas fired plant by 2006. It also wants to build a 200 megawatt natural gas-fired facility in 2011. Wisconsin has not built a coal-fired plant in more than two decades. Alliant has not determined the plants' locations. Also, Madison Gas & Electric, the state's smallest investor-owned utility, said Wednesday that it had signed deals to buy 175 megawatts of power from three generating plants in Wisconsin and Illinois. ""Three out of the four past summers, we've had public appeals for conservation due to shortages somewhere in the state. We need to take steps to avoid that, and the California situation makes that even more clear,"" said Alliant spokesman Chris Schoenherr. ""Getting more iron in the ground will give us more flexibility in the state to be able to react."" Alliant acknowledged the new plants will probably mean rate increases, but it was too early to say how much rates would go up. California's problems, which this week resulted in the first deliberate blackouts since World War II, stemmed from underestimating the state's power needs, forcing utilities to sell their power plants but not allowing them to secure long-term supply contracts, and freezing rates, among other things. But Wisconsin's situation is far different. The state has moved slower than California toward deregulation, and there has been no desire here to speed up the process in recent years as power reliability became a problem. The PSC estimates that Wisconsin will need an additional 3,000 megawatts of power over the next decade. Hiniker said Wisconsin needs to coordinate its planning to avoid overbuilding. The costs of new power plants are passed on to ratepayers, meaning electric bills will increase as new generation is added. In addition, coal-generated power plants are a major source of air pollution in the state. ""We don't have the advance planning that has kept Wisconsin from overbuilding in the past,"" said Hiniker. ""This is something the PSC should be doing."" MG&E's deals are: -A 10-year contract to buy 75 megawatts from Calpine Energy Services starting in May 2004. The power will come from the natural gas-fired plant Rock River Energy Center, near Beloit. Calpine Energy Services is a unit of San Jose, Calif.-based Calpine Energy Corp. The plant is being built by Northbrook, Ill.-based SkyGen Energy LLC, which Calpine bought last year from SkyGen President Michael Polsky and Wisvest Corp., a unit of Wisconsin Energy Corp. -A 10-year contract to buy 50 megawatts of power from the Rainy River Energy Corp. starting in May 2002. The power is coming from a natural gas-fired plant near Joliet, Ill. owned by LS Power Co. Rainy River is a unit of Duluth-based Minnesota Power Inc. -A five-year contract to buy 50 megawatts from an El Paso Merchant Energy plant near Cordova, Ill., in western Illinois. The owner of the natural gas facility is the Cordova Energy Center Co., which is a unit of Iowa-based MidAmerican Energy Holdings. Alliant also offered support in the Wednesday filing for a $7 billion plan of Milwaukee-based Wisconsin Energy, which includes five new power plants in Oak Creek and Pleasant Prairie. -- On the Net: CUB: http://www.wiscub.org/ Alliant Energy: http://www.alliant-energy.com Wisconsin Public Service Commission: http://www.psc.state.wi.us Wisconsin Energy: http://www.wisenergy.com/ Madison Gas & Electric: http://www.mge.com Use this file to download and print all the articles in this section (See attached file: Dow Jones If you wish to be removed from the distribution list for this update please contact Pru Sheppard - DC.

Back to story Most of West in the Same Power Jam as California Utilities: Other states ran their grids at fever pitches as populations swelled and few new energy sources were developed. Now, also facing blackouts, they want to tilt balance of power away from the Golden State and toward themselves. By PETER G. GOSSELIN, Times Staff Writer WINTERSBURG, Ariz.--For more than a century, California ran a simple account with the rest of the West: It demanded and the West supplied, most especially water and power. But as the Western states have ballooned in the last decade--in no small part because of an outbound trek of Californians--this simple, supply-demand relationship has broken down. Fundamentally, the rest of the West has outgrown its electrical system just as California has its own. And it has done so in very much the same way--by adding too many people without enough new power or conservation. Indeed, statistics show that much of the rest of the West would have been on the verge of trouble even without California's help and may yet face the sort of rolling blackouts that have wreaked so much havoc in the Golden State. The booming Southwest has run its power grid at such a fever pitch that its planning reserves--the extra power that utilities build in to handle emergencies--have shrunk to levels that many regulators and industry experts consider dangerous. Almost none of the West save Montana has increased its power production at anything like the pace of its population growth during the last decade. Despite the long economic boom of the 1990s, which smiled especially on the West, several, such as Arizona, have failed to complete a single new power plant. ""We don't know how bad it's going to be yet,"" said Utah's Republican governor, Mike Leavitt. ""We won't know that until May, June, July and August, when everyone in the Southwest turns on their swamp coolers."" In trying to dodge the blackout bullet, many Western leaders are seeking to force a great change on the region: to renegotiate their states' basic deal with California. They want to end an old relationship--that between center and hinterland, colonizer and colonized--and establish a new one that could curtail California's long regional dominance. In the strange chemistry of the moment--when a once-Republican state government has turned Democratic and a once-Democratic national government has turned Republican, when the battle is to a large extent over privately owned electricity rather than publicly controlled water--they could actually meet with some success. ""California spent the 20th century decolonizing itself from Wall Street and the East,"" said Kevin Starr, the state librarian and author of a multivolume history of California. ""Now, all of a sudden, there's a dramatic possibility of it being recolonized, at least in part, by the rest of the West."" Captive Plants Feed Power to California Ground zero for these changes lies 50 miles west of Phoenix in the dry scrublands of Wintersburg. This is home to the Palo Verde nuclear facility, now the nation's single biggest power producer. It will soon be home as well to between three and six new gas-fired power plants that, combined, will produce even more electricity than their giant neighbor. Palo Verde represents a great deal about the old, fraying world of regulated utilities and about the supply-demand relationships that California once maintained with the rest of the West. More than one-quarter of the plant is owned by Los Angeles' municipal utility, the Department of Water and Power, several other California cities and Southern California Edison. A row of steel latticework towers runs off toward California, carrying a transmission line from plant to consumer. California has big stakes in a half-dozen similarly captive plants in an arc of states from Nevada to New Mexico. From California's point of view, the beauty of these projects has been that they provided near-certain power without the muss of meeting state pollution standards or the political hassle of building closer to home. And at least until the mid-1990s, California regulators virtually guaranteed that their owners covered their costs and made profits, even if plants' power wasn't immediately needed. ""The first principle of the old system was that you had to be able to meet demand, no matter what,"" said Paul L. Joskow, a veteran utility economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""If you had too much power, if it cost you a little too much, that was less important than being sure you could meet demand."" And, he added, ""you had regulators watching to make sure you did."" The gas-fired plants that are about to pop up in Wintersburg are also representative, but of the new, deregulated world of power production. Although they will crowd in around Palo Verde and tap into the same California transmission line, they are being built on an entirely different business premise: selling power to the highest bidder. In fact, the reason this empty patch of desert has become such an electricity hot spot lately is not Palo Verde itself, but its huge transmission lines. In addition to the California line, four others fan out from the plant: two back to Phoenix, one east to New Mexico, and one north to Utah and from there to the Northwest. All were built to hard-wire the nuclear project to its owners. But they are now seen as the means by which a new breed of producer can get top dollar by sending power wherever prices are highest. ""It used to be generating capacity was built by people who looked at the market to see if they could meet demand,"" said Jack Davis, president of Pinnacle West Capital Corp., which owns Arizona's major utility and is putting up two of the Wintersburg plants. ""Now,"" he said approvingly, ""it's being built by people who look at the market to see if you can make a lot of money."" Plans Go Awry in Many States Money, not the watchful eye of government, was what was supposed to assure that electricity deregulation worked. The opportunity to make it would cause investors to flock to the electricity business, ensuring that plenty of new power plants got built. If too many went up, it would be investors, not ratepayers, who suffered. If too few, then high prices would attract still more investors, more plants and, ultimately, more power. But to date, almost nothing about deregulation has gone as planned--and not just in California, but in the West in general. Take Arizona. The state has a hands-off attitude toward business, including its utilities. It has almost none of the environmental restrictions blamed for keeping California from putting up the new plants it needs. Its population grew by 40% from 1990 to 2000, according to the Census Bureau. And its demand for electricity expanded at nearly twice that rate, according to industry figures. ""Arizona should have been a power producer's heaven,"" said A. Michael Schaal, a senior analyst with Energy Ventures Analysis Inc., a prominent Washington-area consulting firm. But Arizona's power production rose a mere 4% during the 1990s, mostly as a result of improving existing plants. Until 18 months ago, no one had applied to build a major power plant since Palo Verde in the late 1980s. ""I guess I go on the assumption that the utilities plan with some sort of 10-, 20-, 30-year time horizon,"" Arizona's Republican Gov. Jane Dee Hull said in a recent interview. ""I think what we all worry about is: Are they planning?"" Or Nevada. Its utilities apparently did plan and increased electricity-making capacity between 1990 and 2000 by a substantial 44%. But that wasn't enough to keep up with the state's population, which increased 66%. On Thursday, Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn, a Republican and former energy company executive, indefinitely halted deregulation in his state. Or traditionally energy-rich Washington state. One of its major utilities, Seattle City Light, recently learned that all of its previously planned supply increase for the next four years will be consumed, and then some, by just three new customers: computer server farms being built to handle the growing Internet traffic in and out of the high-tech capital. But it's unlikely to be able to get extra power soon because regional supplies are balanced on a ""razor's edge,"" according to Northwest Power Pool President Jerry Rust. ""We have no cushion."" Indeed, the electricity supplies of the entire West are balanced on a razor's edge, with a variety of forecasters predicting serious shortages this summer. Schaal, the Washington-area consultant, for example, said the region will come up 6% short. ""Westerners can expect 150 to 275 hours of rolling blackouts, most of them in California,"" he said. One of the most striking aspects of the current situation is that, in contrast to what most people think, supplies have not grown short just recently. They have been perilously tight for the last several years--before the start of California's troubles of this summer and fall, and before the near-record dry winter that has left the Northwest dangerously short of water for its hydroelectric dams. The implication is that California did not cause other states to run short of power so much as trigger events that exposed their danger. It did that, according to key observers, with one monumentally inept maneuver. When California required its major utilities to buy power in the volatile spot market and simultaneously prohibited them from passing along higher costs to consumers, it set off a furious price spiral. That effectively stripped the entire region of its energy security blanket, the assurance that it could buy extra power relatively inexpensively if local supplies proved inadequate. The result has been a string of crises across the West. In southern Arizona, for example, the San Carlos Irrigation Project, a tiny public utility that tried to jump into the deregulation vanguard by dropping long-term contracts in hopes of more power at lower prices in the spot market, has announced that its bills are going up 300%. Most of the project's 13,300 poor customers say they can't pay. In Phoenix, utility executives who had confidently said the state was rich with new power projects about to come on line have decided to pull two 50-year-old steam plants out of mothballs and rent a pair of portable generators to reduce purchases from the expensive spot market. In Idaho, the big power company is appealing to potato farmers to skip planting and sell the electricity they would use running irrigation pumps back to the firm. Company executives figure the buyback will be cheaper than purchasing power on the open market--and the potato farmers are likely to do pretty well themselves. Deep Hostility in Rest of the West The subtle difference between California's triggering recent events and actually causing the region's crisis is largely lost in the current atmosphere of apprehension and upheaval. Although leaders of the rest of the West are scrupulously evenhanded in commenting to outsiders about their big neighbor, they are less guarded at home. The normally mild-mannered Leavitt, for example, was recently quoted as warning a Salt Lake City audience that ""California, if given the chance, would put a shunt into our veins and bleed us pretty quickly."" (In an interview, he denied having made the remark.) Such comments reflect an old and easily rekindled view among Westerners that their states are, in the words of historian Bernard DeVoto, ""plundered provinces""--terrain that first Easterners and then Californians have regularly raided for minerals, water and, most recently, power. But this time, some Western leaders think they can change all this. ""A lot of people see an opportunity to rewrite the fundamental relationship with California to their advantage,"" said Stanford historian Richard White. The attempts at rewriting are taking shape across the West. In the Northwest, Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Montana are redoubling their efforts to take over the Bonneville Power Administration, the huge, federally controlled generating system on the Columbia and Snake rivers that is one of California's chief sources of summer electricity. ""The crisis has highlighted the danger that power generated in the region can be exported without the region's consent,"" Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber said in an interview. In Arizona, state officials have gone from having no proposals for new power plants to being buried by them. Regulators recently approved the construction of 10 plants, including several around Palo Verde, and are considering another eight. Although they are requiring the plants to temporarily serve Arizona's needs first, the facilities will soon be able to sell their power for whatever prices they can command, an arrangement that could leave California just one among many bidders. (Federal officials are unlikely to get in the way: Gov. Hull is close to President Bush, who in turn has shown little interest in helping Democratic California.) Perhaps the most aggressive efforts at change are occurring in Utah, where Leavitt is trying something that could become California's worst nightmare--recalling power that Utah produces for the state. Los Angeles' DWP and several other California utilities own three-quarters of the huge, coal-fired Intermountain Power Project in west-central Utah, and have been drawing on it without incident for 15 years. But Utah officials recently unearthed a long-forgotten provision in their agreement with the plant's owners that gives them the right, with proper notice, to recall power for local use. The state has already notified Los Angeles that it is taking back 50 megawatts of electricity capacity this summer and another 170 next summer, and it may be able to take back still more, according to plant general manager Reed Searle. Although the amounts are trivial--the Los Angeles utility either owns or has firm contracts for more than 7,000 megawatts of capacity--Leavitt said Utah will demand similar recall provisions in agreements for any new plants in the state, including a 500- to 750-megawatt facility that Los Angeles is negotiating to build. ""California has chosen not to create its own power generation and has depended on us to do that,"" the Utah governor said. ""That's fine and we're willing to do that. ""But,"" he added, ""there comes a point at which, if demand grows too large, we've got to hold some of this capacity back for ourselves, and for our children and grandchildren."" If Utah and the rest of the West have reached that point, California could be in for a much bigger and more enduring shock than the one from which it now suffers. --- Times researcher Lynn Marshall in Seattle contributed to this report.

Questions the report raises for Enron: Is Enron part of the oil & natural gas sector or the banking and finance sector? Both are looking at information sharing mechanism to mitigate risks to IT systems. The Banking & Finance sector has been operating an information sharing and analysis center (ISAC) for over a year. Discussions with members of the banking and finance sector indicate it has value. If Enron is a part of the oil & natural gas sector, are we willing to take a leadership role and enter into a potential LLC with other Council member companies to form an ISAC for this sector? Cost to Enron would be based on number of individuals receiving alerts etc., however, it could be as low as $13K per year. An additional cost would be to appoint an employee to the LLC's governance body to ensure Enron's needs were addressed. Archie Dunham, CONOCO's Chairman, has agreed to champion this initiative if the Council recommends it at the 6 June meeting. Current coordination: The legal issues have been worked by a sub-group lead by Tom Carmel, CONOCO. Mark Holsworth, Corp. Legal has been our representative. Recent DOJ action regarding information sharing to mitigate IT risks seems to indicate that anti-trust will not be an issue. Steptoe & Johnson, LLP have undertaken a review of the liability issues and suggested ways to mitigate them. Mike Hicks and I have been working with Mark Thibodeaux, Corp. IT Compliance, and will be meeting with Steve Kean and others in the security and IT protection efforts in next two weeks. Recommendation: Enron participate fully in the oil and natural gas sector's efforts - As Enron becomes more and more dependant on IT, having a mechanism that provides tailored vulnerability information and solutions in a ""one-stop-shop"" format is valuable and can lead to reduced insurance premiums.

 choice","I think we need some clear indication that with Hogan on the Board this is not going to turn into a diatribe about the benefits of LMP. He's the most informed of the bunch and I doubt he would find a general work of interest (unless he can create a platform for his more detailed ideas). If it stays general, I think the study is a good idea. One topic area might be to explore how politicians mess up the basic idea of deregualtion and suggest that the process needs to be handled in a more objective (and pure) fashion.

Teece---and the lion's share of the folks on the participants list---are advocates of a minimalist role for government, particularly where markets are a clear and preferably option, as in the case of electricity. That said, I think we're going to have to make a fundamental decision about what the goal of this ""study"" would be, which will determine, to a large degree, whether we choose to pursue it. I'll throw out for comment the notion that the study should be designed to serve one purpose: to influence the policy decision currently under debate ""To de-regulate or not."" As such, I wouldn't see issues like ""PJM or APX"" or ""competitive default supplier or not,"" or ""divest generation with vesting contracts or retain the assets"" being the focus. That debate over critically important implementation details, would seem to come in ""Round 2,"" once the initial debate over ""deregulate or not"" is won. To try to do both, i.e., resolve in the broad policy issue AND make the case for the specific, ""right"" implementation plan, would arguably bog the study down, perhaps interminably. And it seems that time is of the essence in the current environment. In addition, unless the fundamental policy issue is won--and won rather quickly--debating implementation may be moot. Of course, it will be impossible to avoid some level of dicussion on ""how to do it,"" but that would not be the emphasis. In sum, I'd suggest for comment that it only makes sense to proceed---particularly since time is of the essence---if we focus on the high level policy level question of ""to deregulate or not,"" and address implementation in a second, or follow up, study. I think we should try to make a call on this swiftly, since the ""go/no go"" decision would seem to flow from resolution of this issue.

Clearly, we're at a fork in the policy road---move forward, or go back. I've (finally) gotten a proposal from the group. It's attached. Please take a look. I'd like to distribute more widely internally for comment, but wanted to run it through a preliminary screen to guage whether folks think it would be useful before cluttering up folks' in-boxes with more emails to read. Few points worth mentioning: The majority of the academics that would do the report are affiliated with LECG, Inc., the consulting group that I worked with prior to joing Enron. List also includes Dan McFadden, UC Berkeley nobel prize winner who wrote the recent op-ed piece in the WSJ. The list also includes Hogan and Joskow and Borenstein. We could certainly exclude these folks should we choose to go forward with the analysis. However, the goal is to produce a high level analysis, i.e., ""de-regulation is good and can work; command and control regulation is bad and we know that it does not work."" Once the study is released (if it is pursued), the ""authors"" could tour the country, testifying before federal and state bodies to advocate the virtues of de-regulation and the pitfalls of reversing course. The analysis would not be a debate over ""To Poolco, or not to Poolco, PJM, etc."" In this way, including folks like Joskow and Hogan could offer the added benefit of creating a ""Nixon goes to China"" scenario. Please take a look at the list of participants. Again, we can add to and subtract from the list. Laura Tyson would be one of the two project leaders. (The other would be David Teece, Chairman of LECG.) None of the folks on the list occupies either extreme of the political spectrum. It's a mix of D's and R's who are arguably centrist economist and strong believers in markets (I won't vouch for Joskow and Hogan). The idea would be to get a wide array of industry participants from across the country to support the project. This is for two reasons: 1) the more diverse the group supporting the effort, the greater the credibility, and 2) they are asking for about $1 million to do the study. If you think it would be useful to pursue the study as part of our national campaign to minimize the damage created by California, I would like to start immediately to approach trade associations, companies, customers, etc. nationwide to garner support for the project. Let me know if you think the effort would be worthwhile. Appreciate your comments.

Davis's Plan To Power California --- State's Outlays for Electricity May Be Hard to Recover Without Rate Increases --- Betting on Long-Term Deals ------------------------ Breakthrough made in rescue of PG&E State ready to pay $7 billion for lines By Steve Geissinger SACRAMENTO BUREAU SACRAMENTO -- Signaling a breakthrough in secret energy crisis talks, the Davis administration disclosed Tuesday it may announce the framework of a pact to rescue the teetering Pacific Gas and Electric Co. next week. ""Things are going very well,"" said Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis. The state appears to be poised to pay at least $7 billion -- and possibly billions more -- for PG&E's high-voltage transmission lines as part of a deal to financially renovate the north-state utility, according to sources familiar with the negotiations. But consumer advocates insisted that even the $7 billion price is too much to pay. And experts warned that a deal with PG&E will be more complex than with other utilities. PG&E representatives declined comment, in keeping with their policy on the talks, even though the Davis administration said an announcement could come as early as next week or the following week. The new timetable for an announcement was substantially sooner than in Davis' original forecast. Until late last week, PG&E was still resisting the sale of its power grid despite the fact that Davis had announced the framework of an agreement with Southern California Edison. Davis expects to soon announce a similar deal with the San Diego Gas and Electric Co. However, any such deal still would need federal approval. The investor-owned utilities, trapped between high wholesale costs and lower, regulated retail rates, amassed nearly $13 billion in debts and were unable to buy electricity this winter. With the onset of rolling blackouts, the state began brokering billions of dollars in emergency short- and long-term power purchases. Davis' strategy to ease the energy price and supply crisis includes bolstering both conservation and generation while fiscally refurbishing the nearly bankrupt utilities. As part of the rescue deal, the utilities would have to drop legal actions seeking dramatically higher electricity bills, environmentally shield wildlands they own, sell power from their generators to Californians for the next decade and secure help with their debts from their parent companies. Together with the cash infusion from the sale of their power 26,000-mile power grids, the utilities would be allowed to sell bonds to raise funds and use customer money to pay them off. The state would upgrade the high-voltage lines and lease them back to the utilities for operation. In a reflection of the negotiations with the three utilities, a Davis administration official said the deal with PG&E is proving to be more complex than with the other firms. Though PG&E finally agreed late last week to sell its transmission grid, the utility apparently wants more than the $7 billion that Davis has offered, according to sources. The figure is more than twice the book amount, or the value placed on the system for purposes of accounting. And that's the markup that lured Edison into an agreement to sell its smaller portion of the transmission grid for $2.8 billion. But PG&E, which fears an erosion of its economic base, may be asking as much as $10 billion. Due to complexities in the state's 1996 deregulation of the industry, PG&E is more likely to lose revenue than Edison as a result of selling its transmission lines, according to experts. Big customers might be able to bypass the utility's remaining local distribution lines, thereby eroding its customer base. Therefore the utility may view bankruptcy, and sale of its transmission lines to the highest bidder, as a potentially attractive alternative to selling its share of the grid to the state at too low a price. ---- El Paso Energy closes six valley power plants Filed: 03/07/2001 By CHIP POWER, Californian staff writer e-mail: ppower@bakersfield.com El Paso Energy, citing non-payment from Pacific Gas & Electric Co., said it has shut down six cogeneration plants this week. The smaller plants produced about 175 megawatts of electricity and are located primarily in the San Joaquin Valley, said company spokesman Mel Scott. A megawatt can supply power to 1,000 homes. At least 10 plants have closed in the past two weeks as a result of non-payment, according to the state Independent System Operator, which manages most of the state's electrical distribution. The El Paso Energy plants are operated with various partners and had not been compensated for December, January and February deliveries, said Scott. He said he did not know the total amount due but said the plants would be closed until PG&E's credit worthiness is improved. A cogeneration plant, common in oil fields, simultaneously produces heat energy and electrical or mechanical power from the same fuel in the same facility. Typically, it produces electricity and steam, which can be deployed to enhance oil recovery. Kern County is the state's leading oil-producing county. El Paso owns or has interests in more than 40,000 miles of interstate and intrastate pipeline connecting the nation's principal natural gas supply regions to the five largest consuming regions in the United States, namely the Gulf Coast, California, the Northeast, the Midwest and the Southeast. El Paso closed up 99 cents on Tuesday, or 1.4 percent, at $71.49. The Houston-based company's stock price has ranged between $36.31 and $75.30 in the last 52 weeks. ---- Still undecided: Who'll pay DWR for electricity By Karen Gaudette ASSOCIATED PRESS SAN FRANCISCO -- The price tag is $3.2 billion and counting for electricity bought by the state Department of Water Resources for the customers of two nearly bankrupt utilities. Pacific Gas and Electric Co., Southern California Edison and the state disagree over how the DWR eventually will be reimbursed for its purchases on the expensive last-minute power market. So do the state power regulators, who have the final call over who gets the money when. Under a recent law, the DWR went into the electricity-buying business to help keep the two utilities from sinking further into their $13 billion debt. The state plans to retrieve the money by selling $10 billion in revenue bonds. The utilities continue to collect ratepayer dollars on that electricity, which the bill's author, Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, says is meant to help them begin paying down their debt. In a recent letter, however, DWR officials requested that the state Public Utilities Commission order that a portion of that money be diverted to the state. But after the utilities subtract the costs of generating electricity, payments to environmentally friendly power plants and other expenses, there is no money left from ratepayer dollars to give to the DWR without sinking further into debt, PG&E spokesman Ron Low said Tuesday. If it passed along money to the DWR, ""our undercollection would grow by about $2.4 billion by the end of the year,"" Low said. The commission, unable to agree on the best course of action, left the issue untouched at its last meeting but expects to revisit the issue when it meets this morning. Commissioner Richard Bilas is proposing an alternate plan that would have the DWR set its own revenue requirements that would be passed on to ratepayers. The PUC also is expected to respond to complaints from laid-off workers and customers that layoffs by utilities to cut costs have been hurting service. Commissioner Carl Wood warned at the last meeting that failure to provide safe and reliable service could mean fines for the utilities. Representatives from electrical workers unions, the PUC and the utilities were to discuss the issue Tuesday afternoon. ""I don't think we believe that utilities can find a way out of their problems by laying off workers,"" said Mindy Spatt, a spokeswoman with the Utility Reform Network. ""We think consumers deserve safe and reliable service, and we think they deserve it at a reasonable price."" ---- State Taxpayers In Dark on Details Of Energy Deal David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer Wednesday, March 7, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle Few people would purchase a car simply because the dealer said, ''Trust me, it's a great deal.'' Yet Gov. Gray Davis essentially is telling Californians just that about dozens of long-term power contracts. Because of confidentiality agreements with power companies, the governor has revealed only scant details about the state's multibillion-dollar contracts for electricity over the next 10 years. ""Gov. Davis has our money, and we can't see how he's spending it,"" said Doug Heller, a spokesman for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. ""We've been locked out of the room."" Neither Davis nor power companies would divulge specific details about the price, duration or scope of individual contracts. Each cited secrecy clauses that the governor's office said had been desired by both sides. What consumers do know is this: -- California has signed 40 contracts and tentative accords, valued at about $40 billion, to secure enough power to light 9 million homes over the next decade. -- The average purchase price of each deal is $69 per megawatt hour -- well above the $30 to $40 charged by power generators before California's energy market went haywire last summer. -- If, as is widely expected, wholesale power prices fall in years ahead, the state nevertheless will be locked into paying above-market rates for electricity. But it is not known which generator agreed to part with the most power at the cheapest level or the full range of the prices in concocting the $69 average. Moreover, it is unclear how shrewdly the state negotiated with taxpayer money in securing power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities. ""These agreements are the bedrock of our long-term energy policy,"" Davis said Monday in announcing the deals. The governor's office defended the murky nature of the contracts yesterday. ""It's a business transaction in which private corporate information is included,"" said Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Davis. ""That's the kind of information that never gets revealed."" While additional elements of the contracts will be publicized in coming months, he said, the contracts themselves will remain a secret. ""You'll never see all the details,"" Maviglio said. This did not sit well with many observers. ""It's a breach of public trust,"" said Daniel Bacon, a San Francisco attorney specializing in business law. ""A public servant spending public money shouldn't be able to keep the spending secret."" But Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an energy-industry association in Menlo Park, called confidentiality agreements ""a necessary evil in transactions like this."" He explained that no power company would agree to a long-term contract if rival firms could learn the terms of the accord. The company would be losing too much of its competitive edge in the marketplace, Ackerman said. At the same time, he noted that secrecy allowed the buyer -- in this case, California taxpayers -- to secure more favorable terms with individual sellers. A high price with one generator would not necessarily be sought by all power providers. Still, the fact that public funds are being used makes confidentiality in this case a different matter than, say, Cisco Systems' quietly negotiating to take over yet another tech rival. ""The public is in a very awkward position,"" said Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. ""It has to rely on the good word and expertise of the governor, and he has yet to demonstrate that he has expertise or good word in this field."" Shames likened consumers to passengers in a plane being flown by a pilot without a license to fly. ""But what choice do we have?"" he asked. ""I don't see many other options available right now."" There's the rub. No matter how bad a deal California may have cut to help meet its energy demands, the alternative -- blackouts, disruptions, economic catastrophe -- is far, far worse. On the other hand, it already appears that the new contracts will not shield Californians from the threat of daily outages this summer, when demand surges. Davis said only about 60 percent of the state's summertime electricity needs so far had been met. Part of the reason is that many power companies already have contracted for their output this year. Duke Energy said this was why it would not begin its nine-year contract with California until 2002, while Williams Cos. said it would only gradually increase the amount of available wattage in its 10-year contract. Both companies, meanwhile, will continue to profit this summer by selling into the volatile ""spot"" market, where wholesale power went for as much as $1, 500 per megawatt hour last year. ""You can't sell all your power into long-term contracts,"" said Paula Hall- Collins, a Williams spokeswoman. ""You save some for the spot market."" Consumer groups worry that consumers will be hammered again this summer with sky-high power prices, and then get nailed down the road by contracts for above-market rates. ""If we could look at the terms of the deals, we'd see that California is being gouged for 10 years,"" said Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. ""But the governor doesn't want us to see that."" Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum said the state had gotten the best rates it could under current market conditions. ""California went for long-term contracts when everyone else moved in as well,"" he said. ""Californians are paying a price for not acting sooner."" ---- Lawmakers pitch fixes for region's energy woes By David Whitney Bee Washington Bureau (Published March 7, 2001) WASHINGTON -- California members of Congress pleaded for everything from wholesale price caps to extending daylight-saving time an extra hour to help the region cope this summer with its persistent electricity shortage, but none of the ideas seemed to catch fire at a House hearing Tuesday. ""People will die in California because of this crisis,"" Rep. Brad Sherman, a Los Angeles-area Republican, warned the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Sherman testified that his idea for saving lives is to extend daylight-saving time by an extra hour, so that there would be more daylight at the end of the day when power consumption surges. ""One of the peak demand periods for electricity occurs between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m., when the sun sets and people come home from work,"" Sherman testified. ""If people come home and it is light out, there is less of an inclination to turn a light on."" Sherman said the state Legislature has called for congressional approval for states to be given authority to extend daylight-saving time, and he cited analyses by the California Energy Commission and other agencies suggesting that it could cut power consumption by 1 percent to 2 percent. Sherman, who was one of about a dozen California lawmakers presenting their views on the energy squeeze, drew no questions from committee leaders about what his legislation might do to everything from airline schedules to television programming if West Coast states didn't agree on the same time standard. Most of the committee's questioning was on the more popular idea proposed by several California and Western lawmakers, primarily Democrats, to require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose caps on wholesale electricity prices that have gone wild because of a regional power shortage. Rep. Bob Filner, D-San Diego, charged that the price spiral has little to do with power shortages but a lot to do with a ""small cartel"" of generators bilking ratepayers. Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., said he brought up the idea of regional price caps with President Bush, who was initially skeptical. But Inslee said that Bush warmed to the idea after being told that protections could be built into the caps so as not to discourage construction of new power plants. Upon hearing that, Inslee said, Bush invited him to meet with the president's Cabinet-level task force led by Vice President Dick Cheney on a national energy strategy. But Inslee said he can't get the group to meet with him. ""It's very disappointing,"" Inslee said. Tuesday's hearing was part of a series the panel is holding on the California crisis, so far without any emerging consensus on what, if anything, Congress should do. ---- Power plan called wrong Wall Street analysts say the governor's approach to the problem avoids the issue that caused the imbalance. March 7, 2001 By DON THOMPSON The Associated Press SACRAMENTO California's scramble to insulate consumers from the soaring price of electricity may add to the state's power problems this summer, Wall Street analysts said Tuesday. Gov. Gray Davis' emphasis on buying utilities' transmission lines and negotiating long-term power contracts to help ease their debts skirts the deep imbalance between wholesale and market rates that led to the state's power problems in the first place, they said. ""In the long run, it doesn't solve anything,"" said Michael Worms, an industry analyst for Gerard Klauer Mattison & Co. ""In the long run, you need to send the right price signals to consumers, which will create its own conservation signals. Unfortunately, customers were shielded from that in California."" Davis said Monday that the state's first contracts to buy electricity for two financially struggling utilities will provide only about two-thirds of the power needed on a typical summer day, forcing Californians to cut power use at least 10 percent to avoid blackouts. Since early January, the state has been buying one- third of the power Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. customers need. The two utilities, denied credit by suppliers, say they have lost nearly $14 billion due to soaring wholesale electricity prices that the state's industry-deregulation law says they cannot pass on to consumers. The keepers of the state power grid had enough electricity Tuesday to avoid declaring an electricity alert, but have faced an almost-daily scramble for weeks due to a tight supply and high wholesale prices. Several wholesale and retail rate proposals are circulating. Among them: Free-market advocates such as Worms want an immediate end to the deregulation-imposed retail rate freeze on Edison and PG&E that will expire next year. Davis wants a Western price cap of $100 per megawatt hour on power generators he says have been prof iteering from California's short energy supply. The Bush administration and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission are cool to that idea. In December, FERC imposed a ""soft cap"" of $150 per megawatt hour on wholesale rates in the state and required suppliers to justify any higher prices they charge. Consumer groups such as The Utility Reform Network, or TURN, want regulated rates for residential and small-business customers, but free-market rates for large industrial customers, which sought deregulation in the first place. TURN also advocates a tiered rate structure, with higher rates for consumers who use more than a reasonable amount of electricity each month. Assembly Republicans say electricity and natural-gas prices will fall naturally if the state increases supply, mainly by making it easier to build plants and pipelines. ""Right now, you're sort of sitting partially with regulation and part with the free market,"" said Paul Fremont, an analyst with Jefferies & Co. ""Both these systems work. It's sort of that in-between system that you have in Califor nia that doesn't appear to be working."" The system discourages generators from building new power plants because they aren't guaranteed a profit, and it doesn't do enough to discourage power use by consumers because the price they pay doesn't reflect the true cost of power, Fremont said. ""I don't think people here have much faith in the market, and why should they?"" countered TURN's Mindy Spatt. ""I think there are probably better ways of encouraging consumers to conserve than by gouging them."" Davis insists the crisis can be resolved without raising rates for Edison and PG&E customers beyond ""the existing rate structure."" In January, state regulators imposed temporary rate hikes of 7 to 15 percent on Edison and PG&E customers. The Legislature and Davis extended the increases for up to a decade to help pay back the estimated $10 billion in power buying the state expects to do for Edison and PG&E over the next several years, and finance its purchase of the power lines owned by the two companies and San Diego Gas & Electric. Rates were already scheduled to increase next year for Edison and PG&E customers. Under the 1996 deregulation law, the pair's ratepayers saw a 10 percent rate reduction, but only until early 2002. That rate cut will likely expire as planned, Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio has said. Davis wants those rates to cover not only the traditional cost of generating, transporting and distributing power, but the added cost of paying off the two utilities' massive debt and buying their transmission lines, said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, the Assembly's chief power negotiator. Yet Davis has indirectly addressed the rate imbalance by signing legislation that will let regulators raise consumer rates if necessary, Keeley said. The governor and lawmakers are in effect spreading out rate increases over a decade by using long-term revenue bonds to buy power for the nearly bankrupt utilities, said Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy Institute. ""At some point we have to deal with the reality that all of the power that we buy has to be paid for by somebody - it's either going to come from taxpayers or it's going to come from ratepayers,"" Bor enstein said. ""Raising rates now would get us a lot of conservation."" Davis also wants financial incentives for conservation and power-plant construction in time to make a difference this summer. ""Our mouths were agape"" at the rapid timetable, Keeley said. Legislators are rushing to pass those incentives by month's end, he said, allowing three months for consumers and suppliers to act before the heat of summer. Among bills considered Tuesday, the Senate Energy Committee approved legislation to accelerate the siting of power plants. It also was considering a proposal to restructure rates for generators that use renewable energy to provide about 30 percent of the state's electricity. ---- Bill to Cut Some Power Prices Stalls Energy: Democrats balk at varying payment levels for alternative generators. By DAN MORAIN, JULIE TAMAKI, Times Staff Writers SACRAMENTO--Legislation aimed at cutting prices for more than a fourth of the power consumed in California stalled Tuesday, as Democrats questioned why a few alternative energy generators--some of them campaign donors--stood to receive higher payments than others. Lawmakers working to unravel California's energy mess have been negotiating for weeks in an effort to cut the price paid to more than 600 generators of alternative power by more than half, to below 8 cents a kilowatt-hour. Those alternative generators' contracts with utilities have shot up in recent months because of a rise in the price of natural gas. The cash-strapped corporations have suspended or made partial payments to the generators over the last few months, causing many to shut down or reduce their outputs. But even as the lawmakers reached agreement that pushed the average price to near the 8-cent level per kilowatt-hour, some generators would have received higher prices under the bill by state Sen. Jim Battin (R-La Quinta). Some of the generators that stood to benefit had donated to Battin's campaigns. One--Windtec Inc.--gave Battin a $20,000 campaign donation in 1999. Others contributed from $3,000 and $5,000 last year. Battin acknowledged that he has received campaign contributions from some wind power generators but said there is no connection between the donations and the bill's provisions. ""It is illegal, it is unethical and it's not how I do business,"" he said. Battin noted that 25% of the state's alternative energy producers are in his district. As Democrats on the Senate Energy Committee blocked the bill, Battin warned that some alternative energy producers might react to the delay by trying to force Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric into bankruptcy. ""We will be the cause of bankruptcy,"" Battin said. That prompted Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) to retort: ""I'm really tired of being threatened with bankruptcy."" Alternative energy producers, including those that use wind, solar power, biomass and other means, produce 27% of the energy used in California. They sell the electricity to the utilities, which in turn transmit it to retail consumers. But with the utilities facing multibillion-dollar debts, the alternative energy producers under contract with Edison have not been paid since November. Scores of alternative energy producers supported the measure. Edison International and the San Francisco-based consumer group, the Utility Reform Network, opposed it. Michael Florio of the Utility Reform group said the deal could result in higher consumer prices; an Edison representative said the same thing. Battin and Assemblyman Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek) worked out an arrangement with many of the generators. Keeley took the lead in the early negotiations, and then turned to Battin to introduce the legislation, SB 47X. Rather convoluted language would have allowed higher payments to a select few generators that produce electricity from wind and biomass. Most of California's wind suppliers, for instance, would have received about 6 cents per kilowatt-hour. But a handful of them, about half a dozen wind farms--mostly in the Palm Springs area represented by Battin--would have received 7.8 cents. Battin contends that other wind producers receive additional payments that boost them to the same level as Windtec and others that would get the higher payments. ""They get the same deal,"" Battin said of the handful of generators that would benefit from the provisions he added to the bill. In California's overall energy market, the amount of money that would have flowed to the favored generators is minor. But the added prices that would have been paid to the generators would have translated to at least $19 million in the next five years, to be absorbed by Southern California Edison customers, according to one analysis. Also Tuesday, more details were disclosed about another leg of the state's effort to escape from the energy crunch--the deals with large power generators to supply electricity to California for as long as 10 years. Those arrangements were announced by Gov. Gray Davis Monday as ""the bedrock"" of California's energy policy. But some consumer advocates warned that the deals could lock the state into excessively high-priced contracts. S. David Freeman, the general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Davis' negotiator, said that the state guarded against that by varying the time spans of its deals. About 6,000 megawatts are expected to be available this summer, about one-third of the energy needed by the state, Freeman said. The amount of power under contract swells until more than 9,000 megawatts are contracted in 2004, half of the needed amount, before dipping to 8,000 megawatts in 2010. ""What we're doing here is what everybody said had to be done,"" Freeman said. ""We deliberately bought 50% so we'd have a good mix between long-term contracts, which may turn out to be somewhat higher or somewhat lower than the spot market,"" and purchases on the spot market. ---- PG&E could face mutiny on outages: SMUD, others may balk if utility orders summer blackouts By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer (Published March 7, 2001) Sacramento's electric utility wants out of a deal that imposes rolling blackouts locally on PG&E's command. So do a lot of other utilities. They've been writing letters, lobbying lawmakers and launching informal talks with Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to get off the hook before summer. Who dodges the blackout bullet ""is going to play out as a political hot button"" around the state, said George Fraser, head of the Northern California Power Agency, a coalition of municipal utilities. In Sacramento, the next volley is expected soon, with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District reportedly poised to notify PG&E that it will no longer black out homes and businesses on the larger utility's command. ""We are absolutely trying to fight off the requirement for rolling blackouts for the Sacramento area,"" said Linda Davis, one of seven elected members of the SMUD board of directors. Saying they don't want to be dragged down by somebody else's problems, two Southern California utilities have written grid operators asking to be exempted from any blackouts caused by PG&E's or Southern California Edison's financial woes. But in PG&E's view, ""California is in an energy crisis (and) ... we're all in this together,"" said spokesman John Nelson. The maneuvering comes amid bleak forecasts for power supplies this summer. Although Gov. Gray Davis has said conservation, new power plants and moderate weather could avert blackouts, officials at the Independent System Operator, which runs much of California's grid, expect frequent rotating outages. One consulting firm, Cambridge Energy Research Associates, predicts 20 hours of rolling blackouts during July and August, and about 200 hours of especially intense calls for voluntary cutbacks. Before blackouts hit, the jockeying over just whose lights, air conditioners and assembly lines will be shut down is growing. The outcome could affect millions of people statewide. The state Public Utilities Commission is probing rolling blackout programs run by the for-profit utilities it regulates, including PG&E and Edison. A PUC analysis has suggested that PG&E's program, which currently exempts about 40 percent of its customers, should spread the burden more broadly. For example, it said, 1.9 million homes and businesses are spared just because they share a circuit with a customer deemed ""essential."" But not-for-profit utilities such as SMUD, which answer to their own elected boards or city councils, have other worries. Many have already lined up their power supplies for summer. Some have raised rates or are considering raising rates. Some have taken extra conservation steps. They think those preparations ought to give them leverage to ease blackout clauses in their contracts with PG&E. SMUD general manager Jan Schori ""is going to use every avenue ... any avenue, to put pressure on,"" including lobbying the ISO, the governor and others, said utility director Davis. The Northern California Power Agency, a joint-powers authority that owns and operates power plants for municipal utilities, has begun informal negotiations with PG&E to change blackout rules, according to Fraser, its top executive. It is preparing to write PG&E, asking that its members be exempted from outages altogether. Failing that, it wants them to face fewer outages or to be compensated for cutting off power, he said. At SMUD, the utility board has met in closed session to discuss exactly what it is required to do during electric emergencies, under terms of the interconnection contract that links SMUD's lines to PG&E's. ""The contracts are being inspected with a fine-tooth comb,"" said SMUD director Howard Posner. Schori declined to comment on any specifics. Sources indicated that the main option being considered is notifying PG&E that because of changed circumstances, SMUD believes it no longer is required to routinely comply with outage requests. Other options being explored include re-negotiating existing agreements with PG&E. Posner said that ever since two days of rolling blackouts in January, constituents have been asking him, "" 'Why are we participating when we're not the problem?' And I don't have a good answer to that."" Several directors said SMUD has already spent a lot of money -- and is considering 16 percent rate increases -- to ensure that it has enough electricity under contract to meet its customers' summer demands. They believe PG&E should do the same. ""We're almost like a David against Goliath here,"" said board vice president Genevieve Shiroma. ""The huge investor-owned utilities next door have severe problems that they need to get under control."" In addition, SMUD plans to argue that because it can cut usage through its ""Peak Corps"" program, which remotely turns off air conditioners at volunteer households, it has already done its part without rotating outages, director Davis said. PG&E believes the interconnection agreements that govern smaller utilities' ties to its transmission lines have ""benefits and burdens to both sides,"" said Nelson. ""It wouldn't be fair or good policy for just one provision to be altered without taking a look at how that affects the entire contract,"" he said. Interconnection contracts generally have clauses that require utilities to help each other out to avert greater emergencies. Sometimes reducing demand -- called load shedding -- can be the only way to stabilize the electric grid in the seconds after a major power plant or transmission line fails. ""It's been around in the electrical fabric forever,"" said Jim Pope, head of Silicon Valley Power, Santa Clara's city-run utility. In addition to legal requirements, ""you have a moral obligation so you don't bring the system to collapse."" Like other city-run utilities, Silicon Valley Power has a contract with PG&E that requires it to shed load during an electric emergency. But its contract allows it to work with big users to reduce their demand, so no one has to be completely shut off. Such agreements, formed long before deregulation when PG&E ran the north state's grid, now are complicated by the 1997 creation of the state Independent System Operator. The ISO today runs pieces of the grid owned by PG&E, Edison, and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. If it believes power use is about to surge past supply, potentially triggering a grid collapse across the western United States, the ISO notifies the three utilities that they have to shed a certain number of megawatts. The big utilities meet that requirement two ways. They cut circuits to some of their own customers, and they tell smaller, connected utilities to cut a proportionate share. In Northern California, about 80 percent of the outages are borne by PG&E customers and the rest by customers of SMUD and other municipal utilities and irrigation districts. ""In one sense, we are all in this together. If SMUD were in danger of going down, we would hope others would help us out,"" said SMUD's Posner. ""But that's if we're in danger from circumstances beyond our control, not from mismanagement or lack of financial wherewithal."" It is unclear what penalties, if any, a utility would face for violating an interconnection agreement. In the long run, the issue would be fought either in the courts or before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, grid officials said. As a practical matter, in the seconds when the risk to the grid is greatest, if one utility refused to shed load, the ISO would probably solve to problem by calling on PG&E, Edison or others who are willing to make deeper cutbacks, they said. ---- PUC to Decide Fate Of Utility Workers PG&E, Edison want to trim costs by laying off thousands, cutting service Bernadette Tansey, Chronicle Staff Writer Wednesday, March 7, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle State regulators are set to decide today whether debt-ridden Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison can conserve cash by laying off thousands of workers and letting service standards slip. Union officials who protested the layoffs before the California Public Utilities Commission warn that if the cuts go through, neighborhoods hit by power outages could stay dark for hours, and more customers could face busy signals when they call about their bills. An administrative law judge agreed, advising the commission in February to order the utilities to restore 725 positions already cut and block the elimination of an additional 2,125 jobs. Judge John Wong said PG&E and Edison have acknowledged the layoffs will not substantially improve their shaky financial condition, which arose from skyrocketing wholesale electricity costs the utilities could not pass on to consumers under a rate cap. ""The savings would barely make a dent,"" Wong said in his draft decision. The two companies together claim that their debt from power purchases amounts to more than $13 billion. PG&E says it has saved $18 million from the first wave of 325 layoffs. Wong's recommendation is already running into resistance on the PUC. Commissioner Richard Bilas said the five-member panel should not be micromanaging the utilities in a time of crisis. Bilas has proposed an alternate ruling that would allow the utilities to make the cuts, but provide for PUC monitoring of service in case the commission wants to step in later. ""We're in a situation where the utilities are not collecting the revenues they need to operate, and yet we may be guilty of not letting them cut expenses where they can cut expenses,"" Bilas said. PG&E spokesman Jon Tremayne said savings from the layoffs are helping to keep electricity running and gas flowing. ""It keeps cash in our accounts so we can keep doing day-to-day business,"" Tremayne said. In addition to the 325 positions dropped so far, PG&E is proposing to cut an additional 675 during the next three to six months. The cuts affect temporary and contract workers who read meters, handle new service hookups and replace equipment. PG&E has no plans to eliminate permanent positions. The company is struggling to keep up with a higher workload at its call center as customers deluge the lines with inquiries about their rising bills and the effects of deregulation. Calls to PG&E ballooned from 1.3 million in January 2000 to 2.3 million in January 2001. Bilas advocates granting PG&E's request to temporarily relax standards requiring the utility to respond swiftly to customer calls and to read customers' meters once a month. PG&E wants to read meters bimonthly and send bills based on the estimated use between readings. Discrepancies could be corrected later. Wong called those measures unacceptable. He said customers need to know immediately if their efforts to conserve power are working. Wong also said the utilities' own experts have said the workforce reductions will lengthen the time required to restore power after nonemergency equipment failure. Eric Wolfe, communications director for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 1245, said some customers have already been left without power overnight because PG&E is trying to avoid the use of overtime on nonemergency power outages. ""It hurts a lineman to walk away from the job leaving a customer without power,"" Wolfe said. Tremayne said PG&E is trying to minimize overtime costs, but denied the company has allowed customers to go without power out of financial concerns. He said crews were pulled out when darkness and falling trees made the work too dangerous. ---- Power prices could soar during the summer Posted at 10:35 p.m. PST Tuesday, March 6, 2001 BY STEVE JOHNSON Mercury News Unless Gov. Gray Davis arranges significantly more long-term electricity contracts or persuades people to turn off a lot more lights, California's unpredictable spot market for power could wreak havoc this summer. Even with the 40 long-term deals announced by Davis on Monday, experts interviewed Tuesday said, up to 43 percent of the state's daily needs may have to come from this highly volatile market, in which power is bought within a day of need. That could could prove hugely expensive, because some spot market energy has cost five to six times what it would under the long-term contracts. It's widely expected that consumers ultimately would have to pay that tab, which could amount to billions of dollars. And because that power won't be locked up in contracts, there is no guarantee it will be available when it's needed, which could lead to blackouts, according to a recent report to the California Independent System Operator, which oversees three-fourths of the state's power grid. ``The situation in California could reach catastrophic proportions,'' the report concluded, adding that unless things change dramatically, ``it is a virtual certainty that peak demand will go unmet during many hot summer days.'' Steven Maviglio, Davis' press secretary, conceded Tuesday that the spot market could be troublesome. ``It's a major concern,'' he said, which is why the state is trying to line up more power contracts, speed up power plant construction and promote conservation. During the normally hot month of August, peak daily demand for power in the Independent System Operator's territory is expected to hit about 47,700 megawatts -- enough for nearly 48 million homes. The state's three main utility firms generate about 8,200 megawatts and have long-term contracts from wind, solar and other energy sources for about 11,700 megawatts more. That totals about 20,000 megawatts. Add in the 7,000 megawatts of long-term power that Davis has announced for this summer, and the state is still nearly 21,000 megawatts short. Costly proposition If all that power has to be obtained on the spot market, the price could be high. On Friday, last-minute purchases on the market averaged $411 per megawatt-hour, compared to about $150 per megawatt-hour for all power obtained by the Independent System Operator and $69 per megawatt-hour on average under Davis' long-term contracts. It's possible that not all 21,000 megawatts would have to be purchased on the market. Assuming Davis is successful in getting people to save 10 percent -- which could prove difficult -- conservation could reduce peak demand by nearly 5,000 megawatts. California also might be able to trade for another 5,000 megawatts with the federal government's Bonneville Power Administration and a hydroelectric operator in British Columbia, said Arthur O'Donnell, editor of California Energy Markets, a trade publication. Under such deals, those two outfits often send that much power to California when they don't need it and California returns the same amount or more when its demand is low. But O'Donnell said it wasn't clear whether 5,000 megawatts would be available this summer, because ``they still haven't gotten the snowpack they need in the Pacific Northwest,'' which could limit that region's generating capacity. Still falling short Even if those hydropower imports are available and conservation works as Davis hopes, it's likely California would still require the spot market for 11,000 megawatts to meet the August demand. That's more than 20 percent of the state's overall power needs. ``All of the surrounding states are buying probably less than 5 percent, at most, of their energy on the spot market,'' said Frank Wolak, a Stanford economist, who monitors electricity prices for the Independent System Operator. He worries about how much that power could cost and is disturbed that state officials haven't adequately addressed the issue. ``No one has any idea what they are going to do, and that is part of the problem,'' he said. Officials at Pacific Gas & Electric Co. are particularly concerned. They fear that their company -- which is nearing bankruptcy -- could get stuck for much of the spot market purchases by the Independent System Operator, which has threatened to bill the utilities for the cost. Fearing the annual bill for that power could hit $2.4 billion this year, PG&E wants the tab sent to the Department of Water Resources, which also is buying power on the spot market for the state. But the Department of Water Resources has objected to that idea and the matter is expected to be heard today by the California Public Utilities Commission. ``We're looking for clarity on a number of issues'' regarding how the spot market will work ``and certainly that's one of them,'' said Thomas Hannigan, the water agency's director. ``I don't think anybody knows the answer of who's going to pay for it,'' added PG&E spokesman John Nelson. But Nettie Hoge, executive director of the Utility Reform Network in San Francisco, said she suspects consumers ultimately will foot the bill. The unfortunate likelihood about spot market purchases is that ``ratepayers are responsible for all of it eventually,'' Hoge said. ``It's a very big problem.'' ---- Power Plant Plans Cause Conflicts East county residents blast supervisors Jason B. Johnson, Chronicle Staff Writer Wednesday, March 7, 2001 Industry dreams of building new power plants in east Contra Costa's hills are prompting an angry reaction among residents and elected officials who say they don't want more plants. The conflict was sparked by a vote by county supervisors yesterday to aggressively explore possible sites for new power plants throughout the county. The measure by Supervisors Mark DeSaulnier and Federal Glover, which passed on a 4-to-0 vote, directs the county administrator and Department of Community Development to compile a report on possible sites within 45 days. Supervisor Donna Gerber abstained after criticizing the plan for potentially repeating the same mistakes that plagued the state's energy deregulation effort by not considering how much energy the state, region and county will need in future years, and how much power is slated to come online. Gerber said alternative power sources, such as solar, should also be examined. A site drawing much attention is on top of a deposit of natural gas near the Concord Naval Weapons Station off Highway 4. The owners of 70 acres of land near the station recently formed a company, Golden State Power Co., to pursue construction of at least one small peaker plant and a much larger facility capable of producing 600 megawatts. The site could hold up to three small 50-megawatt peaker plants, and a larger 15-acre natural gas plant, said Steve Thomas, managing partner with Golden State. No land use applications have been filed. Thomas said 30 acres could be kept as open space to form a buffer around the project. ""Both (facilities) are state of the art,"" said Thomas. ""We believe that the site is ideal."" But east county residents at yesterday's meeting blasted the supervisorial measure and the power plant proposal, complaining that more plants could put people's health at risk. The region already is home to six power plants. ""We're going to get a good dose of poor air quality and (negative) health conditions from this,"" said Concord resident Evelyn Frietas. ""I think we need to stop and think about what we're doing to our quality of life."" Dan Torres said the home he bought in 1995 at a new Bay Point development would be alarmingly close to the proposed Golden State site. ""It will be dragging emissions over our home,"" said Torres. ""I didn't buy a home on that hill to be surrounded by power plants."" There are six power plants in operation in east Contra Costa. Pittsburg already has two power plants, and two more under construction. City Council members Frank Aiello and Yvonne Beals said the Antioch-Pittsburg area has done more than its share of energy production. Aiello said Pittsburg will soon produce enough energy to power three million homes in California. ""When is enough, enough?"" asked Aiello. ""Pittsburg has shouldered responsibility for a land-fill and two more power plants. At some point you have to say enough."" Beals said that while power plants have added millions to the city's general fund, the negatives of additional plants could outweigh the benefits. ""I don't think that Pittsburg or east county should be the dumping ground for energy for California,"" said Beals. ---- Supervisors set search for power plant sites The board also heard from the potential developers of a 650-megawatt plant between Bay Point and Concord By Thomas Peele TIMES STAFF WRITER MARTINEZ -- Contra Costa County supervisors took tentative steps Tuesday toward allowing the construction of at least one small power plant before summer, ordering that its staff identify potential sites in unincorporated areas within seven weeks. The board voted 4-0 to search for locations. Third District Supervisor Donna Gerber abstained, saying her colleagues lacked a ""comprehensive context'' to identify sites. ""I think the board knows just enough to be dangerous,'' she said. Gerber said the county should examine the potential for additional power plants within its borders but not investigate individual sites yet. But Fourth District Supervisor Mark DeSaulnier said the action was necessary because of the energy crisis and because of Gov. Gray Davis' call for local governments to help speed the construction of so-called ""peaker plants"" before July and August. ""I wouldn't do this except under an emergency,"" DeSaulnier said after the vote. ""There are unusual circumstances. We're not talking about putting this in a residential area."" Fifth District Supervisor Federal Glover backed DeSaulnier, but said he hoped for a location outside his heavily industrialized East County district. ""There's a lot of concern in East County as to the number of plants,"" he said. DeSaulnier said, though, that the only logical place for a small plant remains the ""industrial belt'' stretching along the waterfront from West County to Antioch. He declined to provide specifics, but said the only other potential site outside the industrial areas was the Concord Naval Weapons Station property. But he quickly added that he believes the U.S. Department of Defense ""would never go for it."" Also, DeSaulnier said he could not rule out the county building the plant itself and entering the electricity-selling market during peak demand times. Board Chairwoman Gayle Uilkema called that idea extremely premature and unlikely. ""That's a very powerful decision. I do not think we are ready,'' she said. The California Energy Commission listed the Equilon refinery in Martinez as one of 32 potential ""peaker plant"" sites in the state last week. Peaker plants kick in during peak usage times. Davis called for their quick construction before the height of summer and its energy demand for air conditioning. Plants that generate as much as 50,000 megawatts don't need Energy Commission approval. DeSaulnier said he believed a peaker plant could be built about a month after final approval. Supervisors also heard from the potential developers of a 650-megawatt plant between Bay Point and Concord. Walnut Creek commercial real estate developer Steve Thomas announced his intentions for the site north of Highway 4 last week. Construction could take two years. Eric Hasseltine, a consultant representing Thomas and what he described as a ""brand new"" company for the site, the Golden State Power Co., told supervisors that if they intended to speed peaker plant construction they should do what they can to expedite the larger plant. The Thomas site could house a peaker plant until the proposed larger one goes online. A large natural gas line passes under the site. DeSaulnier seemed cautious about the larger proposal, which he had described last week as ""a good site."" Uilkema, too, said she knew too little about it to comment. A resident who lives near the Thomas property asked the board to ""build it (the larger plant) closer to where you have industrial areas. You have to carefully consider the people"" who live nearby, said Dan Torres, 39. Evelyn Freitas of Concord said she lives downwind of the proposed site. ""Our air quality is going to be worse then it is now,"" she said. Gerber played on the environmental issues, saying the county already ranks second statewide to Los Angeles in volume of hazardous materials and amount of electrical generation. ---- Peter Schrag: California's $90 billion infrastructure gap (Published March 7, 2001) By now, California's surreal energy mess has grown from a crisis to a condition. It may not be quite as permanent as, say, death and taxes, but it's still something that could get a whole lot worse before it gets better. Until there's more realistic pricing, no gubernatorial pea-under-the-shell buyout scheme will solve it. Beyond the energy crisis, however, and in many ways similar to it, California faces a whole range of other infrastructure problems -- in transportation, in water resources and sewer systems, in school and university buildings -- that seem, once again, to be all but forgotten. The Business Roundtable has estimated the need at roughly $90 billion, though no number can possibly be exact. What's certain is that after a burst of high-level investment in public facilities during the 1950s and 1960s, California's annual capital investment has sunk precipitously -- from an annual $150 per capita in the 1960s, according to a set of recent studies for PPIC, the Public Policy Institute of California, to about $30 in the 1990s. But you probably don't need to tell anyone driving Bay Area or Los Angeles freeways or looking at the ubiquitous portable classrooms, those dreary brown boxes that house a fourth of our public school students. Ever since passage of Proposition 13 in 1978, we have been flying the flag of deferred maintenance. As in the state's electricity crisis, however, there's no way California can effectively address those problems merely by building or bonding itself out of them. In highway construction, in developing water resources, in finding enough university space to accommodate the Tidal Wave II of students, managing demand is likely to be as crucial to any solution as new construction. In the energy market -- and in electricity particularly -- it's been a familiar principle ever since David Roe of the Environmental Defense Fund first persuaded Pacific Gas and Electric that a dollar invested in conservation may be worth as much as the same investment in new generation. But in most other sectors of California's infrastructure, state and local, it's a lesson still to be learned. There have been scattered attempts to encourage conservation and reduce demand -- significant reduction in water use, for example, through the installation of low-flow faucets and low-flush toilets; some reduction in traffic by using rush-hour diamond lanes or by adjusting highway or (as in New York) bridge tolls to levels of congestion. But as pointed out by David Dowall, an urban economist at Berkeley, state policy-makers have not really begun to ""consider how demand management strategies can be applied to infrastructure service areas,"" or how the more efficient use of facilities and more realistic pricing -- highway tolls, say, or parking fees -- ""can reduce demand for scarce infrastructure resources."" In any case, says Dowall in one of the PPIC reports, we should pick which major projects we will build not just according to per capita estimates of how much we need, but according to how much consumers are willing to pay for them. To avoid hurting the poor, congestion-related highway tolls and other tariffs can be rebated on the basis of income. University fees can be means-tested. In California, they also could be adjusted to encourage summer school classes and other off-peak uses, rather than (as in the past) making UC summer courses more expensive. Given the political and economic uncertainties, there's no way to know how far such demand management can be taken. But there's not much doubt that, as Dowall and others point out, the state's infrastructure planning is a jumble of uncoordinated agency agendas and wish lists. The Legislature last year passed a bill, AB 1473, by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, that requires the governor, beginning next year, to submit an annual five-year infrastructure plan for state agencies and public schools, along with recommendations on how to fund it. In addition, Gov. Gray Davis' infrastructure commission is expected to recommend better coordination of infrastructure and land-use planning when it issues its report this spring. That would be a start. As California State Treasurer Phil Angelides has pointed out, the state desperately needs to start joint planning -- regional planning -- for housing, roads and other resources to reduce the need for long commutes; to preserve open space; and to bring jobs to where people live and housing to where the jobs are. That would itself reduce demand for more freeway lanes and, equally important, improve the quality of life. At present, most planning for housing, roads, water systems and other facilities rarely recognizes the regional impact of local decisions. In the East Bay, slow-growth forces push well-intended initiatives that would force more development into Tracy or Modesto and further tax the transportation systems to Silicon Valley. In city after city, there are beggar-thy-neighbor efforts to grab yet another shopping mall that produces a little extra sales tax revenue for the city that gets it, and that often compounds traffic and revenue problems in adjacent communities. In higher education we divide bond proceeds evenly among UC, the California State University and the community colleges even though the community colleges serve eight times as many students as UC. We plan road projects according to county, not regional, priorities. It is all done according to antiquated political and fiscal formulas that often no longer make sense. We don't just need better capital planning; we need a whole new planning system. ---- PG&E power plan debated at hearing A PUC meeting on the utility's capacity expansion project for the Tri-Valley follows weeks of protest from officials, residents Power upgrade in valley debated By Megan Long TIMES STAFF WRITER SAN FRANCISCO -- Dublin officials and the developer of a Livermore subdivision faced questions Tuesday about their opposition to alternative routes of PG&E's controversial Tri-Valley power upgrade plan -- and answered by restating their long-standing objections. Tuesday's cross-examination came during the third and likely final week of the California Public Utility Commission's evidentiary hearings on the utility's $91 million Tri-Valley 2002 Capacity Increase Project. It has followed weeks of protests of PG&E's upgrade plans by officials and residents of Livermore, Pleasanton, Dublin and San Ramon. And before the questioning started, Dublin Vice Mayor Janet Lockhart reiterated concerns about an alternative route deemed ""environmentally superior"" that would place a substation just 1,000 feet north of Interstate 580 between Tassajara and Fallon roads. She said that would undermine the results of a 15-year process to plan the eastern development of the city. ""It's extremely important to the residents of our community to follow a plan we worked hard to produce,"" she said. Dublin officials favor PG&E's proposed placement of the station three miles north of the freeway, away from new high-tech company offices and housing developments. Besides the Dublin substation, the project calls for construction of a substation in North Livermore, expansion of the Pleasanton substation and installation of 23.5 miles of new lines. In response to questions from PUC Administrative Law Judge Michelle Cooke, Dublin's public works director, Lee Thompson, confirmed that the Lin family, the owner of the property where the alternative substation would go, wasn't interested in selling the land to PG&E. Cooke also asked Thompson to define a ""discretionary permit,"" which is how city officials said they might treat a permit for a substation. Lee said that type of permit is one the city has the right to approve or not depending on the project's impact. Eddie Peabody, Dublin's community development director, testified that the zoning for the Lin property accommodates uses such as commercial business, research and development and light manufacturing. It would not, he said, be appropriate for a power substation. He said parcels within the East Dublin area that could host a station would include those zoned for public and semi-public uses, including land recently bought by Oracle and Sun Microsystems for new campuses. While Dublin officials testified that one buyer of land in that area paid $86 per square foot, others suggested land prices would be inflated to help make a PG&E land buy look prohibitively expensive. An executive of Centex Homes, the developer of new houses near Isabel Avenue and Concannon Boulevard, objected to an alternative route that would place high-voltage transmission lines overhead along Isabel and Stanley Boulevard. David Barclay, president of Centex's Northern California division, said that the 80-foot to 150-foot towers would have a severe visual impact on residents of the Prima tract. Ed O'Neill, a lawyer for the Kottinger Ranch Homeowners Association, pointed out that existing distribution lines on 50-foot poles on Isabel already mar the view for residents. The Foley family has been ranching on land south of Pleasanton city limits for years, said their attorney Kennedy Richardson. The utility's project would place overhead lines and a transmission station on rolling hills that the family envisions as one day being public open space with limited development, Richardson said. Lawyers for Pleasanton, Livermore, Kottinger Ranch and Centex are scheduled to cross-examine a PG&E engineer today about the project's routing. That testimony should be the most controversial of the hearings. Judge Cooke is expected to recommend an alignment by July to the PUC, which will make the final decision. ---- NEWS State OKs 'Peaker' Power Plant at SFO / Temporary generator could be sending electricity to 50,000 homes by August Marshall Wilson 03/08/2001 The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL Page A.20 (Copyright 2001) State energy officials yesterday approved plans to build a temporary electrical plant at San Francisco International Airport that should generate enough juice to power 50,000 homes by August. Meeting in Sacramento, the Energy Commission voted 4-0 to give the green light to the gas-fired plant. It will operate during peak summer and winter demand to help the state avoid Stage 3 power alerts and rolling blackouts. Texas-based El Paso Merchant Energy Co. won approval under a new state law mandating speedy, four-month reviews of so-called ""peaker"" plants. It was the only one of seven applications statewide to win approval. The other proposals were withdrawn for various reasons. The 51-megawatt plant, formally called the United Golden Gate Power Project, is scheduled to be built at the northwest corner of the airport near the United Airlines maintenance center. Within the next few weeks El Paso plans to apply to build a 571- megawatt, $400 million plant in the same area, company spokesman Jesse Frederick said. It would undergo a separate review by state energy officials. The small ""peaker"" plant approved yesterday is to generate electricity beginning around Aug. 1 for up to three years. After the end of three years, the plant would be closed or converted to a cleaner-burning system. Under state law, a temporary ""peaker"" plant is permitted to spew more air pollution than a permanent plant. El Paso's temporary plant is to be built next to a co-generation plant operated by United Airlines. It would use existing connections for natural gas and water supplies and tap into existing power transmission lines. Electricity generated by the plant would be pumped into the state's electrical grid, Energy Commission spokesman Gary Fay said. It would also serve as a backup for San Francisco Airport in case of a blackout. No one spoke against the proposed plant at yesterday's commission meeting. The proposal, however, has been criticized by area residents and environmentalists worried about air pollution. Scott Buschman, a professional photographer and San Bruno resident, said yesterday it was unjust that state officials 100 miles away in Sacramento approved a Texas company's proposal to put a power plant on land owned by San Francisco. ""The fact that they approved it without considering the public's concerns, foremost air quality, is very disturbing,"" he said. Fay said the plant complies with clean-air standards. Answering the criticism about the location of yesterday's deliberation, he said three hearings and several workshops were held in communities near the airport.

Davis's Plan To Power California --- State's Outlays for Electricity May Be Hard to Recover Without Rate Increases --- Betting on Long-Term Deals By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Rebecca Smith, Mitchel Benson and John R. Emshwiller 03/08/2001 The Wall Street Journal A1 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Earlier this year, Gov. Gray Davis made what may be the biggest bet in the history of the nation's biggest state: that he could tame an out-of-control electricity market and avoid devastating blackouts without busting the state's budget, antagonizing its consumers or derailing his own political career. His wager is still on the table, but the assumptions that underlie it are looking increasingly shaky these days. The governor has already spent around $2 billion of public money buying hugely expensive wholesale power, taking over the role formerly played by the state's near-bankrupt electric utilities. And California will probably be obliged to spend billions more before its electricity market stabilizes and those utilities are restored to some semblance of financial health. Under the governor's plan, California aims to recoup the money it is using to buy electricity by issuing $10 billion in bonds. That way it would still have a healthy budget surplus to finance new spending on roads, schools and other public services. But there's a potentially big obstacle to this plan. The state Legislature, worried about racking up billions in new debt, has put limits on the size of any bond offering. In broad terms, the Legislature's action would allow the state to borrow only four times as much as it can recover annually from utility customers. Right now that doesn't appear to be much. Under the current rate structure, essentially set in place by California's flawed 1996 electricity-deregulation plan, consumers pay far less for power than the cost of acquiring it on the wholesale market. Preliminary estimates submitted by utilities last month to the California Public Utilities Commission show the state's share of the proceeds from electricity sales this year could be as little as $241 million -- not enough to support even $1 billion in bond sales under the Legislature's formula. That would leave the state on the hook for much of the money it has already paid for power -- not to mention the billions more Gov. Davis will need to spend. That, in turn, raises the prospect that California's economy and its credit rating both could deteriorate significantly. But state finance officials say that, based on their own projections, they will be able to extract enough money to support a $10 billion bond issue. Walking a careful line between fiscal prudence and political survival, Mr. Davis and others in his administration are scrambling to come up with ways to get around the legislative restrictions without raising rates for consumers. ""If I wanted to raise rates, I could solve this problem in 20 minutes,"" Mr. Davis says. The governor says he believes that the state can obtain enough affordable power through long-term power-supply contracts to avoid the need for a big rate increase. The billions of dollars the state hopes to borrow would be used to help pay for power until electricity prices drop, as they are expected to do when new power plants come online over the next few years. The Davis administration fears that what may be its only other option -- a big increase in retail electric rates -- could prompt angry consumer groups to seek new electricity laws through a statewide ballot initiative during next year's election. That's when Mr. Davis is expected to run for a second term as governor. But trying to save California without rate increases is forcing Mr. Davis to make some colossal gambles with the state's money. State officials estimate that in the next several months, California will need to spend as much as $6 billion on power purchases -- equivalent to the state's entire fiscal surplus. Mr. Davis is also looking to spend several billion more to buy the transmission assets of three investor-owned utilities in order to restore two of them to credit-worthiness. He also has announced plans to spend several hundred million dollars more on conservation programs designed to reduce demand while new power plants are being built in the state. In order to limit the state's financial exposure in the meantime, the governor and his aides have, in some cases, ignored state law. They have threatened appointed officials who have stood in the way. And they have sharply restricted the flow of information to the public. None of those steps is expected to do much to reduce state spending on power in the coming months. In a few weeks, power usage is expected to begin a sharp seasonal rise as Californians switch on their air conditioners with the coming of warmer weather. By various estimates, demand during peak periods this summer could outstrip supply by 10%, or several thousand megawatts. That could produce more rolling blackouts like the ones that hit Northern California earlier this year. It is also likely to put strong upward pressure on wholesale electricity prices. Steven Zimmerman, managing director of Standard & Poor's Corp., says Mr. Davis and his aides don't ""have a lot of time"" to put a cap on the state's financial exposure to the crisis. The credit-rating agency has put the state on credit watch for a possible downgrade, which would affect the value of all of California's outstanding public debt. Moody's Investor Service Inc. is also concerned. It said in a recent report that the power crisis could soon ""seriously threaten the health"" of the state's economy. Mr. Davis, a Democrat and career politician, was dealt a bad hand when he took office in 1999. The deregulation plan that sparked the state's electricity crisis was enacted under his predecessor, Republican Pete Wilson. But Mr. Davis was slow to react to early signs of trouble this past summer and alarms sounded by members of the state Legislature. By the time Mr. Davis finally sprang into action earlier this year, a troublesome power-supply squeeze had escalated into a crisis. In a Jan. 17 declaration of emergency, the governor designated the state Department of Water Resources to take the utilities' place as the daily buyer of huge quantities of electricity. His hope: that by making the state the dominant player in California's power sector, he would ease electricity producers' concerns about getting paid and give the state enough clout to negotiate lower long-term power prices. Earlier this week, Mr. Davis announced final or tentative agreements with 20 power suppliers to furnish the state with a total of 8,900 megawatts for periods of as long as 20 years. But the supply situation remains extremely uncertain for this summer, when demand probably will top 45,000 megawatts. If the state can secure enough power under contract and push down demand through aggressive conservation, it might be able to squeak through the summer season. If not, it will be forced to keep buying huge amounts of costly power in the cash market. Under deregulation, retail electric rates were frozen for several years, while wholesale-power costs were free to fluctuate. When the plan was conceived, wholesale prices were low and expected to go lower. However, a combination of unexpected growth in power demand and a lack of new generating capacity helped produce a supply squeeze. Average wholesale prices more than tripled last year from 1999. And in January those prices were up 10-fold from a year earlier. By then, California's two biggest investor-owned utilities -- the Pacific Gas & Electric unit of PG&E Corp. and the Southern California Edison subsidiary of Edison International -- faced imminent financial collapse. They had racked up billions of dollars in wholesale power bills they couldn't afford to pay. As generators began shying away from selling to the two utilities, the Clinton administration forced them to sell power into the California market, an order left in place during the first weeks of the Bush administration. Still, northern California was hit by rolling blackouts on several days in early January. Since then, the DWR, which does some electricity trading as an adjunct to its main mission of managing the state's giant system of aqueducts and reservoirs, has had to learn the ins and outs of power markets on the run. It hasn't been easy. David Mills, trading-floor manager for the federal Bonneville Power Administration, says the water agency has at times offered to pay $50 to $100 per megawatt hour more than the available market price. ""They agree to prices that make you wonder,"" says Mr. Mills, whose organization markets electricity from federal dams in the Pacific Northwest. ""You'd at least think they'd check to see what the prevailing price is before throwing out their offer."" Mr. Mills says that ""to cut California some slack,"" he occasionally has instructed his traders to sell at prices lower than the DWR had offered to pay. Ray Hart, the water agency deputy director responsible for the power purchasing, says he isn't aware of any cases in which the DWR has overpaid. He says his team has been ""extremely successful by all measures."" Ultimately, the DWR's trading acumen is far less important than the overall arithmetic of power supply and demand in California. With the price of natural gas that feeds many of the region's generating plants at near record levels and some suppliers reluctant to sell into the troubled California market, wholesale electric prices remain stubbornly high and, in recent days, have again been rising. The Legislature has advanced the DWR about $3 billion from the state's general fund for power purchases. Under emergency legislation passed by the Legislature and signed by Mr. Davis on Feb. 1, the general fund is to be reimbursed from a planned bond sale later this year. But under terms of the emergency law, the water agency would have to wrest $2.5 billion a year in revenue from retail electricity rates in order to sell the $10 billion worth of bonds sought by Mr. Davis. Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, a Southern California Democrat, says the formula was created to ensure that there would be a way to repay the bonds without draining the state's coffers. ""We didn't want to just open our wallets,"" he says. According to the language of the Feb. 1 law, the water agency gets what's left of revenue collected from ratepayers after the utilities pay certain of their own power-supply bills and other expenses. And, in their filings with the PUC last month, the utilities reckoned, under their worst-case scenarios, that there would be only $241 million available to the DWR this year. State officials are quietly pushing the PUC to rejigger the formula so that the water department gets more money -- even though that would clash with terms of the Feb. 1 law. Robert Miyashiro, deputy director of the Department of Finance, says the emergency law was ""drafted poorly"" and has led people to believe the DWR ""only gets the leftover money."" He predicts there will be ""cleanup legislation."" At the request of the Davis administration, the PUC is considering a plan to use a different revenue-sharing formula than the one in the state law. The proposed new formula was written ""in close consultation"" with Mr. Davis's Finance Department, says PUC President Loretta Lynch, who supports the initiative and is hoping to rush it through. The effort has drawn some opposition. Commissioner Richard Bilas at a recent PUC meeting questioned the legality of the commission attempting to change a formula set by the Legislature. PG&E is even more emphatic, since the DWR's extra money could come at the utility's expense. The formula ""threatens to undo the very financial protections for the utilities that [the new law] attempted to provide,"" the utility said in a recent filing with the PUC. As politicians and regulators wrestle with that issue, the Davis administration has taken a step to reduce the outflow of state cash that also seems to conflict with the Feb. 1 law. It was widely assumed that the law required the DWR to buy any electricity the state needed to keep its lights on. However, on many occasions, the DWR has refused to buy power on the grounds that it was too expensive, citing a portion of the new law that urges the agency to hold down costs. The task of covering any remaining shortfall has passed to the California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's energy grid and is charged with buying power when necessary to avert shortages. However, the ISO doesn't have any power-purchasing money of its own, and the major parties it would normally bill are PG&E and Edison, whose inability to pay their power bills was the reason the state started buying electricity in the first place. Amid criticism of its stance from generators, utilities and Wall Street, the DWR says it has started covering more of the utilities' electricity costs. The water agency is now buying 95% to 99% of what California needs in a given day, says the agency's Mr. Hart. But increased buying only adds to the uncertainty about the eventual tab. The state's legislative analyst, Elizabeth Hill, recently recommended that lawmakers hold off considering more than $2 billion in state spending on items ranging from college construction to beach cleanups because of continuing questions about the financial impact of the electricity crisis. Like others, Ms. Hill complains that the governor's office and state agencies haven't been forthcoming with information. Indeed, the DWR refuses to say precisely how much power it is purchasing and at what prices, though it has on several occasions gone back to the Legislature for more money. State officials say that data on its purchasing activities would give suppliers an advantage in continuing electricity-supply contract talks. State Controller Kathleen Connell, who is running for mayor of Los Angeles in an April election, recently announced plans to post state power-spending information on her department's Web site. But within 24 hours, Ms. Connell suspended that plan after discussions with senior Davis administration officials. ""I feel very strongly that this information should be publicly released,"" says Ms. Connell. ""I just don't want to do anything that would weaken the state's effectiveness in negotiating."" In an effort to more tightly control events, the governor obtained legislative approval to abolish the 26-member ISO board, which was made up of everyone from utility executives to representatives of consumer groups. He then appointed a new five-member board. To ensure a quick transition, the California attorney general threatened the old board members with fines of as much as $5,000 each if they didn't immediately relinquish their positions. All did. ""I was offended"" at the ""heavy-handed"" treatment, says Karen Johanson, a former ISO board member. One of the first acts of the ISO's new board was to close a meeting about the electricity crisis. The former ISO board routinely held such meetings in public. ISO attorneys say the meeting was largely designed as a private briefing for new board members and that the organization is committed to keeping its deliberations as open as possible. The Wall Street Journal and other news organizations have unsuccessfully challenged the closure in Sacramento state court. Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

From March 2000 to February 2001, natural gas prices have risen 489 percent compared to a 266 percent increase in New Mexico and a 247 percent jump in Chicago. ??Steinberg asked Ralph Eads, the president of an El Paso Natural Gas Co. subsidiary, for an explanation. ??""The 275 percent difference you say is attributable completely to constraints on the pipeline and demand?"" Steinberg asked. ??""Yes,"" Eads replied. Eads said the state's energy crisis, which led power plants to run harder and longer, dramatically increased demand for natural gas over the summer and a winter with temperatures about 15 percent cooler than the year before exacerbated the problem. ??In another twist to California's deregulation nightmare, El Paso officials said they gained greater control of the pipeline after the Pacific Gas & Electric Co. relinquished the capacity four years ago. At that time, PG&E's movement of the gas and the prices it could charge were regulated by the Public Utilities Commission. ??In other developments at the Capitol on Thursday, lawmakers called on the federal government to re- regulate natural gas sales at the California border and U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., said federal regulators should impose price caps on California's wholesale electricity market. ??The Assembly held considerable debate on the resolution asking for re-regulation, with Democrats accusing President George W. Bush of doing nothing to come to the aid of California and Republicans defending the administration. ??""I'm learning an interesting lesson that all the problems of the world started after Jan. 21 and the inauguration of the new president,"" said Assemblyman Bill Leonard, R-San Bernardino. ??KRT CALIFORNIA is a premium service of Knight Ridder/Tribune ??(c) 2001, Contra Costa Times (Walnut Creek, Calif.). ??Visit the Contra Costa Times on the Web at http://www.cctimes.com/ JOURNAL-CODE: CC LOAD-DATE: April 20, 2001 of 78 DOCUMENTS 2001 / Los Angeles Times Angeles Times ?????????????????????April 20, 2001, Friday, Home Edition SECTION: Part A; Part 1; Page 3; Metro Desk LENGTH: 715 words HEADLINE: CALIFORNIA AND THE WEST; A U-TURN ON CAR TAX REBATES; LEGISLATION: STARTING JULY 1, FEE REDUCTION WILL BE FIGURED DIRECTLY INTO VEHICLE REGISTRATION BILLS, NOT REFUNDED BY MAIL. BYLINE: CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Gov. Gray Davis and the Legislature spun a U-turn Thursday and scrapped a costly program that requires motorists to first pay their car tax and then get a rebate in the mail. ??Starting July 1, the state Department of Motor Vehicles will send owners of approximately 26 million vehicles registration renewal bills already reduced by the amount of the vehicle license fee rebates. ??On a unanimous roll call, the Senate voted final approval and sent to Davis an ""urgency"" bill, SB 52, that repealed the rebate program, which the governor had previously fought for and defended. ??In addition to abolishing the rebates, the legislation reduces by 67.5% the amount motorists must pay for the upcoming year, the level that lawmakers and former Gov. Pete Wilson envisioned in 1998 when they began cutting the fee. It had been about 2% of a vehicle's market value. ??Davis immediately signed the repeal bill, saying only that the new law will ""expedite relief to taxpayers and greatly reduce administrative costs."" ??The governor's muted observation contrasted with his effusive support of the rebates last year, when he said Californians ""don't appreciate the fact that they're getting a rebate unless they see it in their hands."" ??At the time, Davis and the Legislature had the choice of simply cutting the car tax, which voters might not notice, or sending checks in the mail, which Davis felt would have a greater impact. ??The rebates, which began Jan. 1, were scheduled to continue through 2002, when Davis intends to run for reelection. In 2003, the license fee was to have fallen permanently, with no more rebates. ??""The whole rebate scheme was good only through the next gubernatorial election cycle,"" said Sen. Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks), who supported reductions in the license fee but opposed the rebates. ??Until July 1, the DMV will continue to bill motorists for the full amount of their license fee, which includes a 35% reduction from last year. ??""Then we return to you an additional 32.5% rebate, making a total reduction of 67.5%,"" said DMV spokesman Bill Branch. Starting with license renewals on July 1, the DMV bills will include the full tax cut. ??A Senate analysis of the repeal bill noted that the current ""awkward system . . . effectively requires taxpayers to overpay their vehicle license fee and then await a rebate check from the state--a system that is, at best, difficult to explain."" ??But as the California economy tightened, the state's budget surplus shrank and taxpayers shelled out approximately $ 50 million a day to buy electricity, the costs of the rebate program threatened to become a political embarrassment to Davis. ??Projected administrative and postage costs of the rebate program alone were estimated at $ 22 million this year and another $ 22 million or so next year. ??Last year, state Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) and McClintock sought to eliminate the rebates and give drivers their full tax cuts when they register their vehicles. Under pressure from Davis, the bill failed. ??""It was killed behind the scenes at the insistence of the governor,"" McClintock said Thursday.

LOPEZ and RICH CONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS BODY: ??California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer, ratcheting up his investigation of possible civil and criminal violations by the state's power suppliers, is asking a San Francisco judge to order two firms to hand over confidential records. ??In a motion filed Thursday in Superior Court, Lockyer said Reliant Energy and Mirant Corp. have failed to comply with subpoenas for documents that were to be produced by March 19. ??Amid soaring electricity costs and rolling blackouts, the attorney general launched an investigation of possible manipulation of wholesale electricity prices that have skyrocketed to record levels and have financially crippled the state's major utilities. ??Dozens of other public and private power suppliers are complying with the subpoenas. ??But in an interview, Lockyer accused Reliant and Mirant of stonewalling investigators ""so they can keep enjoying these exorbitant profits and prices for as long as possible."" ??Ultimately, the companies will have to honor the subpoenas, he said. ""I'm going to pit bull them,"" he said. ""This is one we win."" ??Both companies say they have done nothing wrong and played by the rules of California's flawed electricity deregulation plan. ??A spokesman for Houston-based Reliant said Thursday the firm is seeking court action of its own to ensure that sensitive business information will not be shared with other public agencies or its competitors. ??Last week, Reliant asked a Los Angeles Superior Court judge to clarify the attorney general's obligation to keep proprietary information confidential. ??""We're glad to cooperate with his investigation to the extent we can,"" said Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley. "" But we have not received sufficient assurances that Lockyer would keep the data confidential."" ??Lockyer called Reliant's court filing ""frivolous"" and ""propagandistic"" and insisted that adequate safeguards are in place. He reserves the right under state law to share information with other government agencies aiding in his investigation but has said he will keep sensitive business information from being made public. ??Atlanta-based Mirant demanded and received similar guarantees of confidentiality, Lockyer said. Mirant did not return phones calls Thursday. ??Lockyer did not discuss details of the probe or the kinds of information he's seeking. But based on the investigation so far, he said, ""it's beginning to get interesting."" ??Other records indicate that the attorney general has sought 91 categories of information about the power merchants' activities.

S. MUST STEP IN TO PROTECT STATE FROM MANIPULATION BY SUPPLIERS. BYLINE: MITCHELL LANDSBERG and MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS BODY: ??This may be the surest sign yet of the depth of California's energy crisis: A bipartisan cross-section of the state's congressional delegation, brought together Thursday by Gov. Gray Davis, not only agreed about the severity of the problem but also about the need for swift federal intervention. ??""This meeting did not have the word 'Democrat' or 'Republican' used once,"" Rep. Darrell E. Issa (R-Vista), said of the unusual spirit of cooperation at the meeting near Los Angeles International airport. ??Members of both parties said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must slash wholesale electricity prices so California utilities can once again afford to buy power. Since January, the state government has been buying electricity on their behalf, as skyrocketing wholesale prices put Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison billions of dollars into debt and many power suppliers refused to sell to them; PG&E has since filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. ??Although the Bush administration has said repeatedly that it is strongly opposed to price caps, and FERC has refused to grant them, California Republicans at the energy meeting said they are optimistic that the administration will agree to some other form of price regulation. They brushed aside the notion that such regulations might conflict with their ideological belief in a free market. ??""This is not a free-enterprise situation,"" Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Alpine) said after the meeting. ""In fact, it's just the opposite."" ??Specifically citing the huge disparity between natural gas prices charged to California and those charged in other Western states, he said California clearly has been the victim of unreasonably high energy costs. Under federal law, the FERC must regulate the prices of companies if it finds they are exerting ""market power"" to drive prices to unreasonable levels. ??Executives from two Texas energy companies, meeting with legislators in Sacramento, denied Thursday that they had caused natural gas prices in California to artificially skyrocket by hoarding access to a critical pipeline into the state. ??After the extraordinary meeting in Los Los Angeles, Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) said the biggest disagreement between California Democrats and Republicans appeared to be their relative faith--or lack thereof--in the ability of President Bush and his administration to help California. There has been much speculation that Bush, who lost California in November, has no political motive to help the state. ??""We Democrats,"" said Sherman, ""hope very much that our skepticism is proven wrong."" ??Davis--who sat flanked by Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and the governor's newly appointed chief energy advisor, S. David Freeman--said he used the meeting mainly to discuss the importance of conservation by Californians this summer and to ask the congressional delegation to pitch in. Five Republicans and more than a dozen Democrats attended the gathering. ??Feinstein said Thursday that she has asked for a third time to meet with Bush to discuss the energy situation. Meeting with Times reporters and editors Wednesday, she described a recent meeting with Vice President Dick Cheney in which, she said, he ""ignored"" her appeal for federal assistance. ??Feinstein has been among those critical of natural gas companies, saying they appear to have constricted access to a California-bound pipeline to run up prices. ??The Brattle Group, a respected consulting firm, alleged Wednesday before an Assembly committee that Dynegy Inc. and El Paso Natural Gas Co. had manipulated the market by charging so much for the rights to their pipeline capacity that they had, in effect, withheld access to it. ??That action, the experts said, directly forced companies trying to deliver gas to California to look for alternatives, clogging other pipelines and causing a surge in prices. ??The explanation, El Paso executives said, was simple: Demand for gas soared in California because generators that use gas to make electricity increased production last year in response to the energy crisis. ??""We're not withholding capacity--no one is,"" said El Paso Merchant Energy President Ralph Eads. ""With these prices, you want to sell every molecule."" ??In other developments Thursday: ??* The agreement between Davis and Edison International to return its ailing utility arm to financial health is in ""deep trouble and could be rejected by legislators,"" the Standard & Poor's credit rating agency said in a note to clients, citing legislative and other sources. A rejection of the deal ""would be a humiliating setback for the governor,"" S&P said. ??The agreement calls for, among other things, the sale of Edison's transmission grid to the state for $ 2.76 billion and the sale of $ 2 billion in bonds--both designed to pay off the utility's huge electricity debt. Edison agreed to several constraints, including the sale of electricity to the state at prices tied to the cost of producing power. ??Since they returned Monday from a two-week recess, state legislators have been sharply critical of the Edison agreement and have indicated a desire to tinker with aspects of the deal. Some lawmakers have said publicly that a bankruptcy protection filing by Edison, like that of PG&E, might not be such a dire outcome. ??But a senior Edison executive said it is ""way too early"" to give up on passage of the proposal, which legislators have not yet seen in official form. ??""There is an education process to do here,"" the executive said of the highly detailed 38-page document. ""The legislators should be asking questions. That is appropriate."" ??* The Public Utilities Commission voted to investigate whether alternative energy providers violated contractual agreements by withholding supplies from PG&E and Edison, which owe them hundreds of millions of dollars. ??The action, Commissioner Carl W. Wood said, was prompted in part by lawsuits some providers have filed seeking release from their contracts with the cash-starved utilities. The producers of solar, wind and geothermal energy account for more than 25% of California's electricity supply. ??""The question is whether we will be able to rely on them in the long, hot days of summer,"" Wood said. ??Jack Raudy of the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee said the PUC needs to address the $ 700 million the producers are owed. ""All we have gotten is rhetoric from the governor, the PUC and the utilities,"" he said. ??* An $ 850-million plan to entice Californians to conserve precious megawatts appears to be running into roadblocks, compounding predictions by state officials of tighter than expected energy supplies in May and June. ??Davis signed the conservation spending package last week, earmarking $ 242 million of the new funds for the Public Utilities Commission to distribute to the state's investor-owned utilities to support existing conservation programs. ??But Barbara Hale, director of the PUC's Division of Strategic Planning, said Thursday that since Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy protection April 6, the utility has stopped releasing conservation funds. ??Hale, testifying before a state Senate committee, said PG&E's decision--coupled with the threat that Southern California Edison could follow a similar route to U.S. Bankruptcy Court--has complicated her agency's efforts. ??PG&E spokeswoman Staci Homrig said her company plans to petition the Bankruptcy Court to have the conservation funds designated as a trust and separated from assets tied up in the bankruptcy proceedings. She said if the court denies the request, PG&E would ask to be permitted to pay the expenses anyway. The process, she added, could take about a month--too long in the view of some legislators, given increasingly gloomy energy forecasts for late spring and early summer. ??Deputy Director Bob Therkelsen of the California Energy Commission said his agency had been counting on a number of small power producers to bolster their output during that period. But he said some producers did not purchase the necessary equipment because PG&E and Edison have failed to pay them in full for earlier electricity deliveries. ??""It's not a huge amount,"" he said of the anticipated production shortfall, ""but every little bit helps."" ??* ??Landsberg reported from Los Angeles, Bustillo from Sacramento.

There is some willingness, they say, to consider some price controls, even though the Bush administration is adamantly opposed to such measures. ??Many are looking to see if President Bush's choices for the two vacancies on FERC will provide a margin for change. ??But the commission's basic philosophy that open, unregulated markets are best is not likely to change soon, members say. ??""I've been championing a revamping of FERC's antiquated standards for determining market-based rates,"" Commissioner Richard Massey said Thursday. But with no success. "" My agency is not on the verge of turning on a dime on this market-based pricing."" ??The standards are a joke, Massey added, because the commission never turns down requests for such pricing authority. More than 600 power sellers have been given that authority, he said. ??For a power company to be allowed to charge whatever the market will bear, it must show FERC, for example, that it doesn't have the power to manipulate the market and drive prices up. ??""Any seller that can't pass our screen needs to fire their consultants and lawyers,"" Massey said. ??While the overall philosophy remains consistent, FERC staff has proposed to the commission that a Stage 3 electricity emergency in California should trigger cost-based rates, a form of price controls. Such triggers would be in place for one year, under the staff proposal. ??The commission may decide Wednesday whether to accept that proposal. It has to make some decision by May 1 on how the market will be monitored from now on. ??The theory behind controlling prices in Stage 3, says a FERC staff report, is that during such an emergency generators have the greatest opportunity to manipulate the market and drive prices up. ??But generators have that power during Stage 2 and Stage 1 emergencies, says Les Starck, Southern California Edison Co.'s manager of federal regulatory affairs. Price caps during Stage 3 might avert the rolling blackouts associated with that level of crisis, but they wouldn't do anything to stop generators from jacking up prices the rest of the time, he said. ??It is not clear how long it would take for such price controls to take effect, should the commission go along with the staff recommendation. ??""We're close because summer is approaching,"" Commissioner Linda Breathitt said Thursday. Breathitt, who had firmly opposed any form of price controls, said in an interview last month that given the worsening crisis in California she was open to considering some short-term measures. ??""It's important to me that we address the summer,"" Breathitt said, but said she wasn't able to predict what the commission would do Wednesday. ??Even if an order is approved, Massey said, there could be delays while the power sellers file their costs with regulators and disputes over those filings are handled. ??Sen. Dianne Feinstein said Thursday such a move by the commission would be ""better than having no controls at all. There's no question that we're going to be in a Stage 3 emergency."" ??Feinstein, D-Calif., and other Western lawmakers have been urging FERC to step in sooner and with price controls that extend beyond just the emergency period. ??Waiting for Stage 3 to intervene ""is putting the whole grid at risk,"" said Roger Hamilton, a member of Oregon's Public Utility Commission. ""We have a real stability problem when you cut it that close."" ??Feinstein says the future could well rest with the new commissioners, particularly Patrick Wood, the head of the Texas PUC who many believe will replace Curt Heber as FERC chairman if he is confirmed by the Senate. ??Even if Massey and Breathitt agree on broader price controls, as chairman, Heber could block consideration of such a move. It's unclear what stance Wood would take as chairman. ??""The thing that deeply concerns me about Pat Wood is that he's from Texas,"" Feinstein said. ""What's reassuring is that it appears from my personal discussion with him is that he appears to be pragmatic."" ??But once again, timing could be a problem. ??Bush has said he intends to nominate Wood and Nora Brownell, a member of the Pennsylvania PUC, but has not formally sent their nominations to the Senate. ??""The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is of vital importance right now, and to let the time go on without filling the spots makes no sense,"" Feinstein said. ""Please please please, President Bush, process your nominees."" ??KRT CALIFORNIA is a premium service of Knight Ridder/Tribune ??(c) 2001, The Orange County Register (Santa Ana, Calif.). ??Visit the Register on the World Wide Web at http://www.ocregister.com/ JOURNAL-CODE: OC LOAD-DATE: April 20, 2001 of 78 DOCUMENTS ??????????????Copyright 2001 Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service ???????????????????????Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service Jose Mercury News 20, 2001, Friday SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS KR-ACC-NO: ?K512 LENGTH: 696 words HEADLINE: In response to power woes, rating agencies have California on credit watch BYLINE: By Jennifer Bjorhus BODY: ??SAN JOSE, Calif. _ All three of the nation's influential judges of credit risk now have California on credit watch, saying they are deeply concerned about the economic impact of the state's power crisis. ??The Fitch credit rating agency made it unanimous Wednesday when it warned that the thickening electricity quagmire, as well as lower than expected tax revenues in February and March, could spell broader risk for the state's budget. ??The announcement is a signal that Fitch, too, may downgrade its ratings on California's nearly $30 billion in public debt, a move which could cost taxpayers millions. ??The announcement comes as state lawmakers mull a bailout plan for Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. sits in bankruptcy and state officials bleed through the state's general fund as they purchase expensive electricity for consumers. Earlier this week, Gov. Gray Davis announced that the average daily bill for electricity purchases has risen from $45.8 million a day in the last week of March, to $73 million a day. ??Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's have already issued their own credit warnings, although none of the three agencies has actually downgraded the state's very good double-A credit rating. ??Bond ratings are important yardsticks that bankers and investors use to price municipal and corporate bonds. A downgrade would force California to offer bondbuyers higher interest rates going forward, costing taxpayers. ??The state was last at a lower A rating back in 1994. ??Moody's changed California's Aa2 general obligation bond rating outlook from stable to negative on April 6, the day Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy. Standard & Poor's has had the state's AA rating outlook at negative since January, when the state began buying electricity for the utilities. ??The deciding factor for Fitch, said Fitch vice chairman Claire Cohen, was the disagreement over how the money from the new electricity rate hike will be spent. ??The California Public Utilities Commission ruled in late March that money generated by higher electricity bills should go first to pay the state Department of Water Resources, which has been buying electricity for the utilities. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. has argued that if the state is paid first, there won't be any money left for it. ??The utility is formally challenging the PUC decision, and the move threatens to hold up the estimated $12 billion to $14 billion of bonds the Department of Water Resources plans to issue to buy more electricity. ??""With that being appealed you don't have a clean authorization,"" Cohen said. ""It signals to me that it could delay the financing process."" ??A second concern is that the state isn't collecting as much in taxes as expected, Cohen said. Tax collections for both February and March were below forecast. The amount of personal income tax the state collected in those months fell short by $455 million, or 14% less than expected. ??Cohen said she made her decision before hearing that the state's power costs now exceed $70 million a day. Cohen and David Hitchcock, the California analyst for Standard & Poors, agreed those rising costs are a definite concern. ??""It doesn't take much of a change in economic growth to make some of these projected fund balances disappear and so we're very worried about what the current economic activity is, particularly in Northern California with some of the problems with the high tech area,"" Hitchcock told analysts and investors last week in a conference call. ??State treasurer Phillip Angelides was traveling Thursday and couldn't be reached for comment. Other economy-watchers expressed concern. ??Sandy Harrison, assistant director of the state Dept. of Finance, said the move reinforced the importance of solving the current power problems soon. ??""It's important to note that the rating hasn't been lowered yet and does remain very strong,"" he said. ??KRT CALIFORNIA is a premium service of Knight Ridder/Tribune ??(c) 2001, San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.). ??Visit Mercury Center, the World Wide Web site of the Mercury News, at http://www.sjmercury.com/ JOURNAL-CODE: SJ LOAD-DATE: April 20, 2001 of 78 DOCUMENTS ??????????????Copyright 2001 Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service ???????????????????????Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service Jose Mercury News 20, 2001, Friday SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS KR-ACC-NO: ?K520 LENGTH: 1069 words HEADLINE: Issues still remain on what power consumers will eventually pay BYLINE: By John Woolfolk and Michael Bazeley BODY: ??SAN JOSE, Calif. _ State regulators last month announced an electric rate increase that would average a whopping three cents per kilowatt hour, hit bills beginning in May and punish power pigs while sparing energy misers. ??Now, much of that is up in the air. ??Higher rates are surely coming _ but not before June. Exactly which consumers and businesses will pay how much is uncertain as regulators rush to forge a rate structure from a tangle of more than 20 proposals. ??Their task has been complicated immeasurably by Gov. Gray Davis' decision to weigh in with a competing rate plan and Pacific Gas & Electric's move into bankruptcy court. ??""Little details are moving billions of dollars around,"" said Nettie Hoge of consumer advocate group TURN. ??All the proposals assume a ""tiered"" structure that forces the heaviest users of energy to pay the most. But key details yet to be decided mean consumers could see their average rates go up anywhere from 7 percent to 30 percent or more. ??Among them: ??_How much of an overall increase? The Public Utilities Commission approved a 3-cent per kilowatt hour increase last month, which would boost utility revenue $4.8 million. Gov. Gray Davis' hike _ left vague in Davis' April 5 television address _ averages 2.8 cents for PG&E customers but only 2.3 cents for customers of Southern California Edison. ??_What regions of the state will pay? The commission agreed to raise rates only for Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison, but Davis would include the additional 1.2 million San Diego Gas & Electric customers. ??_Should heavier users of electricity subsidize those who are exempt from the new rate increase? If so, those users will find themselves paying much more than any of the average increase figures being tossed about. ??_How will utilities bill customers retroactively for the increase? At the time of the PUC vote on March 27, commissioner said their increase would take effect immediately. ??Various plans are being presented this week to an administrative law judge working for the commission. The judge is expected to recommend a rate structure to the PUC on May 4. Public hearings would follow May 7-11, and the commission would vote on a plan May 14, condensing to a few weeks a process that normally lasts nearly a year. ??Each of the major proposals before the commission assumes that residential customers using less than 130 percent of their baseline would be exempt from higher rates. That's mandated under a new law that allows the state to buy power. Customers already pay higher rates for exceeding their baseline, which is the average basic level of use for each region of the state. ??Each major proposal also sets new ""tiers"" with progressively higher rates for ""medium"" use at 130 to 200 percent of baseline and ""heavy"" use over 200 percent of that level. ??But that's where the similarities end. ??The first distinction among the leading plans comes in the form of an assumption: How many residential customers will avoid any increase because they don't exceed 130 percent of their baseline? Davis says more than half, commissioners say a little under half and PG&E says less than a third. ??The second difference among the plans is a real difference: What happens to everyone else? ??Under the plan by utilities commission President Loretta Lynch, medium PG&E users would see average bills rise 9 percent and heavy users would see bills increase 36 percent. ??Davis' plan says medium PG&E users would see average bills rise 11 percent while heavy users would pay 37 percent more. But the average total bill increase for PG&E residential customers, including those who are exempt, would be 20 percent under his plan and 24 percent under Lynch's, according to a statement on the governor's web site. ??Business customers would see proportionately greater increases, averaging 30 percent under Lynch's proposal and 26 percent under Davis'. ??The most consumer-friendly of the various proposals comes from consumer-rights group TURN. They suggest an overall average residential increase of just 7.5 percent. ??TURN's plan assumes utilities cannot charge other customers more to make up for the energy misers shielded from rate increases under state law. ??PG&E disagrees with that interpretation. The utility wants other residential users to make up for any lost revenue from exempted customers through higher rates. Under the utility's plan, residential customers would see an average rate hike of nearly 30 percent. ??""The proposal these folks are pushing rips the heart out of that law,"" said Matthew Freedman, staff attorney for TURN. ??Another issue affecting consumers is how the utilities can bill for electricity used in April and May, before the final plan is approved. ??Utility officials have objected to making the rate structure retroactive. Instead, to recoup the revenue, they are proposing a flat surcharge that everyone would pay, regardless of how much they use. ??Edison proposes a higher surcharge added to bills for a shorter period of time _ in this case, June through August. PG&E officials are suggesting a smaller surcharge that would be spread out over 12 months. ??""It'll probably be something closer to the PG&E proposal,"" Paul Clanon, the commission's director of energy issues. ??All the rate increase proposals stem from a commonly understood problem: California's current, frozen rates don't generate enough money to cover the wholesale price of power. The PUC raised rates 10 percent _ or 1 cent per kilowatt hour _ in January in an attempt to help, but that turned out to be far from enough. ??In March, the Commission approved an additional 3-cent increase. But Davis followed quickly with an alternative proposal. The next day, PG&E filed for bankruptcy, raising the specter that a federal judge could order even higher rates. ??Although the PUC has sole authority to raise rates under state law, Davis' proposal has complicated an already complex process. The governor appointed three of the five members of the commission, and his appointees seem inclined to show him deference. But Davis has been slow in filing the details of his plan, which has made it hard for the PUC to proceed. ??KRT CALIFORNIA is a premium service of Knight Ridder/Tribune ??(c) 2001, San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.). ??Visit Mercury Center, the World Wide Web site of the Mercury News, at http://www.sjmercury.com/ JOURNAL-CODE: SJ LOAD-DATE: April 20, 2001 of 78 DOCUMENTS ?????????????????Copyright 2001 The Chronicle Publishing Co. ?????????????????????????The San Francisco Chronicle ????????????????????APRIL 20, 2001, FRIDAY, FINAL EDITION SECTION: NEWS; Pg.

Financial analysts said a worsening of the state's energy mess would increase the possibility of higher electricity rates. ???Nevertheless, lawmakers are unlikely to accept the Edison deal -- at least not in its present form. ???""We are going to go through this thing extensively,"" said state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco. ""There are a lot of concerns about the valuation."" ???Still, he said, legislative backing for the accord remains possible as long as Edison is open to amending some of the terms. ???""The Edison people are smart enough to know that the Legislature is going to have its say,"" Burton said. ???Indeed, sources familiar with the matter said Edison expected a certain amount of tinkering with the deal and would not resist efforts to reach common ground with lawmakers. ???""The Assembly members do not view bankruptcy as a favorable alternative,"" said Assemblyman Herb Wesson, D-Los Angeles.

""This could lead to a surcharge on electricity bills to guarantee the bonds."" ???Bryson, not surprisingly, defended Edison's agreement with the governor as a prudent alternative to bankruptcy. ???""This is a very good deal for the state,"" he said. ""It is not a bailout. Edison gives up a lot to make all this possible."" ???Southern California Edison will sell its power lines to the state for $2.8 billion. It also will provide low-cost power to California for 10 years and drop a federal lawsuit seeking full recovery of nearly $5 billion in past debt. ???Critics say the state is paying far too much for Edison's transmission system -- more than two times book value -- and that the power lines are of little use unless PG&E's grid also can be acquired. ???""It's a multibillion-dollar ratepayer bailout of Edison,"" said Doug Heller, a spokesman for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. ""Edison gets off scot-free."" ???Under the most likely scenario, lawmakers will seek to reduce the amount paid for Edison's power lines and to increase the role of the California Public Utilities Commission in regulating the utility. ???They also will try to come up with a workable contingency plan for the state if PG&E remains adamant in its refusal to sell off its part of the power grid. ???""The deal on the table is still salvageable,"" said Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego.

PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. ??Edison is continuing to work with state officials and its creditors. ??The utility said its board of directors decided to withhold bonuses to all but two key executives because the financial effects of the energy crisis have overshadowed all other aspects of company and individual performance. ??The two executives who did get bonuses earned them for their roles in preserving the viability of the companies during the crisis and for retention purposes, Edison said. ??Ted Craver, senior vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer at Edison International, was paid $375,000 in 2000 and received a $100,000 bonus. His total compensation in 1999 was $652,100. ??Harold Ray, executive vice president at Southern California Edison, received a salary of $390,000 in 2000 and a bonus of $50,000. His cash compensation in 1999 was $818,400. ??PG&E paid Chairman Robert D. Glynn Jr. $945,086 in salary and benefits during 2000, a 58 percent decrease from $2.26 million in the prior year, according to the company's proxy statement. ??Glynn, 57, received a 12.5 percent increase in his base salary but didn't get a bonus. ??Gordon R. Smith, who runs Pacific Gas and Electric, received a 14.5 percent raise in his base salary to $630,000 but didn't receive a bonus. In 1999, Smith's compensation package totaled $1.1 million.

The previous administration felt compelled to dominate the evening news every day and the president said, 'I'm focused on getting the job done,""' Rove said Wednesday in an Associated Press interview. ??Running a low-key presidency sets Bush apart from former President Clinton, but the style has its critics. ??Some lawmakers, including members of his own party, said Bush could have saved more of his $1.6 trillion tax-cut plan if he had personally lobbied more lawmakers. ??Bush issued a statement expressing sympathy with police and protesters in Cincinnati, but ran the risk of looking detached. ??And Rove acknowledged that there was some discussion in the White House about Bush attending the U.S. crew's homecoming to reap the public relations reward for freeing the crew. ??But the president vetoed the idea, according to Rove, who quoted Bush as saying, ""I want it to be about them and I don't want to go through the discombobulation that it would require of them and their families for me to show up."" ??It is not hard to imagine Clinton commanding center stage during city riots, a budget battle or an international crisis, but Rove said, ""We intended to have a smaller profile than the previous administration."" ??Bush's ""attitude is that he's not going to be measured by whether or not he gets on the evening news but on whether or not he gets progress,"" Rove said during the 45-minute interview. ??He sat at a polished wood conference table in his West Wing office, his hands folded over a memo he had discretely turned upside down. Newspapers and a Starbucks coffee mug littered his desktop. Framed photos and artwork were propped against a chair, still awaiting hanging on his 89th day in the White House. ??A painting of a Texas landscape decorated one wall, allowing Bush's political strategist of eight years to ""go on vacation whenever I'm on the phone."" ??Rove is on the telephone a lot these days crafting strategies to pass the White House legislative agenda, maintain GOP control of Congress in 2002 and position the president for a re-election bid in 2004. ??Bush narrowly won the White House without California's 54 electoral votes, and Rove said the president could win re-election without the state ""but it's always nicer to carry the Golden State."" ??He said the state's electricity shortage will not hurt Bush's chances in 2004, adding that the administration has done ""virtually everything"" Gov. Gray Davis has requested. ??He suggested that the state caused its own problems by not building enough power plants and failing to follow the lead of other states, such as Bush's Texas, to establish sound energy policies before a crisis struck. ??""This has got a very human dimension to it,"" Rove said. ""It's one thing to talk about power supplies. It's another thing when you talk about how it affects their jobs, how it's affecting their livelihoods, how it's affecting the safety of their communities and the health of their families. This is a tough issue and it ought to be a wake up call for the entire country."" ??A White House task force headed by Vice President Dick Cheney is working on recommendations to address both short-term problems of soaring electricity and natural gas prices and longer-term energy supply problems, focusing on producing more domestic oil and gas and building more electric power plants. ??Rove said the administration will soon unveil new conservation measures aimed at helping California ease its shortages. ??He said Bush and his political team are bringing House Republicans from politically competitive states to the White House, where they discuss their districts' needs and, often, gain local media attention. ??Bush also plans to attend fund-raisers for House and Senate campaign committees, helping the party gear up for 2002 midterm elections in which control of Congress is at stake. ??Rove also said: ??-Bush will not seek broad authority to negotiate trade treaties anytime soon, allowing time to make the legislation more attractive to Democrats. ""You can only put so much into that pipe, and we've stuffed it,"" he said of Bush's crowded legislative agenda. The ""fast track"" authority is key to Bush's plans for a free trade zone stretching from Canada to Chile. That proposal is the focus of the three-day Summit of the Americas beginning Friday in Quebec City. ??-Americans will support Bush's environmental policies despite criticism of his decision to overturn some initiatives of the final days of the Clinton administration. Rove stopped short of accusing Clinton of setting Bush up for political troubles. ""I'm not certain I see a conspiracy there. I do think it's interesting"" that Clinton waited until the last moment to act. ??-Bush has not wavered since the campaign in his view that states should be able to opt out of minimum wage increases passed by Congress. ""We are not all one single labor market,"" Rove said.

The regulatory staff recommends a $108.7 million increase. For residential customers, a requested 34-percent hike would be reduced to 16 percent. ??""This is not a final decision,"" said Jeff Beaman, a spokesman for IDACORP and Idaho Power. ""In many cases, the commissioners disagree with the staff."" ??The report noted there was nothing illegal about the transactions between Idaho Power and its sister company, Idaho Energy Systems. To change that, the staff urged commissioners to create a mechanism that forces Idaho Power to buy electricity at the same price Idaho Energy Systems pays for it. ??The report said Idaho Energy Systems, an unregulated subsidiary of IDACORP, repeatedly purchased electricity on the wholesale market and then sold it to Idaho Power for a profit. ??Idaho Power officials contend the recommended policy change could financially cripple the company. It already spent $161 million buying power on the open market and cannot recover the money unless the coming year's rate is increased. ??""The failure to recoup these funds could lead to liquidity problems,"" Beaman said, ""and that will hurt not only the company but our customers as well."" ??But IDACORP paid all of its salaried staff - including Idaho Power employees - a 15-percent bonus at the end of the last fiscal year because the company had achieved record profits of $139.9 million, 53 percent over the year before. ??Beaman said incentive payments have no impact on the rate request. ??Charging the higher rate between the two subsidiaries was the result of a commission order tying the price that Idaho Energy charges for wholesale electricity to the Mid-Columbia Index. The index has been pegged at unrealistic levels since the energy crisis erupted in California, and fluctuates constantly. ??""We are confident that the transactions were performed within the letter and spirit of the law, and have not been at the expense of ratepayers,"" Beaman said. ??Commission spokesman Gene Fadness said commissioners cannot comment on a case before them, but their ultimate decision can be appealed to the Idaho Supreme Court. ??The Public Utilities Commission staff also recommended: ??- Deferring $66.1 million of Idaho Power's rate request, without interest, until answers are available about the company's electricity deals. ??- Deferring another $45.8 million of the request until next year, when the commissioners would allow Idaho Power to collect 5-percent interest. That part of the hike was earmarked for wholesale power purchases this year - purchases that the staff believes will be much more expensive next year. ??- Cutting another $10.3 million from the increase request, contending it was an error by Idaho Power's Risk Management Committee that the company planned on passing on to ratepayers. ??- Implementing a low-interest loan program to encourage energy conservation by Idaho Power customers. ??- A two-year phase-in of any rate increase ultimately approved that is substantially over 20 percent. ??- Changing residential rates to a three-tiered system to encourage savings. ??Homeowners would pay 5.52 cents per kilowatt-hour for the first 800 kwh used, 6.12 cents per kwh for use between 800 kwh and 2,000 kwh, and 7.48 cents per kwh for use over 2,000 kwh. The current residential rate of 5.2 cents per kwh. ??The staff report also took Idaho Power to task, saying it was warned of the possibility of spiraling prices and power shortages as far back as 1995. ??But the company contends it did not want to build generating plants during the past decade because with electricity deregulation looming, nobody knew what independent power facilities were being considered.

""It's obviously way higher than $100 million."" ??Natural gas rates at the California border generally tracked national prices until November, when they spiked as high as 11 times higher than the price of natural gas elsewhere in the nation, Carpenter said. ??""I have never seen gas prices like this anywhere in the world,"" said Carpenter, who has been studying the energy market for 20 years for Cambridge, Mass.-based consultant The Brattle Group. The Brattle Group was hired by Edison to study the natural gas market. ??The committee is one of two legislative committees exploring whether illegal market manipulation in the electricity and natural gas markets has driven up California's energy costs. ??""This is a market that is plagued by the exercise of market power,"" Frank Wolak, chairman of the California Independent System Operator's Market Surveillance Committee, told the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market. The ISO runs the state's power grid. ??However, ""there is no law against me saying, 'I'm not going to sell to you,""' Wolak said. Market manipulation only becomes illegal when there is collusion, Wolak said, and such evidence is hard to find. ??Electricity generators and natural gas suppliers say a severe supply and demand imbalance - not market manipulation - has led to higher prices. ??""Everybody's busy doing investigations. They're not interested in solving the problem,"" said Independent Energy Producers Executive Director Jan Smutny-Jones. ??Investigations ""are wasting everybody's time,"" Smutny-Jones said, adding that previous probes and lawsuits have uncovered no wrongdoing. He said the state's power problems came because state regulators denied utilities the chance to sign long-term energy contracts when they had the chance. ??""People have been playing by the rules,"" Smutny-Jones said. ??But the Senate committee's first witnesses are ISO officials who authored studies that claim the state paid more than $6 billion too much for power last year. ??Committee chair Joseph Dunn, D-Garden Grove, also has slated state Auditor Elaine Howell, who last month blamed buyers and sellers for skyrocketing electricity costs. Dunn also has scheduled future testimony from state, federal, academic and private investigators studying the power market. ??He invited five major generators to attend the committee's second hearing next week. All five - Reliant, Dynegy, Williams Energy, Duke Energy and Mirant - say they are eager to cooperate and clear their names, Dunn said. ??Dunn asked the five for a total of 86 specific documents. If the companies feel they cannot provide documents because of legal or confidentiality concerns, Dunn said he will subpoena them. ??Smutny-Jones said investigators appear to be growing desperate to blame the state's natural gas and electricity price hikes on illegal market manipulation instead of natural market forces. ??He cited Attorney General Bill Lockyer's announcement last week that any informant who helped prove wrongdoing would be entitled to a percentage of the state's recovery he estimated could range from $50 million to hundreds of millions of dollars. ??""If the state's offering a $50 million reward, they haven't found anything,"" Smutny-Jones said. ""I don't think you're going to find the fact that anybody did anything criminal here."" ??Assemblywoman Jenny Oropeza, D-Long Beach, said she believes otherwise after Wednesday's testimony: ""I think it is very clear there was some price manipulation going on."" ??But Assemblyman John Campbell, R-Irvine, isn't sure there was anything illegal. ??""There clearly are market forces at work, that's evident,"" Campbell said. ""Whether you make the jump to market manipulation ... I haven't seen conclusive evidence that leads me to make that jump."" LOAD-DATE: April 20, 2001",Company Business/Strategy

O.J. did--or didn't--have a bloody glove. ??Here in the Capitol, the hot dog has become an unlikely metaphor for the state's energy crisis. ??In packed news conferences and heated Assembly floor debates, lawmakers from both parties have evoked images of the ordinary dog to help explain an extraordinary mess. ??The genesis of this statehouse trend is difficult to determine. Assemblyman Fred Keeley appears to be the first to have tossed the hot dog into the political fire. ??During a crucial Assembly discussion in January, the Boulder Creek Democrat recited the lyrics to a familiar Oscar Mayer jingle as a way of admitting that a controversial bill to have the state buy electricity to avoid blackouts was unpalatable, but necessary. ??""It's the dog kids love to bite,"" said Keeley of the jingle. ""Well, this is the bill people love to hate."" ??A bizarre, partisan hot dog duel ensued. Assemblyman John Campbell (R-Irvine) responded by likening the unpredictable financial consequences of the Keeley legislation to biting recklessly into mystery meat. ??""Before I bite into it I see what's on the outside, but I can't see the inside,"" Campbell said. ""If nobody can tell me what's on the inside, it may be bitter, it may be bad, it may make me sick."" ??Assemblywoman Carole Migden (D-San Francisco) angrily fired back, wanting to know why Campbell, a professed hot dog eater, was suddenly so critical of its unknown contents. ??""It's OK to eat a hot dog that's full of animal bones and hair,"" Migden said. ""That's a hot dog that's OK with you, but this kind of hot dog isn't."" ??Yet it was Senate leader John Burton who made it the key ingredient in a Capitol catch phrase. ??Burton described a plan to purchase the electrical power grid from the state's private utilities as a fair swap, saying: ""I give you a dollar, you give me a hot dog."" ??The sound-bite quickly took on a life of its own. With the cost of the energy crisis growing faster than the price of ballpark franks, critics doubted the public's appetite for a multibillion-dollar hot dog. ??""Do you really want a hot dog? That is the question,"" said Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers, a trade group for power generators. ??Not content to let a dog lie in its bun, lawmakers such as Assemblyman Bill Leonard (R-San Bernardino) kept the hot dog in public discourse. ??When Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy protection, Leonard was one of a chorus of legislators who questioned the merits of purchasing the remaining portion of the power lines, calling it ""not even half a hot dog."" ??Added Assemblyman Bill Campbell (R-Villa Park): ""It's like paying Mercedes prices for a broken down hot dog cart."" ??In recent weeks, the hot dog rhetoric appeared to have gone cold. Then Assemblyman Juan Vargas (D-San Diego) revived it. ??After enduring hours of testimony on details of the deal to purchase Edison's power lines, Vargas said his opinion of the dollar-equals-hot-dog deal had diminished. ??""They're trying to charge us for a hot dog,"" Vargas said of the utility, ""but it looks like we're only going to be getting a wienie."" ??Reliant Vice President John Stout also recently weighed in with his own hot dog analogy as he tried to explain why his company's income had jumped so much during the crisis. ??""If you have a hot dog stand and you go out and buy five to six more hot dog stands,"" Stout said, referring to his company's purchase of power plants, ""then naturally you would expect the operating income to go up."" ??Alas, the dog days of summer have yet to begin.

Gray Davis pursued a new strategy yesterday to control wholesale electricity costs by demanding that federal regulators ban two generators from selling power in California at market rates, arguing that they have manipulated the market to their advantage. ???Meanwhile, the Davis administration lambasted a federal plan to implement temporary price controls, scheduled to go into effect Tuesday. State officials said the measures would do nothing to tame California's out-of-control costs for electricity. ???Davis, whose calls for broader price limits on wholesale electricity have been rejected repeatedly by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, is scheduled to meet with President Bush next week to ask Washington to do more to help California. ???""Federal regulators said that prices were 'unjust and unreasonable' nearly nine months ago, but they have been AWOL ever since,"" Davis said in a statement. ???The California Independent System Operator, managers of the state's electrical grid, asked energy regulators yesterday to revoke the authority they have given Williams Energy and AES Inc. to sell power at market-based rates. Instead, the Davis administration wants the companies to be forced to sell at cost-plus rates, which would ensure a reasonable but limited profit. ???""Market-based rate authority is not an entitlement,"" the ISO said in a filing with federal regulators. ???The ISO asked regulators to act by June 15, saying that any delay ""places California consumers and the state's economy at extreme peril."" ???Similar filings against other companies, such as Mirant, Duke and Reliant, are being considered, said Charles Robinson, general counsel for the ISO. ???Robinson said the ISO has a ""well developed"" record of price manipulation by the two companies. He said information previously given to federal regulators proved the prices charged to California were excessive. ???'GRANDSTANDING' ACCUSATION ???Aaron Thomas, a spokesman for Virginia-based AES, said the administration is grandstanding. ???""This is akin to the rhetoric the governor has used for the past several months,"" he said. ""We are well below the index FERC uses to establish concerns about market power. ???""As to this rhetoric about these companies abusing the marketplace -- check the facts. We lost money last year,"" Thomas said. ???A spokeswoman for Williams said the company would not comment because it had not seen the filing. ???Earlier this month, Oklahoma-based Williams agreed to pay $8 million to settle charges with FERC that the company was purposely withholding electricity from California's power market. The company admitted no wrongdoing, and officials said a full hearing would have cleared the company. ???If the regulatory commission denies the state's requests, or doesn't ""act in the time frame we believe is necessary to prevent harm,"" the state can appeal to a circuit court, Robinson said. ???BUSH VISIT POSTURING CHARGE ???Jan Smutny-Jones, head of the Independent Energy Producers Association, said the move is posturing by Davis ahead of Bush's visit. ???""This is an interesting welcome mat for President Bush,"" he said. ""Do we want a dialogue or a diatribe?"" ???In advance of Bush's visit, Vice President Dick Cheney said yesterday that nothing more can be done to help solve California's power problems this summer. ???He also rejected price controls, saying that previous efforts have contributed to a supply shortage. ???A spokesman for Davis rejected that notion and denied that the timing of yesterday's announcements were connected to the Bush-Davis meeting. ???Davis aides expressed hope that Bush's two new FERC commissioners, Pat Wood III, a close Bush ally expected to take over the chairmanship of the board, and Nora Mead Brownell, a state utility regulator in Pennsylvania, would hear California's pleas. The two new commissioners were confirmed yesterday by the U.S. Senate. ???Among the things Davis wants changed is the regulatory commission temporary price relief plan scheduled to take effect Tuesday. ???The regulators would limit wholesale prices during power alerts in California, when reserves drop below 7 percent of available capacity. ???Many state officials believe that doesn't go far enough. The state Assembly, in documents to be filed Tuesday, said price controls should cover all hours -- not just power emergencies. ???And there is a chance the controls will be in effect for just a few days. Under the regulatory commission plan, the state and the three investor-owned utilities must file a proposal to join a regional transmission organization by June 1. If they do not to do so, the price controls disappear. ???Davis administration officials expect to file another response dealing with the regional transmission organization by Friday, Robinson said. The Assembly filing rejects joining such an organization, which federal officials favor as a means to better manage and improve grid capacity in the West.

EMSHWILLER Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL On the eve of a meeting Tuesday between President George Bush and California Gov. Gray Davis, top advisers to the governor said the state could be pushed into recession unless the federal government imposes temporary price caps to contain soaring wholesale electricity costs. President Bush has consistently opposed price caps. The governor's team called a Memorial Day news conference to highlight what they saw as the dangers to the economy of the state, and possibly the nation, from the tens of billions of dollars being spent this year to purchase electricity. The governor's aides estimated that statewide, wholesale electricity purchases this year could hit $50 billion compared with about $7 billion in 1999. Some estimates for this year's power expenditures are even higher. If California were a separate nation, ""an energy shock of that magnitude would be expected to cause a significant recession,"" said Alan Blinder, a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, at the conference. While being part of a broader national economy could somewhat mitigate the impact, the higher power costs are ""a recipe for stagflation in California,"" added Mr. Blinder. ""Stagflation"" refers to stagnant economic conditions and inflation -- a condition that struck the nation when energy prices soared in the 1970s. Though the advisers painted perhaps the dreariest outlook yet to come from the governor's office, they said that the Davis plan for financing the state's electricity purchases remains intact. As reported, the state plans to sell about $12.5 billion in bonds later this year. The state has been purchasing electricity since January, when its failed utility-deregulation plan left California's two biggest utilities financially unable to continue buying power. If price caps were instituted, the state might have to borrow less money than anticipated or at least face a decreased danger of having to borrow more if the power situation gets worse, said Joseph Fichera, chief executive of New York-based Saber Partners LLC and an adviser to Mr. Davis. The governor plans to press his case for price caps over the next six to 18 months, as supplies are increased with new power plants due to come into operation, the advisers said. However, Mr. Bush and other federal officials have repeatedly said that they believe price caps would be counterproductive and discourage the building of new power plants. Write to John R.

Personal incomes rose 0.3 percent. ??Bush Won't Cap Electricity Prices ??LOS ANGELES (AP) ??President Bush says he won't force down soaring electricity prices that have cost California nearly $8 billion since January. The Republican president and embattled Democratic Gov. Gray Davis arranged a meeting today to talk about the state's energy crisis, but there was no indication they would break their stalemate. Bush opposes price limits on wholesale electricity that utilities buy, arguing they do nothing to address supply-and-demand issues at the heart of the crisis. ??Tornado Injures 18 in Colorado ??ELLICOTT, Colo.

Robert Hillman BODY: ??LOS ANGELES _ President Bush landed in hostile territory Monday night, beginning his first presidential visit to California amid a pressing energy crisis that he says he cannot ease in the short term. ??""We welcome him to California,"" said California Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat who has waged a long-distance war with the Republican president over the high cost and short supply of electricity in the nation's most populous state. ??""I hope he has an opportunity to talk firsthand to some of the people who are adversely impacted by the very high rates we're paying for electricity."" ??But the president's carefully scrubbed schedule for the next two days provides little time for such an opportunity, although he will confer privately with business leaders to discuss high-tech solutions to the state's energy problems. ??Arriving on a cross-country flight that touched down in Arizona for a Memorial Day tribute, Bush headed off to prepare for an early-morning stop Tuesday to promote energy conservation at the Marine Corps' Camp Pendleton and a luncheon address to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council. ??On Wednesday, he'll visit Sequoia National Park near Fresno, Calif., to launch a new drive to clean up and fix up national parks. ??He'll also meet privately Tuesday afternoon with Davis in what the Los Angeles Times characterized as a ""peace summit."" But no major shifts in policy are expected. White House aides suggest that the meeting will be a success if the governor even temporarily tempers his sometimes-harsh words for the administration. ??""The president's focus is going to be on solving problems. He's not interested in finger-pointing,"" White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said. ??""Whether people agree, or disagree, with the specifics of his energy plan, I think most Americans and most Californians are very pleased to see a president who is leading and taking action in addressing the issue head on."" ??However, recent public opinion polls show the president and the governor taking hits for the energy crisis in California. ??The Field Poll, finished a week ago, found that 54 percent of those surveyed believed Bush had handled the energy problems poorly, with Davis faring somewhat better at 38 percent. The margin of error for the 1,015 California interviews was 3.2 percentage points. ??An earlier survey by the Public Policy Institute of California found Davis' job approval rating plummeting, from 63 percent in January to 46 percent in May, as the state's energy troubles escalated. Bush's overall approval rating was higher at 57 percent, but still just as many of those surveyed gave him low marks for his handling of energy issues. That margin of error, for 2001 interviews, was 2 percentage points. ??In short, political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe said, Bush's visit to the state _ in his 19th week as president, after already visiting more than half the other states _ is long overdue. ??""His not responding, or not being perceived to respond, to the short-term needs of California has allowed Davis' arguments to resonate _ that the federal government is uncaring, is insensitive,"" Jeffe said. ??In his national energy policy unveiled nearly two weeks ago, Bush offered a series of mostly long-term recommendations to conserve energy, find more of it and substantially upgrade and expand the nation's oil refineries and transmission systems for natural gas and electricity. ??Davis, complaining that Texas energy companies in particular are gouging Californians, has urged Bush to embrace price controls for wholesale electricity, but the president has steadfastly refused. Vice President Dick Cheney, who oversaw development of the White House energy policy, emphasized as recently as Friday that there's no quick fix on the way for California. ??""Long term, the answer is to build more power plants, and that's exactly what they're doing,"" Cheney told the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ""But they're not going to have enough new capacity online this summer to avoid blackouts."" ??So the energy woes continue to fester in California. It's not just electricity and rolling blackouts. Gasoline prices of $2-and-more-a-gallon have become commonplace as well. ??""The gas bothers me more than the electric,"" said Tait Kmentt, who runs a legal process serving business in Irvine, Calif. ""Gas prices are killing me."" ??At $2.25-a-gallon for premium gasoline, he says, it costs him more than $40 to fill up his new Mercedes _ with no relief in sight. ??A newcomer to the state, Kmentt voted for Bush last fall and said he's glad the president is finally visiting California. But Kmentt cautioned, ""This will be a big test to see how concerned he is."" ??Kmentt said he understands the state's energy troubles are a ""huge problem that can't be fixed overnight,"" and right now he's blaming the power companies for the high price of electricity. ??""I just think the public is being lied to,"" he said. ??Still, this is not good news for Bush, who has been increasingly portrayed by Democrats as a Texas oilman still beholden to the industry. California, which he lost last fall to Al Gore by 12 percentage points, has become increasingly a political headache. ??Where his predecessor, Bill Clinton, seemed politically and personally comfortable, Bush is not, suggests Jeffe, a senior scholar in the School of Policy, Planning and Development at the University of Southern California. ??""An ego cannot be buoyed by losing the state by 12 points,"" she said. ""We are the state that was responsible for giving Al Gore his popular vote victory."" ??With the Senate now headed for Democratic control, Jeffe said, Bush's visit to California _ and others that will surely follow _ are essential to help Republicans hold their base in the House. ??If the energy crisis persists in California, further punishing its economy, the ripple effects will certainly spread, she said. ??""George Bush remembers the influence of the economy on the career of an incumbent president,"" Jeffe said, pointing to Bush's father, who was defeated by Clinton during an economic slump in 1992. ??""It took a while,"" she said, ""but people are beginning to get angry."" ??(c) 2001, The Dallas Morning News. ??Visit The Dallas Morning News on the World Wide Web at http://www.dallasnews.com/ JOURNAL-CODE: DA LOAD-DATE: May 29, 2001 of 98 DOCUMENTS 2001 / Los Angeles Times Angeles Times ??????????????????????May 29, 2001 Tuesday ?Home Edition SECTION: California; Part 2; Page 1; Metro Desk LENGTH: 1178 words HEADLINE: Governor to Stress Price Caps to Bush; Power: In a meeting today with the president, Davis will present a letter from economists backing cost controls and demand federal assistance. BYLINE: DAN MORAIN, JAMES GERSTENZANG, TIMES STAFF WRITERS BODY: ??Gov. Gray Davis will present a letter to President Bush today from top economists advocating wholesale electricity price controls, warning Monday that a failure by Bush to help California solve its energy crisis could signal to other regions that he may ignore their pleas. ??Bush, making his first trip to California, has set aside 20 minutes this afternoon to meet with Davis in Century City. In an interview with The Times, the Democratic governor vowed to repeat his request that the federal government move to cap wholesale power prices. Failure to act swiftly threatens the state and national economy, Davis said. ??""I want him to understand,"" Davis said, ""that if California has to pay 700 times more for electricity in 2001 than it did just two years ago, it could well drag our economy into a recession and could conceivably trigger a national recession. That is not good for anyone."" ??In the letter, 10 economists, including Cornell professor emeritus Alfred Kahn, a major proponent of airline deregulation, told of their ""deep concern"" about the failure of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to stabilize wholesale electricity prices in California. The economists faxed the letter to the White House on Friday afternoon, and provided the governor with a copy to present to Bush today. ??""FERC's failure to act now will have dire consequences for the state of California and will set back, potentially fatally, the diffusion of competitive electricity markets across the country,"" the economists, led by Frank Wolak of Stanford University, wrote. ""Moreover, this negative experience with electricity restructuring could delay or reverse current efforts to introduce competition into other formerly regulated industries."" ??Davis called the letter ""very significant validation of what we've been saying: The marketplace is not working and FERC has an obligation to act."" ??""We're not pleading for relief; we're entitled to it,"" Davis said. ??Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney repeatedly have said such controls never work. In California, caps might worsen the situation by limiting supply, they have argued, resulting in more blackouts this summer when demand for electricity is highest. ??The Bush-Davis meeting has had all the buildup of the political equivalent of a title fight: On one side, the Democratic governor of the nation's most populous state, which Bush lost by more than 1 million votes in November. On the other, the new president, coming off a roller coaster week of political defeat (the shift in control of the Senate) and victory (passage of his tax-cut plan), whose work in the Texas oil industry gives him a special history in the topic at hand. ??From afar, Davis has battled the Bush administration's energy policy. But, said Dan Bartlett, one of the president's chief communications advisors, ""The president has some interesting views on this topic as well, with some experience himself."" ??Bush's Energy secretary, Spencer Abraham, took steps Monday to increase electricity transmission capacity in California. He ordered the Western Area Power Administration, a division of the Energy Department that is responsible for marketing electricity from federal water projects in 15 Western states, to finish its planning for extra transmission capacity. ??At issue is so-called Path 15, an 84-mile stretch of power lines with insufficient capacity to carry the necessary load between Southern California and the northern part of the state, especially during peak hours. The central question is whether financing is available for a new transmission line. ??Davis lauded the action but said the president needs to do more. ??""If I have any advice to him of a political nature, it is take a chapter out of President Clinton's book. ??"" [Clinton] was very attentive to California, and as a result did better in 1996 than he did in '92. People felt he was here for us when we needed help. We need help."" ??Davis said that on a recent trip to Chicago, officials there worried that if Bush ""won't offer California some relief, he may not offer us relief,"" in a catastrophe. ??Among the facts and figures Davis intends to show the president is a chart showing that California paid $1.2 billion for electricity in the first quarter of 1999, $1.8 billion for the same period last year, and as much as $10.3 billion for electricity in the first three months of this year--at a time when conservation efforts had been taking hold and demand was down. ??""I hope the president will be as stunned as I am,"" said Davis, who is watching as the state spends more than $55 million a day to buy electricity that private utilities can no longer afford. ??Davis said that though he is trying to speed construction of power plants, encourage conservation, and return the private utilities to financial stability, the federal government has control over wholesale power prices. ??""Therein lies the final piece of this puzzle,"" Davis said. ""If it falls into place, we're on the way to putting this issue behind us. If it doesn't fall into place, it could create real economic havoc here and across the country."" ??Davis said that if Bush refuses to impose price controls, he should ""find some way to help us, consistent with his own belief."" ??""Turning a deaf ear not only won't be well received here,"" Davis said. ""It likely won't be received well elsewhere."" ??The state's energy crisis has posed a ticklish dilemma for Bush's busy travel schedulers: Had he visited earlier, it would have been awkward not to focus on energy issues. But until 11 days ago when a task force led by Cheney produced energy proposals, there would have been little Bush could say. ??Karen Hughes, the president's counselor, made it clear that regardless of the pressure, Bush will not yield on price caps. ??""We want to help. The president is very concerned about the energy situation and blackouts,"" she said. But limiting the wholesale price of energy would only discourage its production,"" Hughes said. ??California is the 30th state Bush has visited since taking office Jan. 20. His staff said the delay had to do not with energy issues but with politics and geography. ??With the administration focused in its first months on winning approval of the tax cut, the president's travels were largely dictated by that effort, his aides said. ??Besides, the president confided recently, even with Air Force One at the ready, it just takes too long to fly from Washington to California. ??Still, Hughes said, the president is not ignoring California. Condoleezza Rice, the president's national security advisor and a former Californian, sits next to Hughes every morning at the daily meeting of the White House senior staff, she said. ??What's more, the president ""has many friends in California,"" Hughes said, adding: ""Ernie has a home in California these days."" Ernie is the Bush family cat that is living with a friend in Brentwood while the First Family lives in the White House. ??* ??Times Staff Writer Massie Ritsch contributed to this story.

BYLINE: MITCHELL LANDSBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER DATELINE: McKITTRICK, Calif. BODY: ??You could think of this as California's own little slice of west Texas. ??Here in the scruffy brown hills of western Kern County, oil rigs grow more easily than trees, pickups are more common than cars, and chicken fried steak is the most popular dish at Mike and Annie's McKittrick Hotel. ??The hotel--which no longer offers lodging, just food and drink, and plenty of it--is bustling these days with the roustabout energy of a Lone Star construction camp. Just down the road, a mammoth electrical power plant is rising out of the sagebrush, its generators housed in four boxy buildings the size of airplane hangars. ??It is one of six new major gas-fired power plants expected to be built in Kern County over the next several years, an electrical construction boom unmatched anywhere in California. Kern, which already has a large surplus of electricity, is cementing its place as California's energy capital, assuming far more than its share of the burden in recharging the state's drained power supplies. ??Over the next several years, the county will add nearly 5,000 megawatts of power to the statewide grid. That is more than California now imports, on average, from out-of-state suppliers. It's enough to supply about five counties the size of Kern, which fills the dusty southern rim of the San Joaquin Valley and has a population of 662,000. ??In some parts of the state, a proposal to build a new power plant is a call to throw up the barricades. In recent months, intense community opposition has forced developers to pull back proposals to build major plants in South Gate and San Jose, although Gov. Gray Davis has tried to revive plans for the San Jose plant. ??You don't hear a lot of not-in-my-backyard talk in Kern County. ??""There should be power plants in everybody's backyard,"" said Paul Gipe, chairman of the Kern chapter of the Sierra Club, which did not oppose any of the new plants. ""If people are concerned about having too many power plants, they should think twice when they flip on the light switch."" ??New, natural gas-fired power plants, Gipe reasoned, are relatively clean and will not add significantly to the county's serious air pollution problems. Ideally, he said, they will allow the state to close some older, dirtier plants that cause considerably more environmental damage. ??If environmentalists don't oppose the plants, it's not too much of a leap to guess that some people might be positively thrilled about them. ??Just try, for instance, asking somebody in Taft, an oil center south of McKittrick. ""It's more money coming into Kern County--that's the way I look at it,"" said Pamela Dunlap, who runs a downtown thrift shop. ??An Economy Rooted in the Oil Industry ??She stood in the twilight outside her shop, on a street that embodies many of the most attractive attributes of small town Americana--with one small difference. Where some towns might have statues of their founders or war heroes in prominent public places, Taft has erected small oil rigs and other pieces of drilling machinery, a reminder of its economic roots. ??That Kern County has stepped up as California's blackout-buster is, perhaps, not surprising. ??To begin with, there's geography. Kern stands astride California's major north-south electrical transmission lines at precisely the spot at which they divide between the service areas of Pacific Gas & Electric, which serves Northern California, and Southern California Edison. That spot can be pinpointed as the Midway substation, a vast jungle of humming wires, transformers and circuit breakers that lies a short distance west of Interstate 5 in the town of Buttonwillow. ??Already, massive new circuit-breakers--they look like Frankenstein helmets sprouting 5-foot-long sparkplugs--are being erected at Midway to handle the power from two major plants that will be revving up in the coming months: PG&E National Energy's La Paloma plant, the one near McKittrick; and Edison Mission Energy's Sunrise plant, just south of Taft. ??The county is served by two major natural gas pipelines, which will be tapped to run the plants. In fact, Kern contains the state's largest known reservoirs of natural gas. ??Another of Kern's geographic advantages? ??""You look around, and you'll see there aren't a lot of people living around here,"" observed Stephen Whaley, who is overseeing construction of the Sunrise plant. In the surrounding hills, an orchard of oil rigs bobbed in the morning haze. Dirt roads cut crudely across the landscape, bisecting a crisscross of steam pipes, fuel lines and electrical wires. ??""This area is all about oil,"" Whaley said. Casting a glance at the modular 560-megawatt plant rising behind him, he added with a wry smile, ""You know, I guess you could look at this from the road, and you could make the argument that it improves the looks."" ??The Sunrise plant, a relatively simple single-cycle plant, is expected to fire up 320 megawatts of its total output by Aug. 1, a scant nine months after construction began. The other plants--more complex and efficient dual-cycle operations--will be opening over the next several years, assuming all receive final approval. ??The lack of major opposition to the plants is, of course, another reason developers see Kern County as a good place to build. The county has long had a more intimate relationship with energy--oil, gas, electricity--than most places. To people here, the link between a natural gas well and a lightbulb, or an oil derrick and a gas pedal, is neither theoretical nor especially threatening. They're comfortable with energy. ??Kern produces more crude oil than any other county in the United States outside Alaska. Property taxes from oil companies have helped build handsome new schools in Bakersfield, the county seat and largest city. The companies' big payrolls have helped populate elegant subdivisions with names that sound vaguely Houstonian: Seven Oaks, River Oaks, Landmark Estates. ??Which brings us to the Texas connection. ??It's hard to overlook it, in a county that runs on oil and cotton and boasts a country music scene to rival Austin's. Conversations in the finer Bakersfield restaurants are filled with references to trips to Texas, of colleagues in Midland and Odessa. A Bakersfield radio station was running a contest recently: The winners would be flown to a bull riding championship in Houston. ??Until December 1999, American Airlines offered direct jet service between Bakersfield and Dallas. It stopped after Occidental Petroleum moved its headquarters from Bakersfield to Houston. ??This is a county where President Bush received more support in the November election than he did in Texas, his home state. But then, Bush already had a Bakersfield connection: He lived there briefly as a child when his father, former President George Bush, worked in the Kern oil fields. ??""You look at the topography around Bakersfield, and the county's morals and ethics--that predominantly conservative attitude that we have around here--and you look at the oil, and you could be in Midland,"" said John Allen, the general manager of Occidental of Elk Hills, which is developing a power plant in tandem with Sempra Energy of San Diego. ??A lot of people in Kern County will tell you they don't mind being an energy farm for the state. It's a living, after all. ??""It's good to be working at home,"" said Joe Ryan, a Bakersfield pipe welder who has spent years on the road seeking the heavy construction work that seemed to have vanished in his hometown. Now he's working at the La Paloma plant, a 1,048-megawatt behemoth that will come online in phases beginning in December. ??About 800 people are at work on the plant, and several hundred more will be employed in the coming months. And after that plant is done, there will be others to build. ??""This is a good job here, I tell you what,"" said Ryan, 47, who has been banking his overtime on six 10-hour days a week--sometimes more. ??County Sees Itself as 'Part of the Solution' ??But there are some signs of simmering resentment, especially among county leadership. After all, if every other county produced just half the electricity that Kern generates, California wouldn't have an energy crisis. And people in Kern County are getting hit with the same spring-loaded electricity bills, the same rolling blackouts as everybody else. ??""I think the people of California are either going to be part of the solution or part of the problem,"" said Assemblyman Roy Ashburn (R-Bakersfield). ""And in Kern County, we have a long history of being part of the solution, especially when it comes to energy issues."" ??Elsewhere in the state, Ashburn sees ""a lot of arrogance--people who enjoy the benefits of a very high quality of life, enjoy the benefits of electric power for jobs and for their personal life, but with an exclusivity that it's someone else's problem to create that for them. We don't have that attitude in Kern County."" ??Power Buildup in Kern County ??Six new major gas-fired power plants are expected to be built in Kern County over the next several years, making the county the power capital of the state. ??* ??RELATED STORY ??Letter to Bush: Gov.

SANGER DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 28 BODY: ??Days after he suffered the biggest political setback of his four-month-old presidency and then won the tax cut that he staked his campaign upon, President Bush traveled tonight to California, carefully calibrating how to deal with the state's energy crisis. ??After Memorial Day celebrations in Washington and Mesa, Ariz., Mr. Bush began his first visit as president to the most populous state, which he lost by roughly 12 percentage points in November's election. The visit seems likely to showcase the clash between two very different energy strategies and political strategies. ???Mr. Bush will meet briefly on Tuesday with Gov. Gray Davis, who will insist, as he did again today, that the federal government impose price caps on wholesale electric power. ??The White House says Mr. Bush will refuse, again. He will argue that such caps would only discourage increased production of electric power. ""We think that's a mistake,"" Vice President Dick Cheney said on Friday, talking about why he rejected those options when he prepared the energy policy the administration made public 10 days ago. ??But Mr. Bush knows that how he handles the California energy crisis could prove critical to his political fortunes, especially now that his party's loss of control in the Senate seems bound to slow or derail passage of major elements of his energy plan. ??Moreover, the president can no longer argue that the best cure for high energy prices is a tax cut, because that is now legislative history. As one of his aides said this weekend, after Congress approved the $1.35 trillion tax cut that will be phased in over the next 10 years, ""we will have to turn now to the other arguments."" ??Most of those arguments involve urging the rest of the country not to follow California in a partial deregulation of the market, with disastrous results. ??Repeatedly Mr. Bush has chastised California's politicians, and by implication Mr. Davis himself, for ignoring politically unpalatable choices to avert the state's power-generating crisis. Ten days ago, standing in front of a hydroelectric plant in Pennsylvania, Mr. Bush used the state as Exhibit A for his argument about what happens when population rises, when over-regulation freezes the construction of new power plants and the stringing of new transmission lines, and when politicians fail to plan for the long term. ??""The problems in California shows that you cannot conserve your way to energy independence,"" Mr. Bush said then. ??At the same time, his aides were pointing to polls showing Mr. Davis's approval ratings plunging. They did not mention that Mr. Bush's ratings in the state were hardly any better. A series of recent polls show that roughly two-thirds of Californians believe Mr. Bush should be doing far more to help the state, though it is unclear exactly what kind of help they have in mind. ??So Mr. Bush's aides have been struggling for days to choreograph the two-day visit here, trying to find ways to differ with Mr. Davis without seeming callous about the problem or in conflict with the state. ??The betting is that Mr. Bush will focus on long-term solutions, in contrast to Mr. Davis's call for the quicker fix of price caps. ??The effort started today. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham issued an order of chiefly symbolic importance, saying his department would move quickly to determine whether investors were interested in financing and co-owning a new transmission line that could bring more power to the state. ??""The level of interest will be a factor in the decision to build the line later this year,"" the Energy Department said. It said that it would proceed with studies of how the land could be acquired, by eminent domain if necessary, and that it would speed ahead with environmental reviews. ??But Mr. Abraham left wide open the question of whether Washington would go ahead with the project even if no private financing was available. ??""The Bush administration is taking a leadership role in addressing a long-neglected problem in California's electricity transmission system,"" Mr. Abraham said. ""California's electricity problems developed over a period of years and cannot be solved overnight. However, we can move now on actions that will help avert the same types of problems from recurring year after year."" ??The statement was clearly intended as a prelude to the meeting with Mr. Davis, which will be closed to the press. So will a meeting with energy entrepreneurs. (Mr. Bush passed on Mr. Davis's suggestion of a forum with small-business owners and residents who have seen the lights go out.) ??Few expect Mr. Bush or Mr. Davis to change his mind about energy caps after their meeting. ??But for Mr. Bush it will not all be tough love. On Tuesday morning Mr. Bush is scheduled to travel to Camp Pendleton to repeat his call for the military and other federal users of power in California to flip off their switches whenever possible. But given his own comments, and Mr. Cheney's, about the limited utility of conservation, that order could strike some Californians as a little hollow. ??Later he will give a trade speech in Los Angeles, underscoring the message that if California hopes to remain the world's greatest exporter of high technology -- if it were a nation, California would be the world's sixth-largest economy -- it must find new ways to produce and deliver electricity. ??Already, leading Silicon Valley companies are threatening to build their next-generation chip fabrication plants elsewhere, probably in Texas, which has a surplus of generating capacity, a move that would further undermine Mr. Davis's stewardship. ??In fact, Mr. Bush's Texas roots will never be far from the political battlefield here. Mr. Davis has accused Texas energy companies of profiteering at California's expense. To press the case, he has hired two political operatives from the Clinton White House, Marc D. Fabiani and Chris Lehane, who are being paid tens of thousands of dollars a month to make the case for price caps. ??California's attorney general, Bill Lockyer, also a Democrat, suggested to The Wall Street Journal last week that some time in jail would be the best way to deal with one of Mr. Bush's biggest supporters -- Kenneth Lay, who heads the Enron Corporation and has sought to influence the selection of members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. ??The comments may have been partly facetious, but they were not interpreted that way here. ??http://www.nytimes.com LOAD-DATE: May 29, 2001 of 98 DOCUMENTS ??????????????Copyright 2001 Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service ???????????????????????Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service ??????????????????????????The Orange County Register 29, 2001, Tuesday SECTION: DOMESTIC NEWS KR-ACC-NO: ?K7500 LENGTH: 825 words HEADLINE: California's power crisis generating lots of heat BYLINE: By John Howard BODY: ??SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Detectives would seem to be tripping over each other to discover who did what to whom, and why, in California's energy crisis. ??While electricity may be scarce, investigations are plentiful. A dozen major probes are afoot, many overlap, and more loom. The atmosphere is heated, the rhetoric strong. State, federal and local investigators, along with court officers, financial experts and special investigators, are poring over thousands of pages of documents from government agencies and private companies. ??At the top of the swarming heap is the $10 million investigation mounted by the state Attorney General's Office to answer the core question: Did a handful of power sellers fix prices to bilk Californians of billions of dollars? ??But it's not just the government that is busy. The companies themselves _ which have categorically denied any wrongdoing _ are overwhelmed by the scrutiny. ??""We are supplying reams and reams of documents. ... It is a distraction from our day-to-day work, there's no question,"" said Tom Williams of North Carolina-based Duke Energy, which operates several power plants in California. ""It affects our employees and their families, this barrage of innuendo. I don't know what more we can do."" ??Accompanying the investigations are at least a half-dozen lawsuits against the companies by individuals. Like the probes, the suits contend the companies improperly manipulated the market. Legislative leaders, meanwhile, have sued the federal government, contending it has failed to protect consumers from price-gouging. ??""This all permeates our business in so many ways,"" said Gary Ackerman of the Western States Power Forum, a group that represents power sellers and buyers in the West. ""It even affects my ability to talk to the newspapers, because we're afraid statements may turn up later and be used as evidence. We're not sure what we're dealing with, whether a suit or even a grand jury if the (attorney general) decides to take criminal action, as he said he might."" ??The state's top prosecutor said that, indeed, criminal charges are a possibility. ??""There is an investigation under way that involves potential criminal conduct,"" said Sandra Michioku, a spokeswoman for Attorney General Bill Lockyer. It could be at least eight weeks before that probe is completed, she said. ??Other investigating agencies include the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the California Public Utilities Commission, the city attorneys' offices in Long Beach, Los Angeles and San Francisco; California's grid manager, the Independent System Operator; the obscure Electricity Oversight Board, which oversees the ISO; and the state Senate and Assembly. ??The state has even considered asking two more federal agencies, the Department of Energy and the Federal Trade Commission, to get into the act. Some offices are conducting multiple investigations. In the case of at least two agencies, the PUC and the Attorney General's Office, the investigations are being at least partly coordinated. Some agencies are examining the same issues. The PUC, the attorney general and ISO, for example, all are looking at whether power plants were shut down to drive up demand and prices. ??""There is a lot of overlap and there probably are problems of coordination,"" said Nettie Hoge of The Utility Reform Network of San Francisco, a grass-roots watchdog group. ??With so many agencies trying to extract information, Hoge said, even those who have done no wrong are concerned about talking freely because of the greater likelihood that proprietary information will leak to competitors. ??Others feel the overlap is beneficial. ??""When you're up against an industry as wealthy and powerful as the energy industry, it's probably better to double-team them,"" said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. ??Hoge believes that if any investigation is going to produce results, it will be Lockyer's, ""because the governor has thrown all the resources that way."" ??Investigators have requested mountains of paperwork. Transaction and maintenance documents, market reports, financial records, even e-mails _ all have been sought. ??Martin Wilson, a spokesman for Texas-based Reliant, contends the intensity of the probes could have negative long-term effect on California's business climate. ??""There is a climate of instability and uncertainty that makes companies rethink their decisions about investments (in California),"" he said. ??But for consumer groups, the goal of all these investigations is straightforward. ??""Certainly, we're really hopeful that these investigations will lead to refunds for customers,"" said TURN's Mindy Spatz. ""There is a widespread belief among people who follow these issues that widespread gaming and manipulation has occurred in the market."" ??(c) 2001, The Orange County Register (Santa Ana, Calif.). ??Visit the Register on the World Wide Web at http://www.ocregister.com/ JOURNAL-CODE: OC LOAD-DATE: May 29, 2001 of 98 DOCUMENTS ?????????????????Copyright 2001 The Chronicle Publishing Co. ?????????????????????????The San Francisco Chronicle ?????????????????????MAY 29, 2001, TUESDAY, FINAL EDITION SECTION: NEWS; Pg.

Those that weren't blamed it all on that most familiar of modern scapegoats, the computer. ???Computers must be kept cool -- in the 60s for big mainframes and a bit more for the smaller units most folks use, though some can go into the 80s without hiccuping. So generally, people who work alongside the computers get to keep cool, by association, although it's the computer that counts. ???The ISO headquarters, located in an industrial park 20 miles east of Sacramento, is a delightfully cool and comfortable place when the outside temperature soars into the 90s and 100s. ???The reception area, the only room accessible to the outraged public, is a fairly stiff 76 degrees -- only two degrees cooler than the 78 degrees recommended by President Bush and the federal energy crisis czars and czarinas. ???But take a step past the lobby security doors and the temperature plummets. In the main hallway, the temperature is 73 degrees. And in the control room, where two dozen engineers and technicians sit at consoles and monitor the flow of California electricity on a giant diagram of state power lines so they can order blackouts for everyone else -- the temperature is 69 degrees. ???NO SWEATING AT ISO ???Some managers do not take off their sports coats and jackets. ???""We want these people to be comfortable,"" explained Tony Capasso, facilities manager for the ISO complex. ""We don't want these people sweating bullets in the middle of a crisis."" ???Inside the state Capitol, where legislators and the governor preach compliance with federal guidelines calling for 78-degree thermostats, the temperature dips into the high 60s. The coolest spots are the press briefing room and the treasurer's old office. ???GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ???The governor's suite is in the mid-70s, apparently because folks are often coming by with thermometers and it wouldn't do not to set an example. Press secretary Steve Maviglio said Governor Gray Davis is a practice-what-he-preaches kind of guy who keeps corridors dark, shades drawn, air conditioners idle. His personal secretary works in short sleeves, with a cheap plastic fan humming nearby. ???""It's so dark in the hall that we're always bumping into things,"" said one aide. ???Even so, the temperature in the governor's suite of offices is three degrees cooler than the 78 degrees recommended by President Bush -- not the first time the two men have failed to agree. ???THE LEGISLATURE ???The Assembly chamber is 71 degrees while the Senate chamber -- with 40 fewer legislators spewing forth -- is 73 degrees. But the Senate chamber has a southern exposure, one Capitol guide explained. ???""Hot air from the people sitting inside has nothing to do with it,"" he said. ???In San Francisco, the temperature inside cavernous City Hall dips in spots to the mid-60s. College student Jasmine Westbrook, who dropped by with her art class on a project to sketch the interior of the building, was doing her sketching while wearing a windbreaker to keep warm. ???""I want to stay comfortable,"" she said. ""It think it's supposed to be hotter in here, isn't it?"" ???The mayor's office, at 73 degrees, was eight degrees warmer than another office down the hall, even without the mayor sitting in it. ???63 AT THE PUC ???At the headquarters of the state Public Utilities Commission, which is supposed to be keeping an eye on the self-declared bankruptcy of the utility that mails out the bills, the lobby temperature is 63 degrees. ???Chief engineer David Omosheyin, eyeing The Chronicle's thermometer nervously, insisted the 63-degree reading was caused by the lobby's proximity to the front door, where the outside temperature at the moment was in the low 60s. He invited the thermometer to visit the upper floors, where the temperature was 70. ???As for San Francisco's federal buildings: Bush would probably not frown. ???His orders appeared to be followed during The Chronicle's visits, so much so that it was actually hotter inside than out. Though that wouldn't be hard, considering it was in the low 60s outside. And the places measured happened to be courtrooms and tax offices, where the body heat from anxiety alone could probably melt the paint some days. ???San Franciscans, Omosheyin said, are losing their perspective when it comes to things like electricity, energy alerts and rolling blackouts. In his native country of Nigeria, he said, the electricity runs sporadically, if at all. ???""There the power can go off for a week,"" he said. ""The world goes on. Here, people take a lot of things for granted, and electricity is one of them."" ???As for the offices of the places that report on such matters, they fared about the same. ???The Walnut Creek bureau of The Chronicle, where the sun sizzles into the 90s with regularity in the summer, is kept at 67 degrees because of all the computers.

Brad Sherman, a Democrat from Thousand Oaks who met Air Force One on the tarmac at Los Angeles International Airport along with a group of high school students, wasted no time button-holing the president for what appeared to be an animated conversation. ???""I brought up . . . the idea that after his meeting with our governor, I hoped he would be in favor of wholesale regulation (of energy prices),"" Sherman said later. ""He disagreed with me."" ???Sherman -- who two weeks ago suggested that the headline to the president's national energy policy should be ""Bush to California: Drop Dead"" -- didn't seem optimistic yesterday about Bush's 48-hour visit to the state. ""I think that the president's policies show either a lack of understanding of what's really going on in California, or a lack of concern,"" he said. ???That vignette underscored some of the challenges facing Bush, who arrived in California as protesters geared up and Democratic Gov. Gray Davis prepared to press him for federal action on the state's power troubles. ???Besides Sherman, Bush was greeted by a crowd of cheering Republicans, including Secretary of State Bill Jones and Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, the former a declared GOP candidate for governor in 2002, the latter a rumored one. ???But today, Bush will sit down with the present governor, who lately has been blistering in his criticism of the president. ???""The last time I looked, California was still part of the United States of America,"" Davis told reporters this weekend. ""We have contributed disproportionately to the economic growth of this country. There's no reason why a president should not respond to a legitimate request from the chief executive of the largest state in the union."" ???In his first visit to California since just before the election, Bush plans to emphasize the energy crisis -- but will focus on it through the lens of his own energy plan. ???ENERGY SECRETARY ACTS ???Just hours before the president landed, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham ordered a speedup in planning to relieve a notoriously overloaded electricity transmission line in California. ???Abraham's holiday action was timed to provide a bit of positive news for Bush to announce in California. He ordered the Western Area Power Administration, a 15-state marketing arm of the Energy Department, to complete planning and seek outside financing to reduce the transmission bottleneck on California's Path 15, which connects the northern and southern parts of the state. ???This morning, Bush will visit the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton, near San Diego, to underscore his conservation order for a 10 percent cut in energy usage in federal buildings and military facilities. ???In Los Angeles, he will deliver a wide-ranging talk before the World Affairs Council and lead a discussion among business leaders about technological advances in energy conservation. ???Then, he will head to Fresno and Sequoia National Park to press his initiative to improve national parks. Along the way, protesters have vowed to provide a vocal commentary on Bush's energy and environmental policies. ???But the real drama of the trip will no doubt be the sit-down between Bush and Davis today. The governor pushed for a lengthy, open meeting with Bush that would include testimony from officials and consumers affected by the energy crisis. Bush's camp announced Friday the meeting would be 20 to 30 minutes -- in private. ???Davis plans to outline steps the state has taken to alleviate the energy crisis, and what it wants the federal government to do -- including implementing price caps on the wholesale cost of energy, cost-based pricing, and the possibility of ordering refunds. ???DAVIS THREATENING SUIT ???The governor has said he will consider suing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission -- the agency charged with overseeing energy prices -- if it does not impose temporary price caps. ???And the state Legislature has already filed a suit, saying the commission has failed to stop what it has determined are ""unjust and unreasonable prices."" ???With California's energy woes worsening and a summer of rolling blackouts predicted, the Bush-Davis session holds potentially deep political pitfalls for both leaders, both of whom are suffering in state polls as a result of their handling of the energy crisis. ???Bush needs to demonstrate his concern for California, a state that gave a 12-point margin of victory to Al Gore in the presidential election. ???But even as Bush adviser Karen Hughes told state reporters this week that the president had arrived to show he cares, Vice President Dick Cheney again chastised state officials for delaying their response to the energy crisis ""because all of the action was potentially unpleasant."" ???And Cheney signaled that the administration would resist long-term price caps, saying, ""We think that's a mistake."" ???Such talk drew fire from Davis' senior political adviser, Garry South, who charged that Cheney's words demonstrated insensitivity to California's troubles and only underscored the perception of an ""all-oil, all-the-time ticket."" ???Davis, whose campaign for re-election next year will depend on his handling of the crisis, has stepped up his criticism of Bush and profit-hungry energy firms, particularly those from Texas, in recent weeks. ???And yesterday, signaling no letup, Davis' supporters made an unusual holiday conference call to again press his case for federal action. They argued that without immediate intervention from the Bush administration, the economy of California -- and potentially the entire nation -- was at risk. ???'THIS ENORMOUS SHOCK' ???""We have this enormous shock in prices that needs to be addressed and not ignored,"" said Joseph Fichero, head of Sabre Partners and a consultant to Davis. ???Alan Blinder, a Princeton economist and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned that energy woes in California alone would ""take almost a half a percent of the gross domestic product off of the national economy."" ???Blinder and others argue that short-term relief -- for about 6 to 12 months -- is necessary while new power plants are being built. ???""Most times and most places, I agree price caps are not the long-run solution, but they can be part of a short-term solution,"" Blinder said. ""There really is a case for temporary price caps to shield consumers and the California and national economy from the full force of the energy shock."" ???Limited new price caps approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on the sale of wholesale electricity begin today in California. But the temporary caps, which go into effect when the electricity reserves dip below 7.5 percent, have been lambasted by Davis as ineffective and inadequate. ???Political analysts say Bush's resistence on the issue could cost him in California -- and elsewhere. ???""(California) is probably an area where he is criticized more than any other region in the country,"" said Mark DiCamillo, director of the statewide Field Poll.

Gray Davis will urge President Bush today to back a 2-year cap on electricity costs as the best way to keep his power-starved state -- and possibly the U.S. economy -- from sinking into recession. ???The Democratic governor and Republican president, who have been sparring from afar over energy policy, will meet here to discuss their differences. The White House has said repeatedly that it opposes price caps as a way to deal with energy shortages in California. ??In an interview with USA TODAY, Davis said a limit on wholesale electricity costs is needed while the state attempts to build 15 new power plants. He said that would still allow a 30% profit margin. ??""While the president didn't create this problem, he is uniquely situated to solve it,"" Davis said. ""I'll make clear that he has an opportunity to relieve the pain and give California the breathing space to put more plants online."" ???Bush, making his first visit to California as president, unveiled a long-term energy policy this month that calls for increased production and, to a lesser extent, conservation. The president will promote conservation steps being taken by the federal government during a visit today to the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton. ??""The president believes that imposing price caps will only make the problem worse,"" White House spokesman Dan Bartlett said. ??Davis, whose popularity has plummeted as Californians cope with blackouts to offset electricity shortages, said his state's problems could hurt all Americans if they are not dealt with quickly. ""I'm asking for some form of relief that reduces the outrageous prices we're currently bearing,"" he said. ""Without that relief, lots of people will lose their businesses, and California could well be dragged into a recession. Since we're about one-eighth of the national economy, that doesn't bode well for America."" ???The California Public Utilities Commission has announced rate increases of up to 50% for businesses and 37% for homes. ??Bush has sidestepped California after losing the state by 12 percentage points to Democrat Al Gore last year in the presidential election. But with Democrats targeting several GOP House members in next year's elections, Republicans must go on the offensive or risk losing control of the closely divided House of Representatives. ??Davis, a possible presidential candidate in 2004, said he wants to avoid rancor with Bush: ""I'm saying, 'Look, we got into this in a bipartisan way.

Gray Davis (D) on Tuesday. Bush's aides said he will pledge to cooperate with California but will stick to his position that no action by the federal government can prevent the rolling blackouts expected this summer. ???Abraham ordered the Western Area Power Administration, a 15-state marketing arm of his department, to complete planning and seek outside financing for an increase in transmission capacity that he said would be ""a big step in the right direction, and a big step forward for Californians."" ???""California's electricity problems developed over a period of years and cannot be solved overnight,"" Abraham said in a news release. ""However, we can move now on actions that will help avert the same types of problems from recurring year after year."" Today's action is designed to reduce the bottleneck on California's Path 15, which connects the northern and southern parts of the state. ???Davis, who is seeking reelection next year, has seen his poll ratings plummet as electricity prices soared, utilities hit dire financial straits, and homes and businesses were surprised with blackouts. ???Bush has taken several steps to try to encourage additional power generation in the state but has maintained since before he took office that California's problems were created here -- through a troubled effort at electricity deregulation and public opposition to construction of additional power plants -- and would have to be solved here. ???Davis plans to use the meeting to lobby Bush once again to endorse a cap by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on the wholesale price of electricity. Again and again, the administration has said it will not take that step. ???""This administration does not, and will not, support energy price controls,"" Bush told a business audience in March. ""Price controls do not increase supply, and they do not encourage conservation. Price controls contributed to the gas lines of the 1970s.

As Bush departs, Davis plans to make an immediate statement for cameras. ???Although Bush says he has taken more than a dozen steps to help California, Davis says price caps are essential, and has said he may sue the federal government in an effort to get them if Bush does not go along. ???""He has been helpful on a number of small matters, and I appreciate his assistance,"" Davis said during a telephone interview on Friday.

For the average home, a photovoltaic package costs between $ 10,000 and $ 20,000, parts and labor included, before the rebate. ???How many have been installed? ???At last count, about 40. ???That leaves only 99,960 rooftops to go. ???The Bush administration, and especially Vice President Cheney, architect of its energy plan, have been criticized for skepticism regarding alternative energy sources. But a close examination of the Los Angeles solar experiment and a review of similar programs suggest the former oilmen in the White House have a point: Solar, at least, has not proven ready for prime time. ???For all of Los Angeles's good intentions, and for all of solar's many positive attributes, the problems of harnessing its power remain. Some of those challenges are economic and some technological; others are more mundane, but often ignored, such as finding a qualified contractor a homeowner can trust to drill dozens of holes in the roofs to mount the things. ???In a reprise of the 1980s, solar again is hot. The price of photovoltaics is dropping and interest is growing. Other states such as New York, Arizona, Florida and Washington are moving to join California in major efforts to wire homes to draw power from the sun. ???But as many Americans are beginning to understand, the delivery of energy is like a complex, interconnected assembly line, and the devil lurks in the details. ???The Los Angeles experiment tells the story shared by other locales. In L.A., for example, the city's lone solar panel manufacturer has not been able to supply enough systems to meet demand. ???The systems, too, are often oversold by solar proponents. In the real world, most do not pay for themselves in a few years, as some advocates claim, but take 20 years or more to return their initial cost in the form of reduced utility bills. ???Nor are the systems maintenance-free: At a minimum, the rooftop panels must be routinely cleaned of pollution, dust and leaves. ???They cannot be installed efficiently on homes without shade-free, south-facing roofs; the shadow from a neighbor's palm tree can frustrate the system's photovoltaic cells. ???Nor will the most common systems allow buyers to live ""off the grid,"" unless they want to purchase a large bank of batteries. Even with the batteries, homeowners probably would not be able to run their washing machines and air conditioners at the same time. ???""It is not an economic proposition at this point,"" conceded Terry Peterson, a solar expert at Electric Power Research Institute in Palo Alto, Calif. But one day, Peterson predicts, 100 years from now, solar energy will provide a substantial percentage of the world's energy needs. In a decade or two, the cost of solar will likely be competitive with other energy sources such as natural gas, nuclear or coal. ???But now? It is still a luxury item. ""Like buying a swimming pool,"" Peterson said. ???""I really like the idea of running my house with solar power,"" said Andrew Chin, a potential customer in Los Angeles who has been researching a purchase. ""But they're still pretty expensive, even with the rebates, and so I gotta ask myself, what am I doing this for,"" his conscience or his wallet. ""I'm thinking I might wait until they work the kinks out."" ???The most knowledgeable and experienced solar contractor in Los Angeles is probably Graham Owen, the founder, owner and single full-time employee of Go Solar Co. ???His installation of a one-kilowatt solar electric system on a home in the San Fernando Valley was the first to be awarded a rebate by the Los Angeles power department in March. ???How many systems has he installed as part of the rebate program? Three. ???But Owen is a true believer, and over the next year, he plans to cover hundreds of roofs with solar panels. On his shelf, Owen still has an unreturned library book, ""The Coming Age of Solar Energy,"" published in 1963, and checked out from his high school in Lennox Hills, Ill., in 1979. ""I guess we're still stuck in the coming age of solar energy,"" he said, smiling. He recalled that the buzz about solar water heaters in the 1980s led to disappointment with shoddy workmanship and less than spectacular energy savings. ???Until recently, there has been little widespread interest in solar electric power. Since 1998, the California Energy Commission has been pushing its own program to encourage homeowners to erect photovoltaic panels on their roofs, offering to subsidize about one-third of the cost. ???Across a state with a population of about 35 million, only 450 solar energy systems have been installed on homes. ???Then the California energy crisis struck, with its power interruptions and steep rate increases, and the phone calls began to overwhelm Owen's voice mail. ???""On days with rolling blackouts? I get a hundred calls, maybe more,"" Owen says. His Web site, www.solarexpert.com, is now receiving 3,000 hits a day. Customers are begging him to do jobs. ???The Los Angeles power department reports a similar surge in interest since the energy crisis began six months ago. ""Customer demand has shot through the roof,"" says Angelina Galiteva, executive director for strategic planning at the Department of Water and Power. She estimates that her department receives 1,000 calls on some days about its solar subsidy program. ???Yet while the reliability and cost of solar electric technologies continue to improve, solar power today accounts for only a sliver of the national pie chart of energy production -- less than 1 percent. The country produces about 300 megawatts of electricity with solar -- about the same amount produced by a single mid-sized traditional power plant. ???The current trend for photovoltaics is not to erect large centralized solar farms in the desert, an experiment that withered in the 1980s, but to pursue ""distributed generation"" or individual units on scattered rooftops. ???The problem has consistently been the cost of the solar panels, which has been too steep to justify them, except for customers who are committed environmentalists or techies who like the elegance of the systems. ???Los Angeles began its solar experiment after Sacramento legislators mandated that utilities spend about 3 percent of their revenue on efficiency, conservation and renewable energy. For solar, the power department committed $ 75 million over the next five years -- enough to subsidize panels on 7,500 homes. ???The power department will pay $ 5 for each watt of solar installed on a residence or business. Homeowners typically purchase a one-kilowatt or two- kilowatt (1,000 or 2,000 watts, respectively) solar electric system, meaning that the municipal utility would pay between $ 5,000 and $ 10,000 of the cost up front -- an enticing, tax-free offer. ???""For many years, I wanted to do solar, but it was so expensive,"" said LaWanda Geary in the San Fernando Valley, who in April had Owen install 32 panels for a two-kilowatt system on her sunny roof. ""The rebate really got me going. I don't know many times when the government offers to pay half of anything."" ???The systems that are eligible for rebates must be tied into a utility's electric power grid, meaning that during the day, when the sun is shining, the panels are adding a stream of electrons used by the home to run its lights and appliances. ???If there is a surplus of solar power, that electricity goes back into the power lines and is passed along to a neighbor, and the electric meter at the house actually runs backward. Homeowners, however, are not selling their excess electricity -- they're giving it away to the utility company. ???On cloudy days, and at night, the home is not being powered by solar energy, but getting its electricity the traditional way from the power lines. ???Calculations on savings vary. A two-kilowatt solar system can supply an average-sized home with 20 to 80 percent of its electrical needs, depending on how many lights, appliances and air conditioners are running, and how efficient they are. ???After the subsidy, and depending on how the system is paid for (in cash or with borrowed funds), a solar system can pay for itself in as little as six years and as much as 36 years. Owen assumes about 20 years. ???Potential solar clients, moreover, often mistakenly assume that going with the sun will take them off the grid, which is not possible without a large bank of batteries that costs several thousand dollars more. Because the solar panels are still wired to the power grid, if there is a blackout, the power in a solar house goes off, just like everyone else's. If uninterrupted power is needed, Owen suggests a diesel generator. ???Galiteva does cite one real advantage of solar: It reduces the electricity that must be purchased from power companies and protects, to some degree, a solar home from the full brunt of upwardly spiraling rate increases. Unfortunately for solar enthusiasts, the L.A. Department of Water and Power, which was not deregulated along with the three other major utilities in California, has perhaps the cheapest and most stable supply of electricity in the state, making the economic argument harder to make. ???To receive the full $ 5 per watt subsidy, the L.A. Department of Water and Power requires a homeowner to purchase solar panels from a manufacturer based in the city. The idea is not only to become the solar capital of the world but also to encourage local growth of an emerging industry and create jobs. ???One hitch is that no solar panel makers were located in Los Angeles. ???After lengthy negotiations, Siemens Solar Industries, based in Camarillo, Calif., an hour's drive to the north, announced in February that it would open a solar panel manufacturing plant in Los Angeles. But it is not a complete facility: The L.A. plant does only some final assembly and then the units must be returned to Camarillo for final testing and shipping. ???Tina Nickerson, a spokeswoman for Siemens Solar, estimates her company has sold ""a couple dozen"" to L.A. homeowners for the rebate program. But she, too, reports that the interest from consumers is sometimes overwhelming and that supply has been a problem. Most U.S.-manufactured units are shipped overseas to places such as Germany, Japan and Scandinavia, which have had generous subsidies in place for years. ???LaWanda Geary had to call Siemens herself to push them to deliver panels for her house -- and she was eligible for the rebate because of a stopgap compromise that allows to Siemens to ship solar panels from Camarillo until its L.A. plant is fully operational. ???Everyone involved concedes there have been bottlenecks. Siemens now says it has enough panels to begin to meet demand, and Owen and the city are hoping things will sort themselves out, especially if more solar manufacturers are drawn to Los Angeles. But proponents worry about what will happen when the subsidies run out. ???""Selling solar is now the easy part,"" Owen says. ""I could sell a hundred a week. It's getting them up on the roof that's the hard part."" LOAD-DATE: May 29, 2001 of 98 DOCUMENTS ????????????????Copyright 2001 News World Communications, Inc.

And the winter came, and they stopped reproducing. ?And then, somewhere around February or March, I learned about something called 'spring emergence.' As the ground got warmer, the larvae turned into flies and more medflies started appearing. It got out of hand, and ultimately I had to order malathion spraying. ?It would have been better had I taken forceful action at the first notice of the medfly."" ??Mr. ?Foster asked: ""Are you saying that the governor missed opportunities to act early, in the same way?"" ??Mr. ?Brown replied: ""There's an analogy there. ?I didn't want to spray because I knew the people in Santa Clara County didn't want to have helicopters spraying malathion over their homes. ?It didn't sound good. ?As governor, I wouldn't have wanted to see rate increases either. ?But sometimes you have to take your medicine early. ?It's less bitter than if you postpone it."" ??Mr. ?Davis served as Mr. ?Brown's chief of staff when the latter Democrat was governor. ??ENERGETIC CRITICISM ??President Bush's energy plan, already under fire from Democrats and environmentalists, is dismissed by National Review, the conservative magazine, as so much political posturing. ??""The hyperbolic attacks on the Bush plan by environmentalists (as an attempt to poison the air and kill the caribou) shouldn't trick conservatives into an exaggerated sense of its merit,"" the magazine says in an editorial in its current issue, dated June 11. ??""The basic thrust of the administration's thinking on energy is sound: a growing economy requires more energy, which in turn entails more production. But the Bush plan itself is a political document, meant to placate corporate interests, environmentalists, and everyone in between, and so is festooned with an embarrassment of subsidies and incentives that will, at best, prove an irrelevance. ??""As Jerry Taylor of the Cato Institute writes in this issue, the phantom energy crisis is already healing itself. ?Power plants are being built at a rate that outpaces Dick Cheney's benchmark of one plant a week. Altogether, almost 100,000 new daily megawatts of electrcity capacity are scheduled to be available nationwide by next year. ?This is twice the amount of electricity that California now uses on an average day. ?While Cheney has been sitting with his advisers around a White House conference table, investors and entrepreneurs have been digging, building, and refining his energy problem into oblivion. ?By the time all the Bush plan's tax credits have kicked in, there may well be an energy glut. ?All of this is thanks to the most efficient energy plan known to man: market pricing."" ??WRONG ON BOTH COUNTS ??""The buzz in the media after Sen. ?James Jeffords' switch put Democrats in control of the Senate was that President Bush must change his ways. ?He has to become more moderate. ?Why? ?Because only that will prevent more Republican defections and it's the president's one hope for getting his agenda through Congress. ?This is wrong on both counts,"" Fred Barnes writes in the Weekly Standard. ??""Bush and GOP congressional leaders bent over backwards to accommodate Jeffords and liberal Democrats on education, the senator's top priority. Jeffords bolted anyway. ?On taxes, Bush stuck with his conservative tax cut until nearly the end, when he compromised just enough to assure passage. Jeffords voted with him,"" Mr. ?Barnes said. ??""The truth about the impact of Jeffords' move is that no political earthquake has occurred. ?The Senate is ideologically unchanged. ?The swing votes in the Senate, including John McCain, are important, but they already were. ?There's no clear path to victory for the Bush agenda, after taxes and education, but that was always true. ?To pass a patients' bill of rights, a prescription-drug benefit, or missile defense, a bipartisan coalition of some sort will be essential. ??""Yes, there's one big change with Democrats taking over: judges. ?Bush will have a harder time getting conservative nominees through a Senate Judiciary Committee run by Patrick Leahy, perhaps the most partisan Democrat on Capitol Hill. ?One more downbeat side effect: Jeffords' announcement overshadowed Bush's tax-cut victory, denying him any political momentum he might have gotten from it."" ??INCOHERENT REBEL ??""Before liberals put James Jeffords on Mount Rushmore, can we please stop and note how he's already betrayed Democrats and his own avowed principles by deciding that his defection won't take effect until after President Bush's wrongheaded tax cut has been signed into law?"" syndicated columnist Matthew Miller writes. ??""Any traitor (I mean, 'man of conscience') worth his salt shoves the knife in to the hilt - otherwise, what's the point? ?Machiavellis throughout history have wisely advised that when you move against the king, you'd better finish him off,"" Mr. ?Miller said. ??""Yet Jeffords took pains to make sure his switch wouldn't derail the centerpiece of Bush's agenda, the very agenda that inspired Jeffords' move and which Jeffords had the power to stop via his action. ??""We are dealing, in other words, with a deeply incoherent rebel. ?This would be a private matter for Jeffords to sort out with his therapist were not his cowardice in this moment of 'courage' so consequential for the country."" ??THE LONELY VERMONTER ??""In the final analysis, Vermont Sen. ?James M. ?Jeffords was out of step with his party, making his departure appropriate, if politically inconvenient. ?Those who argue that it was the party out of step with Jeffords, some political analysts are saying, are those who wish the Republicans no good."" UPI political analyst Peter Roff writes. ??""The conservative, low-tax, minimal-government Republican Party enjoys national parity with the Democrats, something the Northeastern liberal GOP could not achieve. ?Jeffords is, in that regard, these observers say, out of step with victory. ?One GOP consultant went so far as to say, 'If the Republicans were doing better in New England, Jeffords would not have been so lonely. ?Why is it that the people from states where the GOP usually doesn't win think they can tell the rest of us how to run the party and what we all should believe? ?It doesn't make sense.'

Both Mr. Bush and Vice President Richard B. ?Cheney, who on Friday again blamed the state government of California for the energy crunch, oppose cap measures. ??In his first visit to California since the presidential election, where he lost the state to former Vice President Al Gore by 54 percent to 41 percent, Mr. Bush hopes to sell his national energy policy to a vocal group of opponents. But the hue and cry has been muted of late since residents have battled rolling blackouts and sky-high gasoline prices. ??A new poll released Friday shows 59 percent of Californians, many of whom have been longtime foes of nuclear energy, now believe the non-polluting energy source may be the way to solve the state's problems. ??Mr. ?Davis' popularity has plummeted. ?The Democrat, facing re-election next year and often mentioned as a presidential candidate, is viewed as having ""poor job performance"" by 60 percent of Californians, according to a survey by the Public Policy Institute of California. ??In a small gesture to California, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham yesterday announced plans to increase transmission capacity in California, which he said would be a ""big step"" in easing rolling power blackouts. ??Abraham ordered the Western Area Power Administration - an Energy Department arm responsible for marketing electricity from federal water projects in 15 Western states - to wrap up planning for building extra transmission capacity. ??The governor has repeatedly blamed Mr. ?Bush, who took office four months ago, for the energy crunch in California. ?He points the finger of blame far outside the state's boundaries, primarily at Washington and Mr. Bush's home state. ??""The people that have dropped the ball are the federal government,"" Mr. Davis said last week. ?""They need to reimpose a price cap because we're being obscenely gouged by price gougers out of Texas and the Southwest. ?. . . There's a massive transfer of wealth going on from ordinary citizens in California to Texas."" ??Mr. ?Davis has also charged that utility companies are withholding power in order to drive up prices, a claim the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has investigated and dismissed. ??Mr. ?Bush and Mr. ?Cheney have often pointed out that California is second only to Rhode Island in conservation efforts, but the state is on the brink of an energy supply collapse. ??Still, despite the state's failure to build new power plants, Mr. Davis says California is entitled to a federal bailout approved by Mr. Bush. ??""I'm going to keep asking him to do it because we're part of America. The state, the last three years, has led American economic growth. ?. . . We're doing everything we can out here,"" he said. ??In the Democratic response to the president's weekly radio address, Mr. Davis accused the president, a former oil man, of being concerned only with the petroleum magnates. ??""With all due respect, I urge you to stand up to your friends in the energy business and exercise the federal government's exclusive responsibility to ensure that energy prices are reasonable,"" he said. ??Many analysts, however, blame the state's deregulation scheme and failure to construct adequate electrical generating capacity. ?The price wholesale power providers can charge utilities is not capped, but the fee those companies can charge users is capped - resulting in massive debt for providers. ??The state was slow to respond to increased demand, the analysts say, even though the state is building 10 new power plants, four of which will come on line this summer. ??In his national energy policy, Mr. ?Bush lays out 105 proposals that focus on increasing domestic supply, improving the nation's ability to move energy between regions and increased conservation. ?But the policy is geared more toward long-term solutions - such as decreasing America's reliance on foreign oil - than short-term relief for Californians and motorists nationwide. ??Mr. ?Cheney, who heads the president's energy task force and said Friday that California knew ""for more than a year"" about the impending energy shortage, has promoted nuclear power as essential to America's energy needs. ?He said that at least some of the 65 power plants that need to be built annually to meet future electricity demand ought to be nuclear. ??A poll by the Field Institute last week found many Californians now agree. Although nuclear energy produces 20 percent of the nation's energy, California has just two nuclear plants.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES BODY: ??President Bush promised World War II veterans a Washington memorial that ""will stand for the ages"" and paid Memorial Day tribute to America's fallen soldiers before embarking on a three-day West Coast swing to try to ease his political problems in California. ??Bush landed at ground zero of the nation's energy worries Monday night, hours after Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham speeded up planning to relieve a notoriously overloaded electricity transmission line through California. ? ??Abraham's action was timed to provide a bit of news for Bush to announce during his first presidential trip to California, where he is to hold a politically charged private meeting with Democratic Gov. Gray Davis on Tuesday. Bush's aides said he will pledge to cooperate with California but will stick to his position that no action by the federal government can prevent the rolling blackouts that are expected this summer. ??Abraham ordered the Western Area Power Administration, a 15-state marketing arm of his department, to complete planning and seek outside financing for an increase in transmission capacity that he said would be ""a big step in the right direction, and a big step forward for Californians."" ??""California's electricity problems developed over a period of years and cannot be solved overnight,"" Abraham said in a news release. ""However, we can move now on actions that will help avert the same types of problems from recurring year after year."" Monday's action is designed to reduce the bottleneck on California's Path 15, which connects the northern and southern parts of the state. ??Davis, who is seeking re-election next year, has seen his poll ratings plummet as electricity prices soared, utilities hit dire financial straits and homes and businesses were surprised with blackouts. ??For most of Monday, however, Bush focused on U.S. veterans and the solemn ceremonies in two states honoring those who never returned from America's wars. ??""Their losses can be marked, but not measured,"" Bush said at the traditional Memorial Day ceremonies at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. ""We can never measure the full value of what was gained in their sacrifice. We live it every day, in the comforts of peace and the gifts of freedom."" ??Bush also laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns. ??Later he traveled to Mesa, Ariz., to pay tribute to veterans at the Champlin Fighter Aircraft Museum. He asked the crowd to observe a nationwide moment of silence at 3 p.m. Arizona time. ??""Any foe who might challenge our national resolve will be repeating the grave error of defeated adversaries,"" the president said. ??Bush opened the day at the White House, where he signed legislation to construct a World War II monument on the National Mall, a setting criticized by some. Bush said the monument between the Washington Monument and Lincoln Memorial ""will stand for the ages."" ??""I will make sure the monument gets built,"" the president told an audience of veterans in the yellow-curtained East Room, among them former Sen.

Gray Davis doesn't want to hear: He won't force down soaring electricity prices that have cost California nearly $8 billion since January. ??The Republican president and the embattled Democratic governor arranged a 20-meeting Tuesday to talk about California's energy crisis, but there was no indication they would break their stalemate. ??Bush opposes price limits on wholesale electricity that utilities buy, arguing they do nothing to address supply-and-demand issues at the heart of the crisis. ??Davis contends federal energy regulators are ignoring their mandate to ensure ""just and fair"" electricity prices. ??With no sign of a break in the deadlock, each side maneuvered for maximum advantage from Bush's first full day in California as president. ??Davis, in an interview Tuesday on ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" defended his record on licensing more power plants. ??""We've licensed 15 plants. Ten are under construction, four will be online this summer, four next summer, and by the end of 2003 we will have built our way out of this problem. But between now and then, we are getting gouged unbelievably,"" Davis said. ??The Bush administration timed positive energy announcements to coincide with the president's visit. ??At the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton, Bush was announcing the expansion of a program that provides federal money to help low-income residents pay for power. ??Bush was proposing $150 million, in addition to $300 million already budgeted for a component of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, to provide special help to cash-strapped residents of California and certain Midwest areas such as Chicago, a senior administration aide said. ??Bush was also reminding state residents of his order that military facilities in the state cut peak-hour usage by 10 percent. ??To alleviate an electricity bottleneck on a crucial south-north transmission path, the Department of Energy announced that the Western Area Power Authority will try to raise money from a variety of private and public entities to finance a crucial additional lines. ??""The Bush administration is taking a leadership role in addressing a long-neglected problem in California's electricity transmission system,"" said Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham. ""California's electricity problems developed over a period of years and cannot be solved overnight. However, we can move now on actions that will help avert the same types of problems from recurring year after year."" ??Davis had a letter for Bush from top economists who maintain price caps are justified and necessary. ??Aides to the governor expressed amazement that Bush would travel all the way to California with no major announcement in hand, and predicted Davis would respond with ""polite rage."" ??Mindful of the national stage he commanded, Davis planned a news conference to air his grievances. And he convened a panel of families he said have been victimized by the energy crisis in the same hotel where Bush was staying. ??Davis wants Bush to pressure the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose stiff price caps. ??Tuesday, limited caps ordered last month by FERC go into effect in California, but only when electricity reserves fall below 7.5 percent in the state - a step Davis called inadequate. ??Protesters planned demonstrations in Los Angeles and at Camp Pendleton, in San Diego County. ??Bush also arranged a speech on energy and trade to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council and planned to president over a closed-door energy round-table discussion.

Gray Davis was to meet President Bush to press for a federal cap on energy prices. ??But Davis wasn't expected to win any concessions during the 20-minute Tuesday meeting where he's expected to point to Texas energy makers. ??Davis has appeared on national news programs attacking Bush for opposing price controls on wholesale electricity, and suggesting the president has ignored price-gouging by Texas-based electricity generators. ??""The president did not create this problem, but he is uniquely situated to solve it,"" Davis said Monday. ""What I'm going to ask him to do, with all respect, is to enforce federal law. The money that leaves this state goes directly to energy companies in Texas and the Southwest."" ??If Bush refuses to administer price controls as expected, Davis can use that as ammunition in his sparring with the administration. ??Bush has blamed California officials for the state's power woes and said price controls won't solve shortages. Instead, they said, Bush plans to stress his efforts to conserve energy in federal buildings and will bring one or two new initiatives to the table. ??One of them commits the federal government to helping organize a consortium to build more power lines for the state. ??Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham directed the Western Area Power Administration, a federal agency, to take the first steps to clear the way for building more transmission capacity between southern and northern California. That would help relieve a transmission bottleneck in the central part of the state. ??While this will not help this summer, Abraham said in a statement the line improvements, when completed, ""will help avert the same types of problems from recurring year after year."" ??The stakes of the meeting are high for both politicians. ??Davis, who has been mentioned as a Democratic challenger to Bush in 2004, wants federal help to solve an energy crunch that threatens rolling outages this summer and has cost state taxpayers nearly $8 million since January - the price of buying power for two cash-starved private utilities. And his plan to rescue one of those companies reportedly is faltering. ??Leaders of both the state Senate and Assembly oppose a $3 billion-plus plan to bail out Southern California Edison by buying its power lines, the Los Angeles Times reported Monday. ??Bush, meanwhile, needs to mend fences in vote-heavy California. The Republican president lost badly here in November, and polls show most Californians dislike his handling of their energy crisis. ??Bush's Tuesday agenda was heavy on energy issues. At the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton, near San Diego, Bush was to highlight his order that federal agencies and installations cut back energy use. Then it was on to Los Angeles to discuss his energy plan in a speech to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council. ??Bush was confronted by the issue virtually as he stepped off the plane Monday in Los Angeles. Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Los Angeles, escorted the Academic Decathlon national championship team from El Camino Real High School in Woodland Hills to meet Bush. He told the president California needs regulation of electric generators. ??""The president seems to believe just by instinct that rate regulation reduces supply and also by instinct that all those in the energy industry are fair people who are not trying to game the system,"" Sherman said.

Gray Davis' plan for solving the energy crisis relies partly on a=20 striking assumption: that the state's power expenditures will drop=20 dramatically this summer.=20 But energy-market analysts believe Davis is underestimating the cost of=20 electricity and say the state should brace for a significant run-up in pric= es=20 during what is likely to be a summer of chronic shortages.=20 In particular, analysts question Davis' prediction the state will pay an=20 average of $195 a megawatt-hour on the spot market from July to September, = a=20 44 percent reduction from the projected average price for April through Jun= e.=20 ""One hundred and ninety-five dollars?

""My estimate i= s=20 substantially higher.""=20 Yet Davis' advisers are sticking by their projection of the state's power= =20 costs, released Monday to a skeptical Legislature by private consultants to= =20 the governor. They say the lower cost estimates reflect expected increases = in=20 supplies, the projected impact of California's new conservation program and= =20 the state's growing ability to wean itself from the ultra-expensive spot=20 market and buy much of its power through cheaper long-term contracts.=20 Prices may rise, but spending by the state will decline, starting this=20 summer, they insist.=20 ""This is a very credible plan,"" said Joseph Fichera, a Wall Street financie= r=20 advising the governor. ""We have done things to mitigate our exposure (to th= e=20 spot market).""=20 The credibility of the projections is crucial to the state's plan to sell $= 10=20 billion worth of bonds -- a key element of Davis' rescue plan. The bonds=20 would compensate the state for past and future power purchases made on beha= lf=20 of moribund Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co., wi= th=20 ratepayers ultimately footing the bill. Davis expects the state to spend=20 $18.7 billion on power by June 2002.=20 But if electricity costs go higher than Davis expects, the strain on the=20 state's budget could worsen, complicating the bond sale.

On Thursday, prices in California ranged= =20 between $214 and $240 a megawatt-hour, depending on location, for peak-time= =20 power, according to industry newsletter Enerfax Daily.=20 Because summertime demand is typically about 50 percent higher than it is i= n=20 spring, most analysts expect prices to rise.

""They've been right more often= =20 than the Davis administration.""=20 The Northwest drought, robbing California of cheap hydropower, is a key=20 reason many analysts believe costs won't drop.=20 ""What it all adds up to is much less imported hydroelectric power than we'r= e=20 used to,"" said Arthur O'Donnell, editor of the California Energy Markets=20 newsletter.=20 But Davis' consultants say new power is coming from other sources this=20 summer, easing prices. New power plants, scheduled to begin operations this= =20 summer, will add 4,500 megawatts of power to California's energy-starved=20 grid, Davis said.=20 O'Donnell, though, said the new plants won't provide immediate relief. ""Pow= er=20 plants, in their start-up phase, frequently have problems,"" he said.=20 Another unknown quantity is the fate of hundreds of cogenerators, wind farm= s=20 and other alternative-energy providers that deliver more than 20 percent of= =20 the state's electricity under contract to the utilities.=20 After going months without payment from PG&E and Edison, scores of these=20 producers shut down in February and March, depriving the state of an=20 estimated 3,000 megawatts of power and contributing mightily to two days of= =20 blackouts in March.=20 About 800 megawatts of power returned to service in April, after PG&E and= =20 Edison were ordered to resume paying the generators, the two utilities said= .=20 And Fichera said more will come back starting June 1, when their contracts= =20 say they must operate or face financial penalties.=20 But some generators say they won't produce full throttle this summer.

Recently=20 approved rate hikes will create ""sticker shock"" that will cut demand 3=20 percent, Fichera said. The state's conservation program will contribute an= =20 additional 4 percent, he said.=20 ""If we buy less than what (generators) expect, prices drop,"" Davis said.=20 Above all, the state has completed or is in final negotiations on a slew of= =20 long-term contracts with major generators -- deals that will substantially= =20 cut the state's dependence on the spot market and reduce its overall power= =20 bill, said Ron Nichols of Navigant Consulting Inc., which developed the=20 power-cost estimates for Davis.=20 The Bee's Dale Kasler can be reached at (916) 321-1066 or dkasler@sacbee.co= m.=20 David Whitney of The Bee's Washington Bureau contributed to this report.=20 GOP: Shrink plan for bonds By John Hill Bee Capitol Bureau (Published May 4, 2001)=20 The state should bite the bullet and use $5 billion of its surplus to pay f= or=20 electricity instead of borrowing the money and prolonging the fiscal agony,= =20 Assembly Republicans said Thursday.=20 Paying up front is preferable to a Democratic plan that would ""saddle=20 electric customers with higher utility rates to pay the state back with=20 interest,"" said Assemblyman Bill Leonard of San Bernardino, one of 30 membe= rs=20 of the Assembly Republican Caucus.=20 But the caucus's plan drew fire from state Treasurer Phil Angelides, a=20 Democrat in charge of putting together the bond deal. He said a GOP block o= f=20 the bond deal would cut into this year's spending for education and=20 transportation and ""take the state toward fiscal insolvency.""=20 Angelides said the Republican stance will force the Legislature to pass the= =20 bill authorizing bonds with a simple majority, needing no GOP votes but=20 requiring a 90-day wait for the bill to become law. By that time, he said,= =20 the state will be perilously close to running out of money.=20 ""It is to me, from a business perspective, one of the most irresponsible ac= ts=20 I've witnessed,"" he said.=20 The Assembly Republican plan calls for the state to sell $8 billion in bond= s,=20 instead of the $12.5 billion proposed by Gov. Gray Davis. This move would= =20 relieve pressure for more electricity rate increases, Leonard said.=20 The Republicans would make up the difference by taking $5 billion from the= =20 state's general fund. That's money the Democratic governor proposed in=20 January would go to one-time expenditures on a variety of projects, from=20 clean beaches to housing, as well as new spending on schools.=20 The Republican plan calls for rate rebates for people whose electric=20 utilities are publicly owned, such as the Sacramento Municipal Utility=20 District. Some argue that these ratepayers are getting a bad deal because= =20 their tax money is subsidizing ratepayers whose utilities are in financial= =20 trouble.=20 It also includes past Republican proposals that have stagnated in the=20 Legislature, such as allowing residential customers to make deals with=20 independent electricity providers and encouraging quick building of power= =20 plants.=20 Although the Republicans are in the minority, they wield leverage in the=20 energy debate because a bill that would authorize a bond sale requires a=20 two-thirds vote. At least five of the 30 Assembly Republicans would have to= =20 vote for it.=20 The Republicans say they are uncomfortable with the size of the bond deal= =20 proposed by Davis, which combined with other energy bond sales could top $2= 0=20 billion. ""It's too much to swallow,"" said James Fisfis, a spokesman for the= =20 caucus.=20 Fisfis said the plan represents a preliminary response to Democratic=20 proposals -- a ""starting point in negotiations and a vision of Republicans= =20 and what they would do if they were governing.""=20 ""We don't want those phony messages that everything's fine and hunky-dory,= =20 and it's not,"" he said. ""This is a time for financial restraint.""=20 The Republican proposal blasts as ""expensive gimmickry"" a plan by Angelides= =20 to get a $4.1 billion bridge loan from three major lenders to keep the stat= e=20 flush until the bonds are sold.=20 Angelides said such loans are routine when California and other states sell= =20 bonds.

They= =20 say the plan is full of dangerously optimistic assumptions, such as estimat= es=20 that 90% of the state's alternative energy producers will be generating=20 electricity this summer--only two-thirds are now--and that Californians wil= l=20 use 7% less electricity. ?????Although Republicans don't control either house, the emergency=20 legislation requires a two-thirds vote, which gives the GOP significant swa= y. ?????The plan from the Republican leadership would commit taxpayer money fo= r=20 the first time to an electricity problem that has only affected customers o= f=20 private utilities. Because the plan is sure to draw strong opposition from= =20 politicians in Los Angeles and other areas served by public power agencies,= =20 Republicans have included a complex, $1.5-billion proposal to provide refun= ds=20 to those served by municipal utilities. ?????By blocking the emergency legislation, Republicans may stop state=20 Treasurer Phil Angelides from securing a $4.13-billion loan to repay state= =20 coffers for electricity purchases--a failure that would reduce the money=20 available to Davis for his next budget and possibly delay his plan to resol= ve=20 the energy crisis. Angelides needs the bill to guarantee repayment for the= =20 loan. ?????If Angelides does not obtain legislative approval by Monday, he will= =20 miss a Tuesday deadline lenders had given him to close the loan. That would= =20 clearly leave Davis with less money for new education, police and=20 road-building programs as he begins planning his next budget this month. ?????Moreover, failure to pass the bill could delay a record bond issue tha= t=20 Davis promised would replenish the budget and shield it from further energy= =20 drains by summer. And it could harm sagging confidence on Wall Street that= =20 California can deliver on its plans to manage the energy crisis, Angelides= =20 said. ?????California's credit rating has already been downgraded by one credit= =20 agency, Standard & Poor's, largely because of concerns about the effect of= =20 electricity purchases on state finances. ?????Negotiations Are Continuing ?????""The Republicans appear to be digging in and playing a dangerous game = of=20 financial roulette with the state.

Negotiations= =20 among legislative leaders continue. ?????To avoid widespread blackouts, the state government entered the=20 electricity-buying business in January after the private utilities became t= oo=20 burdened with debt to continue purchasing power on the expensive wholesale= =20 market. ?????Under a plan approved by the Legislature and signed into law by Davis,= =20 the state budget is to be repaid for the power purchases through a massive= =20 municipal bond issue, expected to be the largest in American history. The= =20 bonds, in turn, are to be paid off by utility ratepayers through a slice of= =20 their monthly bills. ?????However, the plan was based on the premise that the state would quickl= y=20 bring down power costs by entering into long-term contracts with suppliers-= -a=20 scenario that has yet to materialize. ?????In fact, California's power costs have gone up since January. Lawmaker= s=20 initially estimated that $10 billion in bonds would allow the budget to be= =20 repaid and cover future power purchases. Davis is now proposing $12.5 billi= on=20 in bonds--and higher electric bills--to finance the state's costs until 200= 3. ?????Republicans are convinced that it will not be enough. They say the=20 Angelides bridge loan is not needed because the state has money in various= =20 funds that could cover power purchases well into the fall. ?????They also confess to political considerations. Republican legislators= =20 believe that by allowing Angelides to obtain his loan now, they will be=20 powerless to oppose further borrowing later. The loan Angelides set up with= =20 J.P. Morgan Chase and several other financial services companies is to be= =20 repaid with the bond issue. If the loan is not repaid by the end of the=20 summer, the interest rate will rise dramatically, a situation that would ma= ke=20 it hard for the minority Republicans to oppose more bonds. ?????The strong GOP views were shaped in part by Democratic state Controlle= r=20 Kathleen Connell, who met with Republican legislators earlier this week and= =20 shared a highly critical appraisal of Davis' plan. ?????Connell told the Republicans that the governor's strategy was based on= a=20 series of assumptions about electricity market conditions in California thi= s=20 summer that, in her view, are highly improbable. ?????""It is almost impossible for all these hypothetical situations=20 envisioned in their scenario to occur at once,"" Connell said. ?????But even if all the assumptions came to pass, she predicted that=20 California would still need to secure another source of financing by next= =20 spring to continue energy purchases. Davis administration officials have=20 rebutted her claim. ?????""I am deeply troubled by this incremental approach to this financing= =20 that is long-term in nature and is going to burden the state for many years= ,""=20 Connell said, in what appeared to be a reference to Davis' reputation as a= =20 plodder.=20 ?????Using Surplus to Pay for Electricity ?????Republicans, who have traditionally been opposed to financing public= =20 programs with large bond issues, contend that Davis needs to reevaluate his= =20 plan. By proposing to essentially forget the $5 billion the state has spent= =20 so far on power, they are advocating using up the state's projected budget= =20 surplus on electricity costs, even if it means cutting new government=20 programs. ?????""If Gov. Davis continues down this path, he could bankrupt the state,""= =20 said Assemblyman Dennis Mountjoy (R-Monrovia). ""That would have a far great= er=20 impact on education."" ?????Democrats, who strongly believe that the surplus should be invested in= =20 roads, schools and to meet other long-term future needs, are unlikely to ev= er=20 support the idea. Lawmakers are already discussing outflanking the=20 Republicans by drafting a bill to repay the budget on a nonemergency basis,= =20 which would only require a majority vote. ?????That, however, would probably delay the financing until at least Augus= t,=20 since nonemergency measures do not take effect for 90 days--giving Californ= ia=20 only about six weeks to cut the largest municipal bond deal ever before sta= te=20 coffers begin to empty, according to Angelides. ?????There is another potential consequence: Many of the long-term contract= s=20 the Davis administration has reached to purchase electricity contain clause= s=20 that may make them void if the state does not obtain financing by July. ?????""This is a very dangerous game,"" Angelides said. ?????In other electricity developments Thursday: ?????* Over Republican objections, Democrats in the state Senate approved a= nd=20 sent to Davis a far-reaching bill that would put state government in the=20 business of operating its own power plants and selling electricity at cheap= er=20 rates than private companies.

PG&amp;E had asked the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles to overrule PUC decisions that the utility was not entitled to the money, which the utility spent buying electricity on the increasingly expensive wholesale market. In dismissing the lawsuit Wednesday, Judge Ronald S.W. Lew said ``PG&amp;E's claims are not yet ripe for review,'' meaning the case wasn't ready for trial. Steve Maviglio, spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, declared the decision a win for California ratepayers. ``PG&amp;E was banking on winning this case and using it as one of their excuses for not negotiating with the governor. It appears at least for now they failed,'' Maviglio said. But because the case was dismissed on procedural grounds rather than merit, PG&amp;E said the door was left open for the utility to refile its action once the commission makes final its interim orders on PG&amp;E's requested rate increase. ``The court determined that our lawsuit was premature because the CPUC had not yet finalized its various decisions on PG&amp;E's request for recovery of its costs to purchase wholesale power,'' PG&amp;E said in a statement. ``Today's action allows us to continue to pursue the merits of the case on a timely basis.'' A similar federal case filed by Southern California Edison is on hold, said company spokeswoman Clara Potes-Fellow. Edison, the state's second-largest utility, would drop that case as part of a rescue plan negotiated by Davis, which also includes the state buying the utility's transmission lines for $2.7 billion. Since last June, the two utilities say they have lost more than $14 billion. California's 1996 deregulation law froze electricity prices for customers of the state's three investor-owned utilities. When prices rose to record levels over the past year, PG&amp;E was unable to recoup the higher costs from its customers' bills. The undercollection, along with a failed deal to sell its transmission lines to the state, drove PG&amp;E to file for federal Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on April 6, the company argued. On Wednesday, the parent company, PG&amp;E Corp., reported a first-quarter loss of $951 million, or $2.62 per share. The first-quarter loss follows a fourth-quarter loss of $4.1 billion that also stemmed from continuing costs in California's power crisis. Bankruptcy Update/ PG&E Files Motion to Require CAISO to Follow Federal Law SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 3, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation - Pacific Gas and Electric Company has filed a motion in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court asking the court to direct the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) to comply with bankruptcy law, its Tariff, and a recent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) ruling, and stop billing the utility for wholesale power purchased. Pacific Gas and Electric Company's motion, which includes a request for a preliminary injunction, asks the court to enjoin the CAISO from requiring the utility to pay costs the CAISO has incurred and continues to incur to purchase wholesale power on its behalf, unless the utility can fully recover these costs. Bankruptcy law imposes an automatic stay to prevent parties from making certain claims or taking certain actions that would interfere with the estate or property of the estate of a Chapter 11 debtor. By purchasing power at costs higher than existing retail prices, and then sending the bill to the utility, the CAISO is violating the automatic stay provision and could be reducing the value of the company's assets by potentially hundreds of millions of dollars per month, depending on the average retail rate, the wholesale price, and the amount of power purchased by the CAISO. Recently, the CAISO sent Pacific Gas and Electric Company a bill for January and February spot market purchases that totaled nearly $1 billion. The action alleges that requiring the utility to pay more than it can collect in its existing generation-related rates would be improper under federal Bankruptcy Code because it is not in the best interest of the estate, would be an unauthorized post-petition use of Pacific Gas and Electric Company's property, and would force the utility to undertake credit on onerous terms. In addition, on April 6, 2001, FERC ordered the CAISO to comply with its February 14 order, in which FERC ordered that the CAISO could only buy power on behalf of creditworthy entities. Both Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Southern California Edison Company are no longer creditworthy companies. By continuing to purchase power on behalf of Pacific Gas and Electric Company, the CAISO is in violation of its own Tariff, FERC orders, and federal law.

SB 28x (Sher/Battin) makes various changes to the siting process including many IEP-sponsored proposals. As you will recall, two new provisions were added to the bill at the last minute before going to the Assembly Floor dealing with both retrofit schedules and environmental dispatch of generating facilities. Per the direction from IEP member companies, IEP has decided not to negotiate on the environmental dispatch issue. If the provision remained in the bill, IEP would continue to push the Republicans to hold their opposed position. We were, however, given the authority to negotiate on the retrofit issue as long as we were only talking about facilities that already have retrofit requirements. I will be faxing out the agreed upon language which in essence says the ARB shall set a schedule for the completion of any mandated retrofits. It does not expand the authority of the air districts and ARB to mandate retrofits under existing law. The schedule would require completion of the retrofits by July 1, 2004 or such later date as the ISO determines is necessary to maintain reliability. With these amendments, including some clean-up language, SB 28x will be voted-on on the Assembly floor on Monday and go to the Senate for concurrence on Tuesday. The final version will include the following IEP-sponsored proposals: ? Conforming the timing of offsets for power plants to Clean Air Act requirements ? Substituting CEQA-style hearings for the trial-like proceedings of the CE= C ? Streamlining the permit process for the modernization of existing power plant sites ? Giving consideration to the positive environmental impacts of a proposed project. ? Improving the timeliness and coordination of state and local agency review. ? Extending the current deadlines for the expedited review process established in AB 970. Since SB 28x is only a first step in making changes to the siting process, IEP member should now be thinking about what is next. IEP proposals still on the table include: ? Permitting local agencies to make zoning changes or other decisions for power plants contingent upon CEC CEQA Compliance ? Giving deference to other state and regional agencies ? Easing the threshold for override of local land use requirements. ? Making the ISO responsible for determining interconnection requirements -- Bad news on the =01&California First=018 issue quickly followed the good= news. The CEC staff analysis which said the State can't require builders of new power plants to sell electricity here, even as a trade-off for expedited permitting, was countered by another staff analysis that says the state can= . Both documents cannot be obtained due to attorney-client privilege. This issue is coming to a head next week with a decision pending by the CEC to include a California First clause on the approval of an expedited AES power plant project. AB 60x (Hertzberg), which ties to the siting process the requirement that a developer enter into a contract to sell power to specified California entities, is still poised to be heard in the Senate Energy committee. IEP members company lobbyist should continue to lobby against this measure regardless of the CEC=01,s decision on AES, although our arguments are definitely strengthened if the addition of the clause at the CEC is denied. -- IEP has finalized negotiations with Senator Burton=01,s office on amendm= ents attempting to solve our problem with the eminent domain provision in SB 6x (Burton), which is the State Power Authority measure. Attached is a copy o= f the bill in PDF form. The agreed upon language, which clarifies that the Authority=01,s purpose is to supplement existing generation activities, can= be found on pages 6-7 (Section 3310), 13 (Section 3341.1) and 16-17 (Section3352). Considering the inflammatory remarks made by Senator Burton in the press lately regarding seizing generation assets, this was most likely the best we could get. -- The first of Senator Dunn=01,s hearings with the Senate Select Committee= to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Market occurred this week. This week and next week=01,s topics will be to go over previous investigati= ons into market power. The committee heard or will be hearing testimony from: Frank Wolak, Chairman Market Surveillance Committee, CAISO; Eric Hildebrandt, Manager Market Monitoring, CAISO; and, Elaine Howle, State Auditor. -- The Assembly Electricity Oversight Subcommittee met this week and focused on the issue of natural gas collusion. Testifying before the committee were representatives from Dynegy and El Paso, commenting on the rise of natural gas prices and whether illegal market manipulation and collusion occurred. The subcommittee plans on putting together a package o= f bills related to natural gas issues, which would be the culmination of the committee=01,s hearings over the last two months. This package will be up = for consideration first by the whole special Assembly Energy committee. -- Governor Davis came out this week supporting the construction of the Calpine Metcalf Energy Center, the 600-megawatt power plant proposed for th= e San Jose region. The Governor urged the CEC to approve the plant siting so that construction can begin. -- Two long-term contracting bills are scheduled for hearings next week. IEP counsel is currently reviewing AB 57 (Wright) and SB 997 (Morrow) and will comment on their provisions as soon as possible. -- Attached is the most recent legislative tracking reports, both the special session and regular session.

On another issue that came up on the call this morning Ken, I was asking Justin about governing law specifically because I wanted to know if there was any law (India or English) requiring insurers to disclose information regarding risk to the insured, so we could cite some law perhaps to compel Beachcrofts to hand over the Liburdi report. For example, the Texas insurance code has evolved from a vague ""duty of good faith & fair dealing"" standard in some instances to specific laws preventing insurers from doing certain things detrimental to the insured. Justin tells me English law, in this regard, consists only of precedential case law, but it still could be helpful. Because of the commercial risk (outside the ambit of arbitration in the instance) it might be worthwhile to consider going into the London Commercial Court to seek some sort of extraordinary relief to prevent United India from withholding this information which is critical to running these machines. If, in fact, there truly is a 50% chance of failure in these machines, yet they won't share that evidence with us, this is a commercial risk DPC can't afford, regardless of coverage and apart from the arbitration. (I'm wearing my commercial hat instead of my legal hat today). Although Justin expressed concern about jurisdiction, United India did us the favor of bringing suit in London Commercial Court earlier, and thus having availed itself to the courts and having Peter Hirst's emphatic witness statement that makes a compelling case for the court to take jurisdiction, I think it is worth considering if they continue to refuse to give us the report in response to Justin's latest correspondence. I don't think we can afford to sit on our hands on this one. Why don't you and Neil kick this around, (since you don't have enough to do already). Cheers, Michelle Ken Blades 01/30/2001 08:42 PM To: Michelle cc: ""Williams, Justin"" @ ENRON Subject: RE: United India - strictly confidential and privileged I assume governing law is an issue that would be raised at the initial procedural hearing.

Yes that is a good idea to determine which law is more favorable to our position. Let's mention that to Ken tomorrow as we may want to have Atul Rajadhyaksha look at that for us. I think originally we discussed that notion but its been a long time ago.

The position on the insurance is that it does not specify a governing law. On an application of English private international law (ie conflict of laws rules) there is uncertainty whether it would be English or Indian law. At para 42 of Hirst's statement, he says that the contracts are impliedly subject to English law (based on London as the arbitration forum?). Certainly, my preference in terms of certainty would be English law. However, it is possible there could be an advantage to Indian substantive law and once we get UI's statement of claim, we should give thought to whether it would be worthwhile getting Indian law input on whether there could be advantage in arguing Indian law. I will ask Diane to add this to the ""to do"" list!

All California generators, even those not subject to FERC price regulation, will be required to sell into the ISO's real time market as a condition of their use of the ISO's interstate transmission lines. Hydroelectric facilities will be exempted. (24-7 for 1yr) Price Mitigation - The plan will establish a single market clearing price auction for the real time market. During Stage 1, 2 and 3 emergencies in the ISO's real time market, each generator (other than hydro) with a participating generator agreement is required to offer all available power and bid its marginal cost based on the generator's heat curve, emission rates, gas costs and emission costs, plus $2 for O&M. The gas cost will be the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in California; emissions are to be based on Cammon Fitzgerald(?). The gas cost and emissions will be published the day after, for use on the following day. A single market clearing price is determined in real time for all generators. Highest bid sets the clearing price. Each gas fired generator must file with FERC and the ISO, on a confidential basis, heat and emission rates for each generating unit. The ISO will use these rates to calculate a marginal cost for each generator, including maintenance and operating costs. In the event a generator submits a bid higher than the proxy price, the generator must, within 7 days of the end of each month, file a report with FERC and the ISO justifying its price. FERC has 60 days to review/act. No opportunity costs in real time. Marketers are in the same boat, as they must be prepared to justify bid at purchased cost based on specific purchases or portfolio with no opportunity cost. However, credit sleeves are permissible. Demand Response - Beginning June 1, only public utility load serving entities must submit demand side bids to curtail load and identify the load to be curtailed under those bids. FERC is attempting to break the demand curve. (24-7) Outages -- PGA generators will coordinate planned outages and report forced outages in accordance with the Commission Staff proposal adopted by FERC. Term - Order expires one year from date of issuance. RTO Filing - California ISO and two Utilities must make RTO filing by June 1 or Order lapses with no further effect. ISO Reporting - On September 14, 2001, ISO must file a status report on how things are working and how much generation has been built. Comments are due in 15 days. Quarterly reports thereafter. Revocation of Market Based Rate Authority and Refunds - The market based rate authority of all public utilities is conditioned on 1) no physical withhold of capacity, and 2) no inappropriate bidding behavior. Inappropriate bidding behavior includes bidding unrelated to known characteristics of the generation unit or without an input cost basis or bidding not based on unit behavior. An increased bid based on increased demand could apparently be inappropriate. In addition, ""hockey stick"" bids are expressly prohibited (i.e. bidding 95% at marginal cost and 5% at a much higher level). Limited 206 filing - Applies to sales in the WSCC, outside California. Refund conditions apply in real time spot markets when contingency within a control area falls below 7%. Control areas are not required to publish when this condition occurs. Apparently anything over marginal cost must be justified. All marketers and non-hydroelectric generators must offer to sell contractually and physically available capacity/energy to a location within WSCC. FERC is attempting to mirror the rules applied in California. Comments are due in 10 days on the 206 investigations. The refund effective date is 60 days from publication of the Order. Nox Limits in California -- Must sell requirements do not apply if a unit is prohibited from running by law. However, it appears that incurring fines does not overcome the must sell requirement- just include the fines as part of the price bid. Also if Nox is limited, may seek to show that generation would have been sold elsewhere or at different times for determining price. Surcharge to pay past amount due -- Comments are due in 30 days on 1) whether FERC should require the ISO to surcharge parties for payment into an escrow account to pay past costs and 2) the effect this surcharge would have on the PG&E bankruptcy filing. No mention was made at the meeting as to issue of exports of power from California. The Order is not finally drafted as of yet, and the status of the foregoing items could change upon issuance of the Final Order. We will keep you posted. RA",Company Business/Strategy

From our perspective, this is the best bill out there yet, though it still has serious problems---it isn't available electronically yet, but should be tomorrow, and I'll distribute then. The chances of the joint D-R bill being successful are slim, however, since it's up against the Speakers competing bill. There is talk that the Speaker will try to negotiate with Wright/Richman tonight and include any agreement in his bill (82XX). The original version of the Governor's MOU bill sits in the Senate. Most believe that Burton will put it up for a vote this week and it will fail. The Senate's version of the MOU (Sher-Peace-Kuehl) (78XX)came out today. It will likely be heard in the committee tomorrow or the next day. Notably, it kills Direct Access completely and makes Edison shareholders responsible for that portion of Edison's debt owed to suppliers. In short, a very bad bill. Burton's 18XX, which would de-link the bond issuance (to pay back the General Fund) from the DWR contracts is likely to pass the Senate tomorrow or the next day. Many--including Enron--support the bill (though we are supporting it behind the scenes). What people don't know: Whether there's the time or the will in the Assembly and Senate to achieve by Friday a single, comprehensive bill that can be sent to the governor for his signature. Whether the Legislature would postpone its month-long recess if the Legislature hasn't finished a bill by Friday (most folks think they will not postpone). Whether it's true that, irrespective of the energy issue, the Legislature will fail to get the budget completed by Friday and therefore have to postpone their recess anyway, in which case they might continue to work on the energy legislation at the same time. Odds-makers still say it's better than 50-50 that the Legislature does not get the Edison bills done by Friday and leaves on on its 30-day vacation.

Following discussions with the Prime Minister's office and a quick check with venues 31 October is firming up as the preferred date for a meeting with the Prime Minister and an office opening by the PM. Jeff Skilling Visit. The Nikkei and the Tokyo University have now made the decision to invite Mr Skilling to give the key note address at the symposium on 26 November in Tokyo. As mentioned, the symposium is the most prestigious conference on IT in Japan. While the conference itself receives significant media attention, the President of Nikkei has offered to interview Mr Skilling. This honour is usually reserved for Heads of State. The interview will be featured on the front page of the Nikkei and picked up by other major media services. kind regards Nicholas O'Day 08/29/2000 07:43 PM To: Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES, Rosalee Fleming/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: John Mark Schroeder/LON/ECT@ECT, Joseph P Hirl/AP/ENRON@ENRON, Mika Watanabe/AP/Enron, Takashi Kimura/AP/Enron Subject: Re: Ken Lay meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Ken Lay Visit. Balancing the need to push out the arrangement of high level meetings as far as possible with the desire to have a meeting with Prime Minister Mori prior to the US Presidential election, the week commencing 30 October would be the optimum time for a visit by Mr Lay. PM Mori is generally available in that week. We will get a preferred time from the PM's chief secretary first thing tomorrow morning Tokyo time. Jeff Skilling Visit. The boards of Nikkei and Tokyo University Institute of Advanced Studies have yet to make a decision on the key note speaker for the one day invitation only seminar to be held on 26 October. As mentioned, the boards will choose between the chairman of Cisco and Jeff Skilling. The conference is focused on the IT revolution and an invitation only event for approximately 600 of Japan's corporate leaders. The speaking panel and topics for discussion will be developed around the key note speaker. If Mr Skilling were to give the key note speech, it is likely that key senior Government Ministers would be asked to present at the seminar. Following the Prime Minister's commitment at the Okinawa summit of US$15billion expenditure in the region on IT infrastructure and education, Japan's focus on e-commerce is almost reaching fever pitch. There will be significant interest in the conference from senior levels of Government and the business community. Further, as you would expect with the involvement of the Nikkei, there is typically significant media coverage associated with the key note speaker's presentation. kind regards",Logistic Arrangements

TIM REITERMAN TIMES STAFF WRITER July 11 2001 SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge Tuesday reaffirmed his decision to bar a= =20 ratepayers committee from Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s bankruptcy case and= =20 denounced the committee's attorney for suggesting that the action could=20 prevent PG&E customers from receiving refunds for excessive energy charges. Judge Dennis Montali ruled against a U.S. trustee and the ratepayers=20 committee in deciding that ratepayers as a group had no claims and were not= =20 creditors when PG&E filed for bankruptcy on April 6. But Montali criticized ""misguided remarks"" by a committee attorney on July = 5=20 and news media accounts that followed the hearing. The judge said the repor= ts=20 left the misconception that by disallowing a ratepayers committee, he would= =20 reject all claims of ratepayers and they could lose out on future refunds. The judge and PG&E officials emphasized that there are no matters involving= =20 PG&E customer refunds before the state Public Utilities Commission. State officials are seeking about $9 billion in refunds, however, from the= =20 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for alleged overcharges to Californian= s=20 by energy companies since last year. The distribution of any ratepayer refunds would be decided by the PUC, and= =20 customers would be paid whether or not they filed Bankruptcy Court claims b= y=20 a Sept. 5 deadline, the judge and PG&E attorneys said. The judge took the highly unusual step of directing PG&E and U.S. Trustee= =20 Linda Ekstrom Stanley to consider remedies to allay any confusion among=20 PG&E's 5.5 million customers. He suggested publishing clarifications in newspapers that carried the=20 erroneous information, in PG&E customer bills and on Web sites.

But if you listened=20 carefully, he also indicated he'll give them more time to consider the case= .=20 Considering the iffy odds of winning in court, we suggest he keep goading t= he=20 federal commissioners -- while giving them all the time they need. Wednesday, July 11, 2001=20 Lights go out on Davis' power show=20 Three new developments show that some economic reality finally is being=20 applied to California's electricity crisis:=20 First, ""The nation's chief energy judge said Monday that California is owed= =20 maybe $1 billion in refunds from power generators, a fraction of the $8.9= =20 billion demanded by Gov. Gray Davis,"" reported the Register yesterday. Even= =20 that $1 billion amount might be balanced by the amount the state still owes= =20 the power producers.=20 To suggest workable and market-oriented solutions to the California=20 electricity crisis. Judge Curtis Wagner's recommendation will be taken up by the Federal Energy= =20 Regulatory Commission, which is being petitioned for the money by the state= =20 of California.=20 Because the judge's words will bolster FERC's apparent desire not to grant= =20 the ""refunds,"" the state probably will go to court, where the matter could = be=20 stuck for years. ""In the long term, this may indicate that competitive electricity has a=20 future even in California, but not thanks to the state,"" Robert Michaels, a= =20 professor of economics at Cal State Fullerton, told us. He's referring to t= he=20 state's botched 1996 ""deregulation"" effort, which has been made worse by Go= v.=20 Gray Davis and other officials since the crisis began a year ago. ""FERC since the 1980s favors competition, within the parameters of politica= l=20 reality,"" Mr. Michaels added. ""Now we're at square one: The industry doesn'= t=20 owe $9 billion to California."" As this process continues, he said, another= =20 positive aspect will be that a lot of facts will get aired. ""We'll see what= =20 has been happening in the markets"" in which power is bought and sold. Second, light already is shining on one area: This crisis was not ""Made in= =20 Texas'' by cronies of President Bush, as Gov. Davis and other Democrats hav= e=20 been contending.=20 In May, the governor attacked the president for ignoring ""the greed of thes= e=20 Texas energy companies,"" such as Reliant and Dynergy. In fact, according to information on state power contracts the governor=20 finally released Monday, Texas companies were way down on the list of=20 producers.=20 ""In roughly the first five months of the year, the state shelled out $1.2= =20 billion to Atlanta-based Mirant, the most any company was paid for=20 electricity, followed by $1 billion to Powerex, the marketing arm of BC Hyd= ro=20 in British Columbia [in Canada]. It also paid $331 million to the Los Angel= es=20 Department of Water and Power,"" reported the San Jose Mercury News. Only about 10 percent of our state's power during this period came from=20 companies with headquarters in Texas. Third, and finally, a new study by the Cato Institute shows what should be= =20 done next:=20 lAbolish retail rate caps, allowing prices to be set by the market.=20 This would be a better system than the present one, where the state buys th= e=20 electricity and passes much of the cost along through the state budget (pai= d=20 by taxpayers) and bonds paid for by long-term electricity price increases.= =20 Higher immediate prices would encourage conservation and production, leadin= g=20 in time to lower prices. lMove to real-time pricing so people shift activities such as washing to=20 off-peak hours.=20 lAbolish the Independent System Operator, which moves electrons around.=20 Give this function back to the utilities, who did it far better before=20 ""deregulation.""

What's worse, Lockyer has indicated tha= t=20 he believes that rape is an appropriate part of the system of punishments h= e=20 administers.=20 ?????Should it matter that Lay is a businessman? Imagine the outcry if the= =20 head of Enron were female. What would Lockyer's fellow Democrats have said = to=20 that?=20 ?????Should it matter that Lay is chairman of an electricity generator? Doe= s=20 the nature of his business justify threats to escort him to his own rape?= =20 Lockyer told the Los Angeles Times that he had singled out Enron's chairman= =20 because the Houston-based company is the world's largest energy trader.=20 ?????So apparently singling out a man for a heinous threat is OK because he= 's=20 the chairman of the world's largest energy trading company.

I am less certain about the direction FERC will go on pricing, since even the staff has recognized stumbling blocks in their own recommendation and offers possible variants. The ISO has not submitted revised tariff sheets for approval yet, so it is unlikely they would try to implement their own plan in the near term. If they try to do so without FERC approval, possible legal avenues might include the filing of a complaint at FERC, asking for fast track processing (this ""fast"" is measured in weeks, not days) and/or seeking injunctive relief in court (faster), which can be hard to obtain but not impossible, depending entirely on the circumstances.

About 130 members of the Bush campaign's 350-member high-tech council, including Dell Computer Corp. chairman Michael Dell, were scheduled to meet behind closed doors at Austin's Jewish Community Center.?. . ``I am excited about all of the opportunities that technology has given us to make a profound and positive impact on the world,'' said Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. ``America is a pioneer in the high-tech industry and it is vital for us to maintain this status,'' Bush said. '' Leading the world in innovation will not only improve the lives of Americans, but will also create many quality jobs.'' The purpose of the meeting was to allow the group to present Bush with their thoughts and share up-to-the minute information on the issues, said Bush campaign spokesman Tucker Eskew.

<28299872.1075858703582.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,RE: Next NERC Reliability Meeting on Legislation -- August 9th,"I don't know that NERC has ""given up"" on Enron. The timing of next week's meeting to ""resolve"" the legislation reflects the legislative realities that the committees of jurisdiction in Congress will take up the realibility legislation, along with other electricity issues, as early as the second week of September. In fact, congressional staff in the Senate and House are drafting legislative language on electricity issues during the August recess. They have pressed the ""coalition"" for a final work product. I gathered that at least some of what Jeff'spresentation to the NERC board would be about concerns matters beyond the legislation as such, but since they go to the NERC board's operation and independence, may go to our comfort level with NERC as the standards setting organization. Given the issues and concerns that have been addressed and communicated to NERC, and our preference for the PJM model (as Jeff told John Q. Anderson in the conference call), I think NERC got the information it wanted to get out of the call even though it didn't like the answers: i.e., whether Sarah and I have been faithfully representing Enron's position, whether Enron supports an ""SRO"" type organization; and whether there is anything they can do to get us on board. Perhaps we should have another conference call early next week so that Sarah and I have our guidance from everyone going into the August 9th meeting. For one thing, we need to determine if we are in any position to provide detailed comments on the ""shortened NERC"" version at the August 9th meeting or whether we do not wish to engage them on what specific changes it would take to get us on board. My sense is that since we have to deal with the players in the room on other issues, our overall position will be strengthened if we have some specific comments to make to explain our decision not to support NERC's version, even the shortened one. Don't get me wrong -- we have plenty of good reasons not to, I just wasn't sure how ""engaged"" we wanted to be in identifying changes that would bring us on board since I gather our opposition is more fundamental (no Western deference, budget concerns, independence issues, etc.).

Roll= ing blackouts hit southern Nevada.=20 Most California officials credit the FERC system, which is based on a varia= ble price cap, with reining in what had been a runaway wholesale power mark= et. But power generators have complained that the price caps, by limiting p= rofits, could discourage the production of critically needed electricity. A= nd as Monday's episode suggested, even the uncertainty about where the cap = will fall could lead to unexpected shortages.=20 ""That's the risk that you run (with price controls),"" said Arthur O'Donnell= , editor of the newsletter California Energy Markets. ""People want any kind= of certainty at all.""=20 Hidalgo said the state avoided blackouts only because of last-minute import= s from the Bonne=07ville Power Administration, the federal agency that mark= ets government-produced hydroelectric power in the Pacific Northwest. The s= tate went into a Stage 2 power alert, the next-to-last level before blackou= ts are ordered. The alert was canceled in late afternoon.=20 The blackouts would have been the first in California since May 8.=20 FERC imposed a round-the-clock ceiling on power throughout the West. The pr= ice fluctuates and is tied to the production costs of the least-efficient p= lant operating in California during a ""power alert"" declared by the Indepen= dent System Operator, which runs the state's power-transmission grid. When = there's no alert, prices can't exceed 85 percent of the cap that was establ= ished during the latest alert.=20 Until Monday, the maximum price held steady at about $101 a megawatt-hour i= n California. But when the ISO declared a Stage 1 power alert in early afte= rnoon, signifying that reserve supplies had dwindled to less than 7 percent= of demand, confusion set in, Hidalgo and others said.=20 Because of a steep drop in the price of natural gas, which fuels many Calif= ornia power plants, suppliers knew the cap would fall. But no one knew by h= ow much until the price was posted by the ISO.=20 The ceiling for California fell to about $77 at 3 p.m. but was back up to $= 98 in two hours, according to the ISO.

The state lost sales that would have provided enough electricity to su= pply more than 1 million homes, said Ray Hart, deputy director of the Calif= ornia Department of Water Resources, which has been buying much of the stat= e's electricity since January. At least five companies producing or marketing power ""are telling us t= hat since they don't know what they're going to get paid, they're not going= to take the risk, and so they're not going to sell the energy,"" Hart said. The electricity sales fell through after power consumption soared in s= ummer heat and grid operators were forced to declare a Stage 1 emergency, m= eaning reserves had dipped below 7%. It was the first such emergency since = May 31. Under a June 19 order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission inte= nded to bring down wholesale electricity markets across the West, a power e= mergency in California triggers the setting of a new price limit that appli= es to power plant owners from Washington to Arizona.=20 The new price is supposed to be based upon whatever it costs to run th= e most inefficient, expensive power plant selling electricity to California= grid operators during the first full hour of a Stage 1 emergency. But much uncertainty remains about exactly how and when the new price = is supposed to be established under the commission's order, and that appare= ntly drove away sellers, Hart said. Shortly after the state issued the Stage 1 alert at 1:30 p.m., putting= the old price limit of $90 per megawatt-hour in question, companies that h= ad committed to provide the state electricity hour by hour Monday afternoon= backed out, Hart said. The companies include TransAlta Energy Marketing of= Oregon, Constellation Power of Baltimore and Sempra Energy Trading, a unit= of the San Diego-based energy conglomerate. Forced to dip even deeper into the state's power reserves and declare = a Stage 2 emergency, water agency officials called the federal energy commi= ssion's hotline for clarification about what the new price should be and wh= en it should take effect. They got no answer. Hart said commission officials reached at home promised to try to clar= ify their order today. One outstanding question is what obligations power s= uppliers have to deliver electricity to California in an emergency. Both buyers and sellers in the market agree that the new price, when i= t is set, will probably be lower than $90 per megawatt-hour because the pri= ce of natural gas, the main fuel in California power plants, has dropped la= tely. Temperatures soared several degrees higher Monday than grid operators = had anticipated. But they said they expected to avoid rolling blackouts in = part because the Bonneville Power Administration in Portland, Ore., had agr= eed to provide several hundred megawatts of Pacific Northwest hydropower ea= ch hour in exchange for a return of electricity from California later this = summer.

Just about everyone has an opinion about how to solve California's energy problems. From building more power plants to capping prices to doing away with deregulation, federal regulators, consumer advocates, economists and energy companies all have weighed in with plans for ending the electricity shortages and financial distress that have troubled the state over the past year. Here is a look at what some say California should do now: LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD For many, the solution to California's energy woes is to increase the supply of power in the state by building more power plants. A greater supply from more sources would bring wholesale prices down. And two California economists, Severin Borenstein at the University of California's Energy Institute in Berkeley and Peter Navarro at the University of California at Irvine, argue that the impact would be particularly pronounced in areas where electricity generators now have monopoly or near-monopoly power. ""We need to build more power plants in close proximity to the ones where companies have market power,"" says Mr. Borenstein. The problem, the economists say, is that some areas of the state have only one power plant, so the energy suppliers can manipulate the price by reducing output at a certain plant when demand is high in order to boost prices. California does get some power from generators in the Northwest and Canada. But because demand is so great in the state and throughout the entire region and supply is limited, what is brought in doesn't make much of a dent. The economists add that because suppliers, including Williams Co., Duke Energy, Mirant Corp. and Enron Corp., have this freedom to charge whatever the market will bear, they can take unfair advantage of consumers. For instance, in Carlsbad, a community in San Diego, only one power plant owned by Duke Energy provides electricity to utilities in that area. The company has no competition, so it has the ability to set the price for its power, according to state Sen. Joseph Dunn, a Democrat from Santa Ana who has set up a Senate committee to investigate manipulation in the wholesale power market. ""If you need electricity and there's only one place to buy it, and everyone wants it, you're going to pay through the nose,"" says Frank Wolak, an economics professor at Stanford University and the director of a power-market monitoring committee, which monitors the wholesale electricity market to identify anticompetitive behavior. ""Is this fair? No. Something must be done about it."" Duke Energy spokesman Tom Williams says the company denies that it has ever done this and rejects allegations that it has manipulated the price of electricity. Spokespeople for the other companies also deny such allegations, saying prices have surged because demand has outstripped supply. Partly to prevent possible abuse of market power by suppliers, the Independent System Operator, which runs California's grid, contracted with energy companies to have them operate some power plants as ""reliability must-run"" units. In return for a fixed annual payment from the state, the companies agreed to make these plants available at a moment's notice to balance supply and demand. Electricity from the plants was priced based on the price of natural gas and other variable operating costs. In 1999, the ISO canceled two-thirds of the RMR contracts because the units were rarely called upon, due to a steady supply of power in the state, and the expense of the contracts to the state. When power prices surged in 2000, however, the ISO didn't use the remaining contracts to help keep supply in balance and power costs down. An ISO spokesman says the agency doesn't ""have a reason to explain why the RMR contracts weren't utilized."" He declined to comment further. CAP PRICES While many, including Gov. Davis, see more power plants as a long-term solution to the state's energy woes, they advocate capping the prices of energy sold on the spot market as an interim solution to keep the market stable while the plants are being constructed. ""In the short term, we need price caps,"" Gov. Davis has said to state legislators. ""That means that [power generators] get all their costs back and a 40% or 50% profit, which in this economy is pretty darn good."" Robert Glynn, chief executive officer of PG&E Corp. unit Pacific Gas & Electric, which sold some of its generating plants during deregulation, adds that price caps will ""keep wholesale prices low while new power plants are built."" For more than a year, the governor had urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to place a temporary cap on electricity sold in the spot market, saying the move would save the state's consumers billions of dollars on their energy bills while new power plants are being built. In May, after many months of rejecting the idea, the agency imposed an initial cap on prices in California during emergencies. In June, it extended the cap to other Western states and established that it would remain in effect at all times. Wholesale electricity prices at first fell in response to the caps, but surged again during a spate of hot weather in early July. FERC has been forced to make a number of adjustments to the cap as a result. These price caps, however, will expire in September 2002. Gov. Davis believes the caps need to stay in effect longer -- for three years -- to allow for the construction of new plants. RESTORE CREDIT-WORTHINESS Rebuilding a financial base for utilities is key to putting California's power market back on track. One way to do this, some experts say, is to let the utilities sell bonds to help them pay off debts and recoup the billions of dollars they've lost buying power at prices they couldn't afford. This would then allow the utilities to get investment-grade ratings. ""All California has to do is to ensure the utilities are credit-worthy again"" via the bond sale, says John Bryson, president and chief executive officer of Edison International, the Rosemead, Calif., parent of Southern California Edison Co. So far, the California Assembly and Senate have proposed that Southern California Edison sell $2.9 billion in revenue bonds, backed by a surcharge tacked onto the bills of the state's largest businesses, to pay off its commercial paper holders and alternative-power producers, such as wind and solar generators. The utility has a contract with the alternative-power producers, and the price it pays for power is fixed. But the utility has defaulted on those payments. The state believes that Edison International needs to help rescue its struggling utility. A $400 million tax rebate that Edison International is expected to receive from the federal government also could be applied to help the utility out of its financial crisis. ""The state needs to provide some stability to Edison so we can get back in the power business again,"" says Mr. Bryson. ""It's a pretty straightforward solution."" While utilities still continue to deliver electricity to consumers, the state has had to step in to buy the power on their behalf. Energy companies are currently refusing to sell power to the utilities, fearing they won't get paid because the utilities have defaulted on prior payments and have no credit. California's 1996 deregulation law uncapped wholesale power prices, but froze the rate the utilities could charge consumers. When wholesale prices surged in both the spot and day-ahead markets, running well above what the utilities could charge customers, the utilities couldn't do anything about it because the state deregulation law didn't allow them to sign long-term supply contracts. Restoring the utilities' credit-worthiness, however, may not be as quick as Mr. Bryson makes it sound given the huge sums that Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric owe the energy companies that sold them electricity. Pacific Gas & Electric filed for bankruptcy-court protection in April and is trying to write a reorganization plan in just six months, pay off all of its creditors in full and return to the power business, says the company's Mr. Glynn. CONSERVE ENERGY A massive conservation effort ""that busts the energy cartel,"" by reducing demand and, thus, lowering the price of wholesale power, is the only way to save the state in the short term, says Harvey Rosenfield, who heads the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, a consumer-advocacy group in Santa Monica, Calif. ""Only if demand falls so greatly that members of the energy cartel are forced to break ranks and lower prices will conservation solve the short-term problem."" Gov. Davis says Californians already are conserving at a record rate. For example, in July Californians boosted conservation efforts during the day by 11%, compared with the same time last year. Conservation efforts have been suggested from the use of halogen light bulbs to running washing machines in the evening to setting the thermostat at 78 degrees. REREGULATE Nettie Hoge, executive director of the Utility Reform Network, a consumer-advocacy group based in San Francisco, believes the state should return to the days when utilities monopolized the power market. Back then, she says, power supplies were abundant and prices preset. ""It was working just fine back then,"" Ms. Hoge says. ""It's not until we opened this state up to so-called competition that everything started to go in the toilet. Look at us now: We're like a Third World country. We can barely keep the lights on."" She says regulation would let consumers know what the price of electricity is and that price would stay the same regardless of fluctuations in supply and demand. California wouldn't ""be held hostage by out-of-state energy companies that not only control the price of electricity but also control the supply,"" Ms. Hoge says. But some experts say that under federal law, it might be impossible for states to reclaim authority over power plants that fall under the jurisdiction of the federal government. And it would cost billions of dollars to construct new government-owned generators or buy back with public funds old utility plants. LEAVE MARKETS ALONE Others believe that California's electricity markets should be left alone to evolve and become more competitive. The state should resist putting in constraints, like price caps, a number of Wall Street firms have advised the state. Merrill Lynch & Co., Credit Suisse First Boston and Goldman Sachs & Co. are among companies that helped the state and its utilities try to come up with financial solutions earlier this year to help ease the energy problem. None of the plans were implemented, however. ""The state needs to get out of power business,"" says Richard Cortwright, an energy analyst at Standard & Poor's Corp. The goal of any new plan should be to eliminate what's left of regulation, says Susan Abbott, an executive director at Moody's Investor Service Inc. ""State regulators restricted the utilities from signing forward contracts [locking in power supply at a fixed price], they capped retail rates and never encouraged retail choice,"" says Ms. Abbott. ""That's the antithesis of a competitive market. Until the state understands competition, this energy crisis will just continue to fester for years to come."" --- Mr. Leopold is chief of the Los Angeles bureau for Dow Jones Newswires. Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Energy (A Special Report) What Now? --- Looking to Washington: What can the feds do to make deregulation a less bumpy process? By Vasugi V. Ganeshananthan 09/17/2001 The Wall Street Journal R13 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) WASHINGTON -- Before California's energy problems began, support was building for congressional action on national electricity deregulation. But this year, says Sen. Frank H. Murkowski, a longtime proponent, ""support for deregulation is not there, in my opinion."" Still, even without a comprehensive package, the federal government could take some crucial partial steps toward more-open power markets. Some in Congress have backed measures that would lead to ""restructuring,"" as opposed to deregulation. That could involve such steps as settling more authority on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ensure reliability and access to the transmission grid. Another target for Congress will be the remaining antiquated laws and regulations designed for the days of monopolies, when each utility had its own borders. The aim is to fix troubled wholesale markets to set the stage for states to elect to deregulate at the retail level. ""I think it would be in the industry's best interest for this Congress to deal with some of the issues that have been hanging out there for some time,"" says Rick Shapiro, managing director of local and governmental affairs at Enron Corp., the Houston-based energy giant. In Congress so far this year, several bills have been introduced. The energy bill the House passed in early August offered some modest measures to foster competition, such as tax breaks to utilities joining regional transmission organizations, or RTOs, which FERC has asked energy companies to create to operate the power grid. Rep. Joe Barton, a Texas Republican and chairman of the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee, plans to introduce even more restructuring legislation this fall. His bill may address reliability, transmission and incentives for building power plants, among other issues. And Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, has plans for a bill of his own: His main point is to enhance FERC's authority to address power-market problems like reliability and fair access to the grid. But among other issues, he is making the latest of several pushes over the past few years to repeal the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, which was designed to prevent large national companies from dominating the industry. Though Congress in 1992 passed the Energy Policy Act permitting competition among wholesale electricity suppliers, the 1935 law still limits certain investments by utility holding companies. And many say it impedes competition. Sen. Bingaman also wants to repeal the parts of 1978's Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act that mandate the use of renewable energy, though he has said he still supports promoting renewable energy. Of course, there are longstanding, thorny issues that make federal action on energy markets a tough sell. While some Democrats, like Mr. Bingaman, are interested in the topic, the party in general is less in favor of deregulation than are Republican lawmakers. Thus, the recent Democratic takeover of the Senate is widely considered a setback. And while some regions strongly favor change, others don't. For instance, many Western states -- including Washington, whose Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell is a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee -- are feeling the ill effects of deregulation in California and are thus leery. Naysayers point to what they say was FERC inaction regarding inadequate power supplies and controversial pricing auctions. ""From California's perspective, FERC failed miserably by doing nothing for month after month after month,"" says Rep. Henry Waxman, a Democrat from California. ""I fear we might make the same mistake at the national level that California made at the state level."" But deregulation advocates think nationwide deregulation is inevitable. ""Would you like to be in an airport where there is one airline from here to Atlanta? Or an airport where there are three airlines, including a low-cost option?"" says Marc Yacker, director of government and public affairs for the Electricity Consumers Resource Council, a Washington, D.C., group of large industrial electricity users. If regulated states ""see that residents in Pennsylvania and Texas have a well-functioning electricity system . . . they will change."" Here are some of the main issues currently being hashed out in Washington: -- WHOLESALE MARKETS: Before any serious discussion of consumer deregulation can take place, Mr. Bingaman thinks wholesale markets need to be fixed. Among his main points: clarification of FERC and state jurisdiction. A recent white paper from him outlining his planned legislation calls for Congress to clarify that FERC is the ultimate authority over all transmission issues, with the power to overrule states. The paper adds, ""Legislation should affirm FERC's authority to order utilities to join regional transmission organizations."" Such powers, the thinking goes, would allow FERC to ensure that power transmission is fair and that access is free of any favoritism among affiliated utilities. And that would go a long way toward fixing wholesale markets and paving the way for retail deregulation should individual states choose to participate. ""To leave electricity legislation for another day would be to ensure that the problems faced now in the West will be replicated across the country,"" he wrote in the paper. -- FEDERAL AUTHORITY: The extent to which a federal entity should have authority over power markets is a contentious issue. Mr. Bingaman desires far-reaching powers for FERC. And power suppliers favor having federal regulators hold sway over transmission issues. Eugene Peters of the Electric Power Supply Association, a Washington, D.C., trade group for competitive power producers, says FERC ""has a role here in that they can essentially create a national template."" Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California has also said she will push to get more authority for FERC in order to ensure that all power prices are reasonable -- for instance, by assessing civil penalties to power suppliers who engage in unfair pricing. But some in the energy industry say FERC already has plenty of authority -- it's just that the commissioners haven't exercised it properly. Opponents of extending FERC's role fear a tangle of federal bureaucracy reaching a local level. ""I think that, if FERC exercises the authority that I believe that they have in many of these areas, legislation is not necessary,"" says Dave Penn, executive vice president of American Public Power Association, a trade group of public utilities based in Washington, D.C. FERC itself isn't arguing strenuously for more authority. Chairman Pat Wood says additional affirmations of authority would probably save the agency time in court later. And he says he wouldn't mind having the ability to assess penalties on utilities that fail to provide reliable service. But he adds, ""While I welcome any authority they want to give us, what we've got in the statute now is plenty good enough."" -- TRANSMISSION: Transmission is an industrywide beef; it's widely acknowledged that with electricity now being sold over greater distances, the current system is overtaxed, risking bottlenecks and reliability problems. So the nation needs more lines. But who decides where to put them? Plus, with the same people selling power and running transmission lines, there's a natural inclination for those controlling the transmission lines to want to sell their own electricity first. FERC has ordered the industry to institute RTOs to run the transmission system to ensure fair access to transmission lines, no matter who owns them. Sen. Bingaman's proposals would affirm that power for FERC. And Mr. Wood says the RTOs can also handle siting of new transmission lines. But many states are unhappy with FERC's strategies. Some, fearing federal interference with the states' authority over siting, are taking steps to form their own multistate councils that would ensure regional cooperation while leaving control in state hands. And Maryland, the District of Columbia and Virginia are requesting a rehearing of a FERC order that they join RTOs, saying that federal regulators are moving with undue haste even in areas where transmission isn't a problem. -- INTERCONNECTION: In a competitive system, the growing number of new electricity generators must be able to connect to the power grid. But the interconnection of new generators with the old utilities that own the grid's transmission lines can raise two kinds of problems. On the technical side, newer generators can have different types of systems with different generating capacities, raising concerns of overloads and other problems. On the competitive side, utilities can make it difficult for new generators to connect to the grid. So, many in the industry are calling for uniform technical standards to allow equal access to the grid -- once a generator meets the standards, a utility would have no basis to deny a hookup -- and to ensure that interconnection doesn't risk the safety and reliability of the system. ""As we've moved into deregulation, there are more entities that want to connect to the system,"" says Ken Rose, a senior economist at the National Regulatory Research Institute at Ohio State University. There must be some means, he says, to ensure that access for all these new players remains fair. FERC's Mr. Wood says interconnection is ""a top priority"" for the agency. He has officially asked utilities to file their interconnection rules, and FERC will issue a policy on interconnection this fall. Chris Mele, legislative director of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners in Washington, D.C., says that interconnection rules need to be flexible. ""NARUC supports Congress requiring the establishment of national interconnection and power-quality standards that would be developed and adapted by an appropriate technical-standards organization,"" says Mr. Mele. ""However, the states need to have the flexibility to adapt these rules or to adapt their own rules."" --- Ms. Ganeshananthan is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal's Washington bureau.

Energy (A Special Report) What Happened? --- Lessons From Across the Seas: Deregulation is working pretty well in Britain; But it has taken a long time By Geoffrey T. Smith 09/17/2001 The Wall Street Journal R9 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) LONDON -- For all those who just can't understand why electricity deregulation is worth bothering with: Look abroad. It has to be admitted that Europe's deregulation experience looks better than the U.S.'s largely because of the relative starting positions. Europe is the 300-pound couch potato who feels more of a difference after a month in the gym than the guy who is already quite fit. For decades, the European electricity industry was run by engineers patronized by politicians. The result: a hugely overbuilt system with rows of underused power plants and legions of unnecessary staff, paid for by sky-high, regulated rates. Deregulation is starting to put an end to all that. Electricity prices have fallen in most European markets, especially in Germany, since a European Union deregulation directive took effect in 1999. And in the United Kingdom, deregulation has gone further than in most of Europe. Electricity prices are down by around a third for families and businesses, and there are few problems with supply. But there is a catch -- an important one for an American public already weary of the pain of deregulation: In Britain, it has taken more than a decade to make deregulation start to work. Britain started out with a few advantages that places such as California don't have. Its policy is in the hands of a single, central government committed to deregulation, while U.S. state and federal regulators often disagree on what needs to be done. It started out owning the whole energy business and could carve it up as it pleased. As it deregulated, it didn't have to face the problem of exploding demand due to Silicon Valley and rapid population growth. And Britain, unlike California, started from a position of significant oversupply, and for years was liberal in allowing still more plants to be built because they would be fueled by cheaper and cleaner North Sea natural gas instead of coal. Despite all this, British electricity deregulation has had its share of false starts. For 10 years up until 1998, the whole process seemed to be bringing little in the way of concrete gains. For much of the decade, the government was a timid pioneer, relying on the blunt policy instrument of price controls to bring prices down when its fancy new market models didn't work. But Britain was also willing to try different approaches if its first choice failed -- perhaps a lesson for the U.S. Like California, Britain set up a wholesale pool for day-to-day power purchases; Britain scrapped the pool when it failed to bring prices down. Britain also allowed power buyers and sellers the crucial freedom to lock in their prices for months ahead, insulating them from the price zigzags that have crippled California's two largest investor-owned utilities and sent the biggest, PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric Co. unit, into Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. ""The U.K. has got the balance about right, but competition has been a long time in coming,"" says Richard Lewis, U.K. managing director of Enron Corp., Houston. The seeds were sown in 1988, when then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher decided to extend her free-market ideology to the electricity sector. The British government had a clear idea what it wanted to do. New laws were passed. Deregulation began. By contrast, Germany's federal government, which started the process at the end of 1998, has had to negotiate electricity deregulation with two other tiers of government and more than 800 electricity companies. Britain split the electricity sector into three parts: power generators, completely separate regional suppliers and National Grid PLC, to which it gave ownership and control of the country's high-voltage power lines. By separating the grid from the companies that actually sell and produce electricity, this structure ensured that no seller could keep others out of the market. The government sold majority stakes in all 12 English and Welsh regional electricity suppliers to the public in December 1990. Six months later, it had sold 60% each of National Power PLC and Powergen PLC, giving to those two companies almost all the coal-fired power plants in England and Wales. The sale of nuclear generator British Energy PLC followed in 1996. Managers across the sector started cutting cut costs agressively, especially for labor. With privatization, the design of new plants was increasingly influenced by economic factors, such as natural gas's cost advantage over coal, rather than political ones. Back in 1988, Britain's old Central Electricity Generating Board had wanted to build expensive new coal plants and nuclear reactors despite the presence of vast untapped natural-gas reserves right on the U.K.'s doorstep in the North Sea. But, thanks to privatization, almost all the new power plants built in the next 10 years were gas-fired. In fact, so many were built that the government slapped a moratorium on new plants in order to cushion, if not stop, the decline of the domestic coal industry. The moratorium was lifted last November. In the early 1990s, a model evolved in which the companies that distributed power to homes and businesses -- known as regional suppliers -- were allowed to charge a specified amount for getting the power to the customer; if a company could find a way to do it for less, it got to pocket most of the difference. Customers got lower bills, and the companies' shareholders were happy -- a little too happy, in fact, as the public started to resent the ""fat cat"" bosses who were seen as skimming off fat profits for little improvement in service. Deregulation really got going in 1994, when the government allowed industry to shop around for its power. A year later it gave up its rights to veto foreign takeovers of suppliers, starting a wave of U.S.-led takeovers. But within a few years most of the U.S. firms had either sold or said they intended to, although Dallas's TXU Corp. stayed and thrived. For much of the 1990s, it wasn't market forces that brought British electricity prices down. ""Almost all of the cuts in prices to consumers came from [our] price controls on monopolies,"" says Steve Smith, head of trading arrangements at the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets, the regulator that has implemented government policy under one name or another since 1990. Most of a household's bill comes from the cost of running the distribution network, not from producing the power. It was this distribution part of the business that bore the brunt of the price controls. The failure to bring down the price of power itself threatened to provoke a crisis in 1998, when the government finally extended competition to the household and small-business sectors. Nine years after the Electricity Act got the ball rolling, the market for customers was 100% open. But something still had to be done about the power generators' prices, which weren't falling as expected. In theory, British power generators had had to bid into a wholesale pool each day since 1990, telling the National Grid at what price each plant could supply power. The Grid would then buy as much power as needed from each plant, starting with the cheapest. But the pool didn't work. There were too few players in it. The generators' prices to resellers -- the regional suppliers -- stayed stubbornly flat. Accusations of market manipulation abounded, but could rarely be made to stick. The answer was NETA -- the New Electricity Trading Arrangements, which were the centerpiece of last year's Utilities Act. Under the new rules, which took effect March 27, electricity has become as close as it is ever likely to be to being a market like any other. Producers, consumers and intermediaries now all trade electricity directly with each other, up to 3 1/2 hours before they have to deliver or use it -- rather than buying power through an intermediary pool that buys from the generators. The grid operator still manages the physical flow of electricity, but intrudes only inasmuch as buyers and sellers have to notify it how much they intend to put into or take out of the grid at each half-hour of the day. NETA has galvanized competition. Prices for electricity have fallen 15% since March, according to British regulator Ofgem, and they continue to fall. But it's not a question of forcing prices down -- more of allowing the market to set the price of power. More than 7.8 million customers have switched suppliers since 1998. And the Electricity Association, a trade group for companies in the electricity business, reckons that households can cut almost GBP 30 ($43), or about 12%, off their annual bills by switching. At last, deregulation is working. ""NETA has definitely been the right framework to foster competition,"" says Brian Count, the new chief executive of Innogy PLC, a power generator and supplier that is one of two companies created last year by the breakup of the generation company National Power. But even as the free-marketers lean back and congratulate themselves on a job well done, storm clouds gather on the horizon. The Labour government, re-elected in June, has ordered the U.K.'s first national energy policy review in 20 years. The government is signaling that it wants more control over future investment decisions. The nuclear industry and renewable sources such as wind power look likely to benefit as the British government tries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. As Britain's own natural-gas reserves run out in the middle of this decade, it will become like the rest of Europe -- uneasily dependent on countries such as Algeria and Russia for supplies. Hence the support for nuclear power. The industry accepts all this, but Innogy's Mr. Count speaks for many when he says: ""For goodness' sake, don't let us now get dragged back to central planning and regulation."" --- Mr. Smith is an assistant news editor for Dow Jones Newswires in London.

Energy (A Special Report) What Now? --- On Second Thought: In the wake of California's power problems, many states are taking a wait-and-see approach to deregulation By Eileen O'Grady 09/17/2001 The Wall Street Journal R13 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) California's energy crisis has a lot of people wondering whether it's really such a good idea to let consumers shop for electricity. No one wants to repeat California's mistakes. So, while 12 states and the District of Columbia already offer residential and commercial energy consumers a choice of providers, and a handful are pressing ahead with plans to fully deregulate next year, some 20 others are either delaying deregulation plans or taking a hard look at whether they ought to move toward competition. And no state has started a new deregulation effort since California's blackouts and price spikes were first reported. But while the fervor for deregulation definitely has cooled, not all of the blame can be laid at California's doorstep. Indeed, in virtually all of the states that deregulated before California's troubles began -- particularly in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and New Jersey -- consumers have seen for themselves that many of the new entries in the power market haven't delivered on one of the new system's key promises: lower prices. Texas, Michigan and Virginia are expected to stick to their plans to open their electricity markets fully next year. But industry sources agree that a lot more states would be about to do the same if California's electricity troubles hadn't given them second thoughts. ""The advance of retail competition has definitely stalled,"" says Ken Rose, a senior economist at the National Regulatory Research Institute, at Ohio State University in Columbus, a research arm of a national trade group for state utility regulators. ""The question is whether it reverses,"" Mr. Rose adds. ""You would expect bumps in the road, maybe a slow start, but for the past year and a half it's not been going in the right direction."" While no state has repealed an electricity-deregulation law in the wake of California's troubles, seven states have altered their deregulation laws, mostly to delay the start of consumer choice by a few months or a few years -- until state regulators and legislators can see how deregulation plays out elsewhere. Oklahoma, one of those states, pushed its shopping start date back to 2004 or later, from July 1, 2002, worried that deregulation might jeopardize its below-average electric rates. ""California has slowed down the restructuring effort, but hasn't stopped it,"" says Oklahoma state Sen. Kevin Easley, a Democrat and an early supporter of deregulation. ""Long term, we think it's still a positive thing for Oklahoma."" As a major producer of natural gas, Oklahoma has attracted a large number of new power plants that run on natural gas. Deregulation, its local supporters say, thus could help the state create new jobs by encouraging more local power plants that export electricity, adding value to the state's natural resources. Nevada, where electricity demand is growing dramatically, used an emergency measure in April to delay the start of consumer choice for a third time. The measure also froze electricity rates until early next year and placed a moratorium on utility sales of power-generating plants. That effectively undid a customer-choice law passed in 1997, although the state will allow some large customers to shop for power next year. Wisconsin has no deregulation law, but its utilities were beginning to propose ways to divide their power-generation assets in order to create a competitive market. When California's problems emerged, however, Wisconsin Public Service Corp., a unit of WPS Resources Corp., Green Bay, withdrew a proposal that would have urged state regulators to allow the company to transfer some of its power plants to a separate company -- a first step toward deregulation. ""Wisconsin has been set back by California,"" says Larry Weyers, chairman of Wisconsin Public Service. ""Any talk of deregulation is met with a lot of opposition, and anything seen as changing the system is dead on arrival. Our plan could have been successful, but attitudes became cautious."" So much for the states that got cold feet. How are the pioneers faring? Not very well. Most electricity customers in fully deregulated states have seen few competitive options. Figures from regulators indicate that after an initial burst of consumer interest, new energy providers in New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania have seen significant reductions in numbers of customers. When New Jersey started letting consumers shop in 1999, about 2.2% of residential consumers switched to a new provider. Now, only 1.1% are still buying electricity from a company other than their incumbent utility. Even Pennsylvania, which was seen as the biggest deregulation success, ""is beginning to look more ordinary,"" says Mr. Rose, the regulatory economist. Some electricity retailers that pulled out of the state blamed a climate of fear arising from California's troubles. But rising wholesale power prices have taken their toll as well, says state consumer advocate Irwin Popowsky. In 1998, Pennsylvania residential customers had a choice of at least 30 alternative power providers. Today there are fewer than 10. The reason: The new entries proved unable to compete with the lower, capped rates offered by the incumbent utilities, industry sources say. Initially, Pennsylvania's biggest utility, Peco Energy Co., a unit of Chicago-based Exelon Corp., lost 44% of its industrial customers and 30% of its commercial clients to new suppliers, according to data published by the state consumer advocate's office in July 2000. One year later, however, many of those customers had returned to Peco, leaving the utility with a loss of only 4.7% of its industrial customers and 5% of its commercial clients. For residential power customers, the story's the same: Around the state, initially about 10% selected a new supplier before California's problems erupted. Today six of the state's seven original power companies have regained residential customers as competing suppliers leave the market and savings offered by those remaining shrink, Mr. Popowsky says. The number of residential customers being served by new suppliers dropped to 574,661 as of late June 2001, down 18% from March. ""It's a price issue,"" says Sharon Reishus, associate director at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Cambridge, Mass. Though wholesale power prices have fallen since the first part of the year, they remain unpredictable, she says. A competing provider might be able to make profits, say, 10 months of the year, but could still ""get killed in the spot market"" if prices spike, Ms. Reishus says. One of the biggest new competitors in Pennsylvania is New Power Co., a subsidiary of NewPower Holdings Inc., Purchase, N.Y. New Power bid for and won 250,000 Peco Energy customers around the time of Peco's 1999 merger with Unicom Corp. to become Exelon. But New Power's plans extend well beyond the borders of Pennsylvania. It has plans to sell natural gas and electricity to residential consumers and businesses around the U.S. ""We have seen some volatility in the Pennsylvania market due to the rise in wholesale prices,"" says H. Eugene Lockhart, president and chief executive officer of New Power. But, he adds, ""we remain committed to serving our customers there and hope to step up our marketing efforts in the near future."" But Houston-based Shell Energy Services, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group's Shell Oil Co., cited the slowing pace of retail access around the country for its recent decision to drop out of the hunt for new electric customers in Texas and Ohio -- even before markets in those states are fully open. Shell Energy Services had already signed up 40,000 residential customers in Texas and 30,000 in Ohio, but officials said that, given the slow progress of deregulation, it was unlikely the company would reach the size needed to be profitable in a reasonable length of time. The prospects for selling power to residential customers remain difficult, but the opportunity for marketing to business is brighter. Small businesses are seen as key for electricity suppliers seeking new customers, says Scott Gahn, managing director of commodity management at Enron Corp.'s Enron Energy Services unit, which markets power to business. ""Each month that goes by, we're adding gas and power customers in Maine, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Ohio and Texas,"" Mr. Gahn says. He even goes so far as to say that California's impact on deregulation hasn't been all bad. For energy markets in many states, he says, the California crisis ""has gotten the issue [of being able to choose your own provider] onto their radar screen in a way that you'd have to pay an advertising agency to do."" State officials in Texas, Michigan and Virginia, where consumers will start shopping next year, vow not to repeat California's mistakes. ""Everyone asks me, will we have California's problems?"" says Tom Noel, chief executive of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which runs the state's power grid. ""No, we won't have their problems, but we will have some of our own."" The Texas electricity market is very different from that of California. Texas has a copious supply of electricity, thanks to extensive construction of power plants powered by natural gas, which also is in plentiful supply locally. One reason California got into trouble: Its utilities had to import a lot of electricity and high-priced natural gas to meet the state's growing demand for power. Texas has attracted about two dozen companies to compete for consumers' business through a 1999 deregulation law that carved existing utilities into separate generating, transmission and retail units. It has been running a customer-choice pilot program ahead of its Jan. 1, 2002, debut of full deregulation. ""We're in this for the long haul,"" says New Power's Mr. Lockhart. ""With the opening of the market in Texas, there will be a national example of getting it right -- saving consumers money and giving them choices to help manage their energy use."" --- Ms. O'Grady is a reporter for Dow Jones Newswires in Houston.

Business/Financial Desk; Section C German Deal for U.S. Water Utility By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 09/17/2001 The New York Times Page 6, Column 3 c. 2001 New York Times Company In the first deal in the United States since the terrorist attacks of last week, American Water Works of Voorhees, N.J., has agreed to be sold to RWE, a German utility, for more than $5 billion, executives close to the transaction said yesterday. The deal, which is expected to be announced today before the markets open, will be a crucial test of investor confidence in mergers and acquisitions in the wake of the calamity. One executive said the transaction was being announced now partly as an effort to demonstrate the resolve of businesses worldwide. ''We discussed holding off for obvious reasons,'' the executive said. ''But we decided that we should press ahead. The markets need to know that business will continue as usual. And by that, I mean business -- the commerce of life -- will not stop in the face of terrorism.'' For RWE, the deal represents its latest effort to expand through acquisitions. Last year, RWE acquired Thames Water of Britain and the E'town Corporation of New Jersey. American Water Works, the largest publicly traded water utility in the nation, with annual revenue of $1.4 billion, has been acquisitive itself. It recently announced an agreement to buy the Azurix North America Corporation, the water utility of the Enron Corporation, and is about to complete a deal to buy the water assets of the Citizens Communications Company of Stamford, Conn. Spokesmen for American Water Works and RWE could not be reached for comment last night. Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Germany's RWE Agrees to Buy American Water Works for $4.6 Billion Plus Debt 09/17/2001 Dow Jones Business News (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) ESSEN, Germany -- German utility RWE AG said it has agreed to buy American Water Works Co., the largest publicly traded water utility in the U.S., for $4.6 billion, plus $3 billion in debt, in attempt to expand internationally. RWE said it would offer $46 per outstanding share of American Water Works, a 37% premium to American Water Works' share price in the past 30 days. The offer values American Water Works (AWK) at a total $7.6 billion, as RWE will offer $4.6 billion for the shares and assume $3 billion in debt, it said. Discussions between RWE and American Water had broken down late last month. When the transaction is complete, RWE plans to bundle American Water Works, which has a market capitalization of $3.3 billion, with its Thames Water operations in the U.K., RWE said. RWE is looking to expand internationally to close the gap with competing global utility firms Vivendi SA and Suez SA, both larger in size by market capitalization. Last year, RWE bought Thames Water PLC of Britain and also acquired E'town Corp. of New Jersey. American Water Works, Voorhees, N.J., is an aggressive buyer in its own right. It recently announced the purchase of Azurix North America Corp., the North American water-services division of Houston's Enron Corp. for $141.5 million, including $8.3 million of debt and tax savings of $13 million, for an enterprise value of $136.8 million. It scrapped a planned acquisition of water utility SJW Corp., San Jose, California, earlier this year after repeated regulatory delays. And it is expected to complete soon a nearly two-year-old deal to buy the water and waste-water assets of Citizens Communications Co., Stamford, Connecticut. RWE said shareholders representing 24% of American Water shares have already entered binding agreements to support the transaction. ""In addition to providing us with a top position in the U.S., the acquisition of American Water will further establish RWE as a global leader in the position of water services,"" RWE Chief Executive Dietmar Kuhnt said in a statement. ""The development of RWE's world-class water business in turn will provide greater balance to our core utility portfolio and allow us to deliver enhanced growth and shareholder value,"" he added. The deal is expected to be completed within 18 months to two years. The transaction will require shareholder and cartel authority approval. RWE's supervisory board and the board of American Water Works have approved the offer. Copyright (c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

BOMBAY, Sept 17 (Reuters) - U.S. energy firm Enron Corp's Dabhol Power Co said on Monday it has sought urgent funding from its foreign lenders to repay interest on past loans and preserve a $2.9 billion power plant that is lying idle. Dabhol, which is 65 percent owned by Houston-based Enron, said monthly interest payments to its lenders have to be made in September but it does not have enough cash. It has about 25 foreign lenders, which include ABN AMRO, Citibank, US Exim and Bank of America. ""The company has funds in its account to make certain payments and anticipates that some of those will be made. It has requested disbursement from banks towards the rest,"" the spokesman told Reuters. He did not disclose details of the interest payments nor the cash it wants. The project has been funded 70 percent by debt. Dabhol has not been earning any income after its sole customer, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), in May stopped buying any more power from its plant citing high tariffs. MSEB was buying the entire output from the plant's first phase of 740 MW and had committed to buy the second phase output of 1,444 MW when it was ready. Following the cancellation, foreign and local lenders stopped disbursals of around $400 million forcing complete stoppage of work on the second phase. They have also declined to provide funds to preserve expensive equipment from being damaged by natural elements. ""Without funds for preserving the facility, the physical assets will begin to deteriorate almost immediately, which in turn will further add to the overall cost of completion,"" the spokesman added. Dabhol now wants at least a portion of this $400 million amount disbursed to help it meet its interest payments and take care of the plant. The development is likely to put further pressure on India's federal government to solve the contentious dispute which has affected the country's efforts to attract foreign investment in the power sector. Three foreign power companies have already pulled out, including French giant Electricite de France . Analysts believe that a quick solution to the problem is key to restoring investor confidence. UGLY SPAT Once considered the showpiece of India's liberalisation programme, the Dabhol project is now being dubbed an example of political and bureaucratic bungling. Enron has announced its decision to sell its equity in the project to the federal government or any other company. It says MSEB is yet to pay bills worth $185 million. On Monday, Dabhol further upped the ante by slapping MSEB with two preliminary notices of termination. One is for not paying bills for the months of June and July and the other for MSEB's decision in May to cancel the power purchase agreement, the contract that governs the state board's purchase of power from Dabhol. This is the third such notice from Dabhol. In May, it served the first notice for non-payment of bills for December and January. The two fresh notices are a body blow for MSEB, analysts said as it means the state utility could end up fighting three separate arbitration battles. According to the power purchase agreement, all disputes will have to be settled by the International Court of Arbitration in London. As per this agreement, serving preliminary notice is followed by a six-month cooling off period. If the dispute is not settled by then, Dabhol can issue a final notice and the dispute automatically goes for arbitration. The six-month period for the first notice, which was issued in May, ends in November. If there is no settlement by then, MSEB will have to answer Dabhol's charges of non-payment of bills for December and January. The same procedure will be followed in the case of the other two notices. But efforts to solve the issue so far through arbitration have been delayed by domestic litigation. MSEB wants the dispute to be heard by local courts, while Dabhol is pressing for arbitration in London. The Bombay high court, which began hearing this dispute on Monday, is expected to give a final verdict soon. ($1=48.83 Indian rupees). Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. UK: INTERVIEW-Screen trading enhances metals market. By Martin Hayes 09/17/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. LONDON, Sept 17 (Reuters) - The emergence of electronic screen systems alongside existing open-outcry and telephone markets has enhanced trading in base metals, Paul Shuman, LME desk manager at Cargill Investor Services (CIS), said. ""From our perspective, because we are brokers and do not run a proprietary position, we are bound, and always will be, to try and get the best price for our customers. The more platforms there are for us to trade on, the better for our customers,"" Shuman told Reuters. The London Metal Exchange (LME), the world's leading non-ferrous metals market, introduced an automated trading system (ATS) known as Select in February, and unveiled a more sophisticated phase last week. The LME's system joined rival platforms managed by Spectron Metals and Enron Online, part of Enron Corp. These systems have improved market liquidity and increased price transparency throughout the day, Shuman said. ""Instead of being restricted to the ring and the telephone market, where you have to ring around, you have instant access to bids and offers all through the day."" ""Now when we give our customers a market we can do that on the basis of the best bid and offer on the screen. From our company's perspective it has been very helpful,"" he said. Spreads between bids and offers have narrowed and access to the market has become faster. ""It is certainly a tighter market, a quicker market, and probably a more liquid market, he said. SCREENS NOT PARAMOUNT However, the LME's ATS is not designed to replace open-outcry on the 124-year-old exchange. Rather, it will complement the current mix of inter-office phone trading and open-outcry. ""Screens do not replace the ability to talk to one another,"" he said. There are instances when customers needs to transact a highly complex, multi-legged carry or spread trade, and it is unlikely that any system will be able to replicate that. ""You phone up another broker and say what you want to do. You either have to do it face-to-face or on the phone - you cannot do it on the screen - speed is important."" He said there may well be a fall-off in volume at one or other of the current platforms, but the screens and the telephone market are likely to run in tandem, while the LME plans to continue open-outcry ring trading as well. ""For the customers, they are going to get the best of all worlds,"" he added. LME SCREENS GAINING ACCEPTANCE On the screens the dust has still to settle between the rivals, but there are signs that LME Select is being used more by the market. ""In the last few weeks, Select has done better as more people have become used to it, and it (Select) is free, whereas some others are not,"" Shuman said. And now the Select system is much more capable after the release of the second, more sophisticated phase. ""It is very ambitious and it will be interesting to see how it works,"" he said. The second release incorporates a unique request-for-quote function. This allows traders to direct enquiries, such as market size and depth, to as many or as few respondents as required, and whether or not to be anonymous. It also covers all the LME's contracts - the initial release was confined to the basic cash, three months and cash-to-threes spread contracts. ""It is going to take a while for Select Two to become the tool for the industry. But Cargill is in favour of anything that allows us to give a better service to our customers,"" Shuman said.

French Electricity Bourse To Run Tests Before Launch 09/17/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) PARIS -(Dow Jones)- French electricity bourse, Powernext SA took one step closer to its imminent launch with the announcement Monday that it will host a series of simulations from Sept. 25. Powernext will stage three sets of simulations, the first from Sept. 25 to Sept. 27, the second on Oct. 2-4, and the third on Oct. 9-11, Powernext said in a press statement. Close to 20 companies will participate in the tests, including electricity suppliers, traders, the exchange's investors, industrial consumers and traders. TXU Europe Energy Trading and Enron will be among the participants. The exchange is also holding seminars this week for participants to get acquainted with the ElWeb electronic trading system, also currently used by Nord Pool in the Nordic region, the market model, and Clearnet, the exchange's financial guarantor. Jean-Francois Conil-Lacoste, Powernext's director-general, said the exchange is still on track for its official launch later this autumn, although a date hasn't been set yet. Euronext Paris SA and HGRT, a financial holding for European electricity grid operators, hold 34% and 17% of Powernext, respectively. Currently, Electricite de France (F.EDF) is the sole shareholder in HGRT, although the long-range plan envisions Dutch grid operator, TenneT and Belgian counterpart, Elia as potential investors. Powernext aims to expand its activities in the Benelux region, dovetailing newly created Euronext, formed through a merger of the Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam stock exchanges. Powernext will also announce later this autumn the addition of new investors. Currently, the remaining 49% is divvied up among French banks BNP Paribas (F.BNP), and Societe Generale (F.SGF), plus state-owned EDF, oil giant TotalFinaElf (TOT) and Belgian utility Electrabel (B.ELE), which each hold 9.8%. These stakes will fall to 5.0% with the entry of the new investors, the threshold necessary to hold one seat on the board of directors. The exchange plans to initially offer physical electricity in hourly blocks for delivery the next day. Separately, EDF Trading, the London-based trading joint venture of EDF with commodities trader Louis Dreyfus, will start trading in the French wholesale market Oct. 1., EDF's Director of Client Services, Loic Caperan, said last week. EDF Trading is barred by the European Union Competition Authority from trading in the French retail market. The trading arm isn't allowed to assist EDF to structure contracts for France's energy-intensive industrial consumers, the group eligible to choose suppliers representing about one-third of domestic power consumption. But the entry of EDF Trading into the wholesale market is viewed by some traders as crucial to injecting necessary liquidity for electricity trading to flourish in France. The pace of power market deregulation is slowly starting to pick up in France. Powernext is the second project to launch this autumn aimed at kick-starting trading. Last week, EDF auctioned options on close to 1,200 megawatts of local power production. As the E.U.'s second-largest power market, which shares its borders with five countries and is connected to the U.K. via an under-water electricity interconnector, France is key to the eventual formation of a pan-European traded market. -By Sarah Wachter, Dow Jones Newswires; 331-4017-1740; sarah.wachter@dowjones.com -0- 17/09/01 09-56G Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

RWE to Buy American Water Works for $7.6 Billion (Update6) 2001-09-17 07:02 (New York) RWE to Buy American Water Works for $7.6 Billion (Update6) (Adds where American Water is based in second paragraph, moves stock drop to seventh, adds context in third paragraph.) Essen, Germany, Sept. 17 (Bloomberg) -- RWE AG, Europe's No. 4 power company, agreed to buy American Water Works Inc., the biggest publicly traded U.S. water utility, for $7.6 billion in cash and assumed debt in a bid to catch up with larger rivals. RWE is offering $46 in cash per share, 35 percent more than last Monday's close, for the Vorhees, New Jersey-based company. Germany's RWE will assume $3 billion of American Water's debt, said Chief Financial Officer Klaus Sturany on a conference call. The purchase will add more than 10 million U.S. customers to RWE's water unit and further reduce its reliance on the German electricity market. It will also help RWE narrow the gap to Suez SA and Vivendi Environnement SA a year after Chief Executive Dietmar Kuhnt spent $9.8 billion on Thames Water Plc of the U.K. ``RWE has said it wants to expand in water, and this is another step in that direction,'' said Ulf Moritzen, who helps manage 100 million euros ($93 million) at Nordinvest. ``In the current situation, it makes sense to buy a defensive business.'' The planned purchase isn't cheap. Including debt, RWE will pay about 5.4 times sales for the U.S. company, compared with 4.9 times sales for Thames Water. In the U.S., buyers paid about 4 times sales for the 15-plus takeovers in the country's water industry over the past two years, according to Bloomberg data. Stock Drops Including pending acquisitions by the U.S. company, the price will rise to about $8.4 billion by closing, said Sturany. RWE will sell an unspecified amount of new bonds to finance the purchase, he said, without giving a time frame. RWE shares fell as much as 2.27 euros, or 5.5 percent, to 38.90 euros in Frankfurt. They've declined 17 percent this year. American Water shares closed at $34.12 last Monday, the last day U.S. markets were open before the terrorist attacks. The acquisition is the biggest announced since terrorists attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon last Tuesday. Sturany said the companies reached an agreement last week, though they decided to delay the announcement because of the disaster. ``We have enormous confidence in the U.S. economy,'' Sturany said. ``Despite the enormity of the events, we expect the U.S. market to prevail.'' He said the contract with American Water doesn't include any special clauses related to the attack. After the purchase, which may take as long as two years to complete, the Essen, Germany-based company will have 56 million water customers worldwide, according to spokesman Bill McAndrews. Suez and Vivendi each serve more than 100 million people. More Purchases Sturany said American Water, which will become a unit of Thames Water, will expand further in the U.S. by using the German company's ``strong balance sheet.'' The Thames Water purchase last year gave RWE New Jersey-based utility E'town Corp. RWE said the new acquisition will make it the largest water company in the U.S., the world's biggest single market. American Water has customers in 23 U.S. states, the German company said. The U.S. market, with more than 54,000 local utilities, is ``ripe'' for consolidation, he said. RWE today said the latest purchase will help boost earnings before goodwill in the first year after completion. The company had sales of $1.35 billion last year and employs 5,000 people throughout the U.S. RWE's total debt will rise to about 8 billion euros ($7.4 billion) after the purchase, Sturany said. RWE's debt-to- equity ratio was about 2.8 before the purchase compared with 41 times for Vivendi Environnement, according to Bloomberg data. The yield on RWE's outstanding 6.5 percent 20-year bond rose 0.1659, or 0.2 percent, to 100.0455 after the announcement. RWE in April sold 3.46 billion euros worth of bonds to help pay for Thames Water, including 350 million pounds in 20-year bonds. RWE has an ``Aa3'' rating from Moodys' Investors Service and a ``AA-'' rating from rival agency Standard & Poor's. Merrill Lynch & Co. and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter advised RWE on the U.S. purchase. Goldman Sachs advised American Water. RWE said 24 percent of American Water's shareholders are already backing its takeover offer, which has also been approved by the German and the U.S. companies boards of directors. Enron India Unit Serves Second Notice to Cancel Power Contract 2001-09-17 08:50 (New York) Mumbai, Sept. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Dabhol Power Co., Enron Corp.'s Indian unit, said it has served a second notice on the state-owned Maharashtra State Electricity Board stating that it will start proceedings to cancel its power supply contract because its waiting to be paid past dues. Enron owns 65 percent of Dabhol Power Co., which runs the $3 billion power plant, India's biggest foreign investment. It is owed $64 million by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its sole customer, in unpaid bills for 9 months. The board in May stopped buying power, saying it's too expensive. ``Little progress has so far been made on reaching a fair and reasonable solution'' to the payments dispute, the company said in a statement. Enron on May 19 issued the first notice to cancel the power supply contract with the board. It began looking to sell its stake in the project after the negotiation panel failed to get other buyers for its power. Eight Indian states said they would buy electricity but at less than half the price charged by Dabhol. Enron said it has invested $875 million in the project and is ready to sell to the government its stake at cost.",Company Business/Strategy

Brulte =09 Greetings All: First, I am apologizing in advance for any typos in this email. Schedule i= s=20 very tight, but I wanted to make sure that everyone had it first thing this= =20 morning, with some back-up info that I've included below. Attached is the email that was sent to Ken Lay's office yesterday evening f= or=20 delivery to Sen. Brulte. It's of course confidential. Few points: I don't have Bev's email, so if you could please forward to her, that would= =20 be appreciated. As we discussed (Jim, Mike, Bev, Scott, Hedy) on our lengthy call on=20 Wednesday, I'm assuming that the plan is still to ""wallpaper"" Sacramento wi= th=20 our proposed legislation. This email does not contain the legislation. Mike sent the ""final"" version= s=20 of our legislation out yesterday, except for the siting piece, which I=20 believe Brian Cragg of Mike's office is finalizing today. You'll note that we promise Senator Brulte in the email that we'll deliver = to=20 his office today the proposed legislation. Again, based on our call on=20 Wednesday, I'm assuming that we would simultaneously release the proposed= =20 legislation to the rest of the world at the same time. When we spoke on Wednesday, we decided that the Sacramento team would=20 determine to whom we would circulate the proposed legislation at the same= =20 time that we deliver the Senator Brulte. I'm assuming that you folks will= =20 handle that end of things. Please let us know at your convenience to whom= =20 you've decided to circulate. This email does, however, include a ""summary"" of our proposed legislation. = =20 But I'm not certain that the summary included in this email is the=20 appropriate language to distribute ""to the world,"" or if we'll need instead= =20 to tailor some new language. I think we all agreed that we need a ""one=20 pager"" to accompany the legislative package so that we can communicate the= =20 package effectively. We also discussed the need to quickly develop a coalition to support our=20 proposals. We didn't finalize that plan. Perhaps the Sacramento team coul= d=20 propose a plan to do that. Perhaps we could start with our friends in the= =20 Direct Access coalition? We also talked about the need at this point to engage in PR and to get the = PR=20 machinery activated, also with the goal of effectively communicating our=20 legislative package/message. We're in a meeting with folks today where we= =20 can discuss getting that side of things going and Karen Denne has contacted= =20 Marathon and they're pondering some things that we can do in the near term. You'll note that there's a considerable amount of information about the DWR= =20 credit issue. As I recollect, we discussed the issue in depth on the call.= =20 You note that attached to the email is a ""legislative fix"" to AB1X that cou= ld=20 solve the credit issue and an attached set of ""taking points"" related to a= =20 second alternative to solving the credit issue: a PUC order clarifying tha= t=20 DWR will get its money for power purchase costs. Note also that Steve Kean reminded me that we've got to continue to push to= =20 get the utilities out of the merchant function. Accordingly, I've put a=20 brief paragraph on that issue in the note to Brulte in the last section=20 (legislative solution) under the topic ""create a real competitive retail=20 market in California."" To the best of my knowledge, we don't have=20 legislative language on that piece yet, and it seems that we'll need to=20 discuss it in considerably more depth before doing so.

Key Barriers to Distributed Generation Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Stand-by Charges Solution: The executive orders issued by the Governor on February 14th took= a=20 step in the right direction. Utility stand-by charges have always been=20 designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position, extract=20 monopoly prices from customers, or both. But there is no reason to limit t= he=20 elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than=20 1MW. These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for= =20 California to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduc= e=20 the risk of black outs this summer. We would propose lifting the cap by=20 offering amendments to SB27X, which is designed to facilitate development o= f=20 distributed generation. =20 Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with=20 investor-owned and municipal utilities Solution: The Governor=01,s executive order regarding interconnection is = a=20 step in the right direction=01*D-D-26-01 requires utilities to complete=20 interconnection studies within 7 days. California should ensure that this= =20 requirement applies to all generation facilities, including distributed=20 generation. In addition, the financial conflicts the utilities face when= =20 interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome= =20 through executive orders or other regulations. To the greatest extent=20 possible, California should shift control over interconnection away from th= e=20 utility and place that control with the California ISO. This could be=20 accomplished through amendments to SB 27X. Permitting and Air Quality Issues Developers of distributed (i.e., =01&on-site=018) generation that is 50 MWs= or=20 greater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission an= d=20 therefore face all of the impediments to development that large-scale=20 generation faces. =20 Solution: California should ensure that the executive orders (D-22-01 thru= =20 D-26-01) issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant= =20 output apply equally to smaller scale, =01&distributed generation=018 facil= ities.=20 In addition, distributed generation that is less than 50 MWs continues to= =20 face local opposition. The State should ensure that local, parochial=20 interests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects= . =20 These objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SB27X. 3. Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in AB1X to Purchase= =20 Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities=20 Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with= =20 suppliers. Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th= e=20 goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible. However, ambiguities contained in AB1X have created significant credit risk= =20 concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms. We understand that the lion=01,s share of counterparties share Enron=01,s c= redit=20 risk concerns. Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and= =20 is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to= =20 both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements= =20 going forward. Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority The language in AB1X is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to=20 charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power. From our= =20 analysis of the bill, the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the=20 California PUC=01,s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California. = As=20 such, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat= es=20 adequate charges to cover DWR=01,s costs of power purchases. Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract =01&Prudence=018 The language in AB1X leaves open the possibility that the California Public= =20 Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are= =20 =01&imprudent.=018 On the basis of such a finding, the CPUC could then ref= use to=20 allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power=20 purchases. Consequently, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr= ee=20 to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that= =20 DWR has entered into with suppliers. =20 Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to= =20 Recover DWR=01,s Costs of Power Purchases In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority= =20 noted above, the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to= =20 the specific ratemaking =01&mechanics=018 that AB1X directs the PUC to empl= oy to=20 permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs. Based on our analysis, it i= s=20 extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu= re=20 DWR recovers its power purchase costs. Moreover, as currently drafted, it = is=20 difficult to determine whether AB1X would even permit the PUC to include in= =20 rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWR=01,s power purchase= =20 costs. Again, this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since= =20 suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover= =20 from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power. Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk=20 We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri= sk=20 issues. We have identified three options: Amend AB1X The amendments, which are attached to this email, would clarify that a) the= =20 PUC would accept as =01&prudent and reasonable=018 all purchase costs incur= red by=20 DWR, and b) the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary = to=20 ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases. This is the= =20 preferred option, though we understand that the there may be some political= =20 challenges standing in the way of amending AB1X. (See attached file=20 entitled, =01&AmendAB1X.doc=018.) Clarify the Ambiguities in AB1X through an Order Issued by the PUC, and=20 through Contract Language This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to=20 implement. However, it is more complicated and could take significantly mo= re=20 time to implement than the ""legislative"" fix. We have attached electronic= =20 copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC= =20 would need to issue under this option. (See attached file entitled,=20 Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk As indicated in our letter responding to DWR=01,s RFP, we are willing to ac= cept=20 other forms of credit from DWR. Those options include a letter of credit,= =20 cash prepayment, or an acceptable form of collateral. DWR officials have= =20 indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options. That is, DWR= =20 prefers to clarify the ambiguities in AB1X through a PUC order and through= =20 contract amendments. 4. California=01,s Supply-demand Picture Heading into Summer 2001 Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research=20 Associates (CERA), a private sector energy think tank, have issued reports= =20 showing that California faces a severe supply-demand imbalance. They diffe= r=20 only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available. Al= l=20 credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer= =20 of 2001 and that unless a solution is found immediately, blackouts are=20 likely. =20 CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this=20 summer by approximately 5,000 MW. These numbers are in line with our=20 estimates. California=01,s supply base currently has a 6% capacity margin,= well=20 below the average 15-20%, which is recommended for reliable system operatio= n=20 in the West. Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power= =20 than other regions, reserves are particularly important, owing to the=20 unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t= o=20 date. In the event of a low rain and snow period, the system must possess t= he=20 flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply. =20 California=01,s very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to = this=20 requirement. =20 Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of 2001 include the early= =20 draw-down of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage California's seve= re=20 supply-demand gap; emissions restrictions on existing plants; and a reduced= =20 number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the=20 utilities. Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren= t=20 pace of siting, permitting and construction, adequate supplies will not be= =20 added to correct the market imbalance until 2003 at the earliest. CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately 20 hours of= =20 rolling black outs this summer. The CEC paints a considerably more=20 optimistic scenario, betting that California will bring an additional 5,000= =20 MWs on line to meet peaking summer demand. It is our view that California= =20 should view the CEC's ""rosy scenario"" with considerable skepticism. 5. Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California= =01,s=20 Electricity Crisis This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution. We wil= l=20 deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing= =20 bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals. As we have suggested throughout the crisis, any solution to California's=20 crisis must focus on four issues: Increase supply Decrease demand Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency Increase supply--Legislative vehicle: SB28X (Sher) To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately 2 years. = =20 Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less= =20 than a year. In California, it takes about six years, or longer. The Governor=01,s executive orders and Senator Sher=01,s siting reform legi= slation=20 are steps in the right direction. Our suggested amendments can improve tho= se=20 efforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face= =20 in securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit=20 requirements included in the CEC's certification requirements. Enron=01,s= =20 proposal seeks to streamline the process for 1) obtaining credits and 2)=20 transfering credits between air districts. In addition, it creates an=20 innovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund=20 emissions in advance of obtaining certification, and permits the affected a= ir=20 districts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the=20 required reductions in pollution emissions. Decrease demand=01*Legislative Vehicle: AB31X (Wright) Because of the delay in getting a solution in place in California, closing= =20 the supply-demand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the= =20 best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer. This can be accomplished mo= st=20 effectively and quickly in two ways: Buy-down demand California is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun= d=20 to finance DWR=01,s power purchases. California could likely reduce demand= more=20 economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou= ld=20 be willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period (e.g.,= =20 through the summer months). DWR could easily run an on-line auction to=20 determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions. To=20 participate, businesses would be required to have the metering equipment=20 necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the=20 reductions. Enron has developed an on-line auction software package, =01&D= eal=20 Bench,=018 that it would be willing to contribute to the effort. Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment To be successful, customers need access to the following key elements: An internet based hour-ahead price posting system to track the market price= =20 for hour-ahead power in real time.=20 Real-time metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment= =20 verification.

We further estimate= =20 that the market response to this program from all ESPs could be 2 to 3 time= s=20 that amount. We recommend that the State of California provide rebates=20 directly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and=20 control systems that would support load curtailment implementation. Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market=01*Legislative vehi= cle:=20 SB27X The only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we= re=20 customers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy= =20 service providers. Ironically, AB1X takes that important option away from= =20 customers and businesses. It is critical that AB1X be amended to remove th= e=20 prohibition against Direct Access. Enron's legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a= =20 direct access transaction, while simultaneously addressing the Department o= f=20 Water Resources' concerns about stranded power costs that might result from= =20 customer migration. =20 In addition, California will only achieve a competitive retail market when= =20 the utility is removed completely from the procurement function. Procureme= nt=20 is not a utility core competency, as evidenced by the dire financial=20 condition in which the utilities now find themselves. California should=20 therefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement=20 function entirely, with the goal of having all customers served by a=20 non-utility provider within 36 months. To execute the transition, Californ= ia=20 should hold a series of competitive solicitations over the 36-month period = in=20 which competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments= =20 of utility load. Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency=01*Legislative = vehicle:=20 AB18X Utility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand= . =20 In short, bankruptcy does nothing to solve California=01,s supply-demand=20 imbalance.

Finally, bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidenc= e=20 in California's energy markets and the private sector's willingness to=20 participate in that market.

<4131316.1075840896739.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,FW: Bingaman Draft On Transparency -- Amendment Ideas,"Louise -- LIsa Yoho suggested I forward the attached e-mail from yesterday on a conversation Linda Robertson and I had on the transparency issue. My apologies for not including you on the original distribution list, as I should have done. Your comments are most welcome. John Shelk -----Original Message----- From: Shelk, John Sent: Tuesday, September 11, 2001 9:51 AM To: Robertson, Linda; Long, Chris; Shapiro, Richard; Yoho, Lisa; Briggs, Tom; Nicolay, Christi L.; Steffes, James D. Subject: Bingaman Draft On Transparency -- Amendment Ideas Last night, Linda and I spent a fairly long time with Leon Lowery, Chairman Bingaman's chief electricity advisor, to discuss our concerns with the transparency and market-based rate language -- while at the same time commending the transmission access language in the draft and strategizing how to support the chairman in that regard. We made progress on transparency, less so on market-based rates. On transparency, Leon understands our concerns. In a nutshell, he seemed amenable to amending the langauge to avoid the result of having to divulge transaction-specific, trade-specific information. We persuaded Leon that was the impact of the initial language, although he initially said details would be left to FERC. We persuaded him that if any data is to be provided, it MUST be only in aggregate form. We also impressed on him that if, as he said, the intent is to leave details to FERC -- then more of the details should be left to FERC, not set by statute. Leon strongly advised that we seek to craft language consistent with the above exchange that makes as few changes to the draft as needed to make the necessary corrections. This will make it easier for Leon to navigate the internal waters of the staff. (Sam Fowler, th chief counsel, is a drafting stickler). Others should obviously weigh in and review this, but to facilitate internal comments (we need to get back to Leon today), here is my take on what he has in mind. Under new sec. 218(b) (to be added to the FPA by bill sec. 413) (pg. 13), under ""information required"" we would rewrite paragraph 2 as follows: (2) each broker, exchange, or other market-making entity that matches offers to sell and offers to buy wholesale electric energy in interstate commerce to provide aggregate statistical information about its sales of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce. The effect of the language change is drop the reference to sale prices of each sale of electric energy. By leaving it as aggregate statistical information, this should give FERC maximum flexibility to permit indexes, etc. As to the ""timely basis"" of information release (subsection (c)), the alternatives sent yesterday would require this to be done on the Internet after the end of the trading day. If we can restrict this to aggregate data, question arises whether we want to concede that this would be done daily. That suggests the data to be collected would be more than we would want, I think. Here is a take on how we might suggest a revision to that language to give FERC more leeway: ""(c) TIMELY BASIS -- The Commission shall require the information required under subsection (b) to be posted on the Internet and updated as frequently as practicable and appropriate. The change is to add ""appropriate"" so that FERC can consider other than whether posting is practicable. The use of ""appropriate"" is what came to mind -- perhaps there is some other word or phrase like ""consistent with ..."" or ""promote competition"" or some way of saying there are policy considerations other than practicability. There should be some valid purpose established before data is released. I would argue that the (d) language on commercially sensitive information goes only to exempting from disclosure, not when disclosure is appropriate. Please let me have your thoughts, although the tragedy in NYC and DC now underway will probably make this not a day to transact such business on the Hill. Will provide a further report on market-based rates. In sum, Leon was not as sympathetic on this issue, but asked for our ideas and further arguments. We sense Leon personally feels strongly about moving the FPA to some linkage to competitive markets. His argument is that market participants can be doing everything by the book and the result can still be uncompetitive markets. We pushed that penalizing us is not the answer -- nor is increasing regulatory uncertainty about deals doing to help keep prices down. Leon clearly does not intend this language to punish Enron -- but others who we might all agree have done things that are not in keeping with competitive markets.",Company Business/Strategy
