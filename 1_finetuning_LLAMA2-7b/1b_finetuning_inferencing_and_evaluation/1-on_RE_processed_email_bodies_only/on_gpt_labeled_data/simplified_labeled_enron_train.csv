forgot to hit the reply to all button when i responded to rich fri nov rich ferguson mike florio wohin gehen wir cc eteam rich i like the idea but im not sure im a very good test case after all i have been branded a the last living defender of command and control regulation socialist central planning and everything else bad that youve ever thought of could the role of calpower be better filled by an existing forprofit company eg enron no way any private seller would have all the same conflict a the utility and then some but michael shame is interested in the idea of auctioning off all or part of the retail franchise in san diego since sdge doesnt seem to want to be in the business anymore i have been pushing a corenoncore distinction such a you suggest although i havent been bold enough to suggest a nonprofit procurement entity i did push this idea for pges gas procurement back in the bad old gas accord day but the idea got nowhere then what ive talked about is including the retained at least for now generation in the core portfolio along with some contract and some spot havent developed any number yet i would certainly encourage shopping the idea seller will probably hate it because this entity would have more market buying power than even the current udcs but so what thats what we want right id suggest running it by bill julian for a political straight face test but i would guess hed like it and it would be a perfect vehicle for rps which we would certainly like to revive let keep exploring this mike at pm you wrote folk i am growing increasingly worried about future public policy oversight of utility power purchase given the current conventional wisdom that more long term purchase should be made i have been promoting the notion that the default power portfolio should be maintained by a new nonprofit quasipublic entity with revenue guaranteed by the puc rather than by three separate iou subject or not to reasonableness review your comment on this notion are eagerly sought purchasing power for default customer the recently proposed ferc decision essentially put california back where it wa in there appears to be near universal agreement that the iou should enter into long term power purchase agreement and limit exposure to the spot market a you recall the brpu reached the same conclusion decided how much should be purchased held the auction etc and then ferc blew it up after deciding that the state avoided cost estimate were wrong ferc appears now to agree it made a mistake and essentially order u to start the process all over again however the proposed order make no mention of state oversight of utility purchase but at the briefing held last wednesday for bowen and legislative staff ferc staff made it clear that they were not mandating any alternative to replace the must sellbuy requirement that they were eliminating presumably the state could still mandate the iou buy in the px or whatever and still comply with the ferc order a long a the utility remain regulated by the puc the state can control their power purchase the problem is that after screwing around for ten year there is now enormous pressure to let the utility do what they will a result that i fear would be bad for consumer and bad for the environment on the other hand there no time nor stomach for repeating the brpu process my preferred solution is the establishment of a new not for profit utility that would make power portfolio decision for default customer let call it calpower the three existing regulated utility would no longer sell energy at retail calpower decision would be subject to whatever public policy condition the legislature andor the puc chose to impose however some kind expedited review process would allow calpower to be very nimble in the power market and recovery of their revenue requirement would be guaranteed direction of calpower could be by political appointee elected representative or some combination my fantasy is a governance structure similar to calpers in which broad legislative guideline are interpreted by a board of director and implemented by experienced trader compared to the present structure in which default portfolio are designed by three different forprofit utility calpower appears to have the following advantage the nonprofit structure eliminates all financial conflict of interest in portfolio design and ensures optimum implementation of public policy goal it ensures equitable treatment of all customer statewide with price difference reflecting market reality rather than differing purchase criterion by each utility it allows calpower to be a nimble in the market a any other commercial trader by allowing the puc or other state agency to participate in portfolio design issue upfront rather than requiring lengthy after the fact review calpowers disadvantage appears to be that it requires yet another new statechartered nonprofit organization politician appear intent on blaming the two they have already and returning to the old utilitycentric system rather than risk their neck by proposing solution that they then would be responsible for obviously there are many question and detail to be worked out which customer would be default customer my option would be to declare all customer under kw permanent default customer green or other marketer could participate through contract for difference but physical power would be acquired for all these customer by calpower customer kw would be on their own what is the relationship with the puc with the legislature could the role of calpower be better filled by an existing forprofit company eg enron how are the benefitscosts of existing utility generation asset and pp contract shared etc is this concept attractive enough to be worth pursuing the next step would be to get a group of interested party together to put some meat on these bone and float the idea seriously perhaps even get some draft legislation on paper to shop around interested let me know regard rich,"Company Business, Strategy, etc."
