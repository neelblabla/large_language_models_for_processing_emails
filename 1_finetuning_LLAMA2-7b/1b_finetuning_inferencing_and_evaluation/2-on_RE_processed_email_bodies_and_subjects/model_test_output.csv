They are what Kelly reviewed with you in your initial meeting regarding the subject.

The first two categories are obvious. I'd like to know what to put in the remaining categories.
I think that the  \em{Document Edit Check} category is related to the \strong{Collaborative Editing} feature of Microsoft Word. However I don't know if the other categories have a similar meaning. If someone can explain what these categories mean I would appreciate it. Thanks."

Subject:: Re: Presidential Power Question
Body:: thanks From: Sarah Novosel on 05/23/2001 02:54 PM To: Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Linda Robertson/NA/Enron@ENRON Subject: Presidential Power Question I spoke with Donna Bobbish this morning about Steve's question -- does the President have broader authority to take action during times of crisis. Donna sent me this quick write up about what she has looked into so far. Because these questions go beyond a FERC practitioner's expertise we asked Donna to work with a Constitutional Law expert at V&E to determine whether and under what circumstances the President's authority may be extended beyond the authorities discussed in the memo. We will let you know what we learn from that further research. Sarah

Subject:: Challenge to exercise of Eminent Domain - Confidential Attorney
 Work Product
Body:: Although I don't yet have all the facts Steve Hall said that late yesterday (Friday) afternoon the Governor exercised eminent domain over the IOU forward contracts that the PX had been in the process of auctioning to pay PX participants. I would like Bracewell to research at least the following two possible ways this action is unlawful. First this violates the banking provisions of the PX tariff (Section 6). These provisions requires the PX to hold all PX accounts in trust for PX participants. Second these are wholesale contracts and the State only has the right to exercise eminent domain concerning retail service. I don't have any law to support the second idea but think it should be researched nonetheless.

This is a binary classification task. We use logistic regression to model the categorizing function. This is because we have categorical variables in the training data and we want to use the same variables for prediction. Logit models are also more robust than linear models to non-linearities in data. In this case we use a logit model with the \strong{identity link function}.

As you know her firm represents the Government of India. She initiated the conversation on India and our issues there saying something to the effect that the firm has told the Indian government how important Enron is and how close Ken is to the White House. They also told the Embassy that the issue would NOT likely come up in the Bush meeting with the PM since the Finance Minister will be in town for World Bank meetings and they assumed it would come up at that level. I said I was not handling the issue. She said the firm would be open to trying to work out the issue or help with same in bringing the two sides together. Also reminded me that Sen. Dole is at the firm. All I said on substance was that certainly India understood the importance of this issue on the foreign investment climate there. FYI. John

My recollection is that in the NERC version of the bill they walled off the funding in a manner we would find objectionable but let me double check that fact.

Body:: When we have described the problems and solutions for California we have focussed on generation siting and flexibility to hedge. We have stayed away from transmission issues on the assumption that California with its ISO and PX does not suffer from the same discrimination issues as other parts of the country. Is this true? Does California's system layer in priorities for utility use of the system -- eg doesn't PG&E control path 15? Does that control provide advantageous access to PG&E? Are there other examples and are there links between these preferences and the current problems in California? As we are trying to convert reliability and pricing concerns into FERC action these would be helpful arguments to have available to us.

There always seems to be reluctance in UK to have a dash prepared Steve always used a huge amount of energy on justifying the task. We all know that if problem deals are not addressed they always get worse. Maybe Michael could be led to suggest an alternative memo or approach. A problem deal memo. If you all think a dash is the best approach do it and I don't care if they don't sign it. Once the website is functional it will be helpful to have a complete history of deals and having these kind of memos in dash format will aid this process. One final thought Michael is quite supportive of our effort and I think we should pick battles carefully. Rick

Subject:: White House To Support FERC Action Today
Body:: According to this morning's Washington Post the Bush Administration will support the expected FERC action today of extending the existing California price mitigation regime to 10 other Western states and to all days/all hours not just during California emergencies (stages 1 2 and 3). This action comes only a day before FERC and other witnesses will testify on the Feinstein/Smith price cap legislation before the Senate Energy Committee Gov. Davis and FERC will testify before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee on Wednesday and the House Financial Services Committee joins the fray with a hearing on the California energy situation on Wednesday. The latter committee will probably base its jurisdiction over some aspect of energy policy on a number of factors including its jurisdiction over presidential economic emergency powers. The committee staff has in the past expressed interest in derivatives and other financial aspects of energy trading and markets. We are checking now to quietly determine whether these issues will be on Wednesday's agenda.

Also I think it would be a good idea to have a get together after work once a month or so for the Public Affairs organization. Nothing fancy . . . Cadillac Bar or something similar. . . spouses and significant others invited. Talk it over with a couple of people in the group and let me know what you come up with. -----------------

Subject:: Re: EES - RAC Deal Approval Meeting
Body:: I understood the validation process to be a fairly flexible name applied to a wide variety of approaches. What we specifically discussed and what scott s. left prepared and committed to do involved looking at individual curves the assumptions underlying them and some process (yet to be specifically determined) for addressing updates. We agreed to start with the top 20 curves and especially those which are involved in the upcoming deals. I think the confusion is in what the term validation means. In the ENA context it means one thing in this context it means what we discussed (which was in Jim's memo and as you'll recall we went through point-by-point).

 prepare--Confidential Atty Client Work Product
Body:: I met with Gary Fergus and we determined the need to prepare affidavits and/or exhibits as part of our August 15th showing in the Califronia refund case. Exhbits in a FERC case require supporting documents and a sponsor (witness). I am trying to contact various people on getting the data together but here are the parameters of the exhibits: Witness designations are preliminary. 1. EPMI's receivables from ISO/PX What it shows: ISO owes us $41.5 million and the PX $9.1 million plus any claims we want to make w.r.t. letters of credit with the PX Sponsor: Tracy Ngo (PX data) and Murray O'Neil (ISO data) (Tracy has agreed to prepare the exhibit but wants support from Murray's group on the ISO numbers.) 2. EPMI's receivables from ISO for the underscheduling penalty What it shows: ISO has yet to actually implement the underscheduling penalty but has been tracking it. According to information provided Chris Stockly EPMI would receive $30 million of penalty revenues Sponsor: Chris Stokley or Murray O'Neil 3. Enron's PX credit receivables What it shows: PG&E and SCE collectively owe EES $500 million Sponsor: Steve Swain or ?? GAC

Subject:: Next NERC Reliability Meeting on Legislation -- August 9th
Body:: See NERC memo below that was just received. They have scheduled what they hope will be the final meeting to resolve the reliability legislation next week -- August 9th. Of course this is awfully presumptuous in that it assumes that the model to be worked off of is the NERC model (even the shortened one) and not the PJM model that others prefer to use. We need to decide whether we suggest any changes to the shortened NERC version even those we know they would not take just to show a willingness to offer specific comments as we promised at the last meeting or simply agree to disagree. -----------------

My program should output the category 'V.Fox' (since that is the only category that has the subject 'Dinner'). I am using the `NLTK` package for natural language processing.
I tried using `nltk.pos_tag(body)` to get the part-of-speech tags but this gives me a list of tags like 'NN"

Body:: Thanks for getting on top of this. Please get the word out to the HR team leaders as soon as you know more. From: Aaron Brown/ENRON@enronXgate on 07/13/2001 11:36 AM To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron Mary Joyce/ENRON@enronXgate cc: Subject: Enron's PaineWebber Service Rocky Emery the Dowd family Kim Bowden and another 15 or so employees of UBSPaineWebber (our stock tracking provider...options restricted stock etc) left yesterday evening without any warning. They went to 1st Union. I've set up a meeting at 2pm today for us to go over to UBSPW and make sure they understand the special needs of Enron and to make sure our service will not be affected. I am reviewing the contract in place between PW and Enron to understand the affects of this move by Emery and his staff on the agreement. Also I'm going to see about getting 2 providers of the stock tracking service from the following list: (in case this happens again we'll have a solid back-up immediately) UBSPaineWEbber (our current provider) 1st Union (where Rocky Emery went) Solomon Smith Barney (way ahead of the competition from a technology standpoint...and has done the two provider thing before) Prudential (another option with internal connections) let me know if you think I should include any others or would like to discuss. Thanks Aaron
