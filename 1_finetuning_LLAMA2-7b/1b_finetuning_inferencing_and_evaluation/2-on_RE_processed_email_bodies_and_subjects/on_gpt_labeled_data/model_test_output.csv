Yes, I am fine. My wife had a baby girl on Wednesday. She is doing great. It is hard to believe that it has been almost a year since we started the M&A group. We have accomplished a great deal and have a very good group of people. However, we have also had our share of setbacks and we still have many challenges ahead of us. In the last year, our group has grown to over people, including several people who have joined the group since our last meeting. Our group now has people working in Houston, New York, Toronto, London, and Calgary. The group is working on a number of important transaction and project. Since our previous meeting, the energy group and the corporate group have completed the acquisition of Hydro One. This transaction is one that will have an impact on Enron for many years to come. Hidro One is the largest electric utility in Canada and has over million customers"

</INST> Logistic arrangement meeting schedulin technical suport etc  everybody knows that when you go to the casino you are not going to win but the game is so much fun that you can not stop playing i think this is what the extra cash is all about the risk reward ratio is too good to pass up in my opinion i would pay you to let me be your opponent and i will pay the same amount that i have to pay for the software and the time it takes to run the program i am not sure how much i should bid or offer but i guess i can start with and let the market determine the price the only thing that would be important to me is that we play a fair game and that the odds are the way they are supposed to be i dont think that is a problem for you either do you think i need to offer more or less i wa not planning to use the cfg file so i could play it on my own computer if that makes a difference also i havent played chess in a while and would like to brush up on some of my skill before we start playing any advice on how to get better i hope to hear from you soon thanks john

The funny thing is that this is the only email that we have for this category. I know that I am the one who categorizes all the email and I thought that there would be more than this.
