Subject:: analystassociate program
Body:: dear mr lavorato i am writing you to express my dissapointment about how the whole aa issue with ubs wa handled i have been working for a year a an analyst in the gas risk management group in that period i learned a lot about risk and trading and eventhough sometimes we worked crazy hour i thought i had this incredible job and i worked with the best people in the industry how few of u get a chance like that i wa looking forward to my next rotation in the origination group when the whole enron scandal started happening even when we filed the bankruptcy i still knew that the trading group will survive and i wa right but i never thought that the management will so easily forget about the analyst and not even try to negotiate analyst salary with ubs that all of u knew were the lowest in the market and i am completely sure ubs knew that too but why would they pay u more when our own management did not stand behind u i remember the time when i wa working till pm or sometimes even longer but since i had this incredible group of people to work with i always thought someone would recognize that but it look like that it doe not matter anymore how much you work but who do you know mr lavorato i wanted to share this with you because i know that you can make a difference and that you always cared about the aa program eventhough it may be late for me it would be a great loss for the company if all these smart people start leaving many of them are the brightest individual i ever met and i think they are the future of ubs trading group i hope that you will at least think about what i said because i know that you have a lot on your mind i wish you a lot of success in this year sincerely anna kulic gas risk management

Subject:: re market opinion about aga
Body:: interesting observationbut im not sure i agree i think consensus opinion is that anything under tcf is very dangerous entering the winter a month ago analyst were predicting we would end the injection season with around in the ground with the most recent aga those projection seem to be closer to with supply of gas very inelastic to price in the short and medium term you must look at the demand side of the equation the market is trying to price out the right amount of demand mostly through lost industrial load and fuel switching such that supply will be stored rather than burned each aga number is another data point a to whether nat gas is high enough to price out enough demand to reach a comfortable level in storage entering the winter a low aga number indicates we havent priced out enough demand and the market must go up certainly the throw a curve in the bull argument but the number may be a function of very mild weather a four day holiday weekend and reporting noise rather than indicative of a structural shift in the supplydemand equilibrium well know a lot more a the next two week number come out if we get two low injection watch out enron north america corp frank hayden enron pm john cc market opinion about aga john i think the aga are not a important to bull a to bear in the beginning of the season aga were very important in framing the bull case the current expectation is that we will go into the winter under stored i dont believe any additional aga news can significantly change that expectation however i believe bear a evidenced today will feed more heavily off of bearish aga news than bull will off bullish aga news at this juncture i believe that the most potent bullish news ha to come from the physical market and weather i hope you dont mind me expressing my view point on this issue thanks frank

Subject:: bammel lease question
Body:: i wa wondering if the bammel lease to aep contains any operating parameter to protect the integrity of the facility the question arises from the fact that bammel had about bcf of remaining capacity when enron turned the facility over to aep we believe their plan is to max inject in june which would reduce the remaining capacity to around bcf it could become a challenge to keep injection under the remaining bcf level during the reaming month of the injection cycle enron always operated the facility with the understanding that a gas in place volume greater than bcf could create a high enough pressure to jeopardize the safety of the wellhead casing and some of the abandoned well we would not want the texas rrc to question the safety of the bammel facility from the other end of the perspective if the gas in place is taken below bcf their is a high probability of watering out the outer well and the facility itself

Subject:: employee morale
Body:: john a dangerous environment is brewing on the trading floor we have very large position and people are becoming more frustrated with the work environment uncertain about future employment and now with new information about lay golden parachute i am concerned that not everyone may act in the best interest of the company hero or zero attitude or at a minimum may not be in the best frame of mind to trade i hate to suggest it but do you need to reduce the people allowed to take risk for the company similar to what wa done when we sold hpl the general feeling is that everyone at the top is taking care of themselves and the little people that have been making the money for the company are left out in the cold i also suggest that you move quickly to ensure appropriate compensation for key trader into next year i know the first move i suggested would have the effect of reducing morale further but this group ha a lot of risk on for people that may not be commited to enron this may be too drastic action at this point but i think it should watched closely
