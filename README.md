# large_language_models_for_processing_emails


### Using LLM to automate e-mail processing for Deutsche Bahn

1) Mails (in German and Englisch) are provided by text document, in the text documents all characteristics are contained (From, To, Subject, Mailtext).
2) For a part of the mails, instructions are given, e.g. contact person A, ...
3) Now a large language model is to be trained by means of the given instructions.
4) On the sample, which is not provided with instructions, the result of the training is to be evaluated.

The project should also address how to set up this holistically (i.e., classifying and learning from a single source), one possibility would be to use doccano, for example.
